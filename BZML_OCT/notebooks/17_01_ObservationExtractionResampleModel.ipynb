    "Kepler's \"New Astronomy (Astronomia Nova)\" was completed and published in Linz in 1609. Buried deep in this, at times very mystical book, is Kepler's first formulation of his first and second laws of planetary motion, which in modern parlance can be stated as follows:\n",
    "*  Planetary orbits are ellipses, with the Sun located at one focus;\n",
    "*  Planets move along their elliptical orbit with a speed such that a line segment joining the planet to the Sun sweeps equal surface areas in equal time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time he reconceptualized \"oppositions\" as based upon the observed, rather than \"average,\" position of the Sun, Kepler analyzed Brahe's individual **observations** of Mars for potential errors of various other kinds. with this introduction observations, sentiments play an important role in tracking the knowledge. This motivates us to:  \n",

    "- provide two models to classify the explicit observational sentences of the book using machine learning #ref"

       "4  When, in my early years, I was able to taste the sweetness of philosophy, I embraced the whole of it with an overwhelming desire, and with practically no special concern about astronomy. I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions. These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.   \n",

Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64° from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5’ 24“. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1° 9’ 45“ north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26°, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2’ 38“. But Mars is 40° from the nonagesimal, counting from 4° Scorpio to 24° Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2’ 38“ shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1...   \n",
