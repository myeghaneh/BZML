    "Kepler's \"New Astronomy (Astronomia Nova)\" was completed and published in Linz in 1609. Buried deep in this, at times very mystical book, is Kepler's first formulation of his first and second laws of planetary motion, which in modern parlance can be stated as follows:\n",
    "*  Planetary orbits are ellipses, with the Sun located at one focus;\n",
    "*  Planets move along their elliptical orbit with a speed such that a line segment joining the planet to the Sun sweeps equal surface areas in equal time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time he reconceptualized \"oppositions\" as based upon the observed, rather than \"average,\" position of the Sun, Kepler analyzed Brahe's individual **observations** of Mars for potential errors of various other kinds. with this introduction observations, sentiments play an important role in tracking the knowledge. This motivates us to:  \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.   \n",

This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. It therefore should have been 25° 8’ 32” Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9.   \n",

There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. They took the value of 3° 58’ 10”. The former is closer to the sun’s mean position.  \n",

Consequently, at that moment Mars was at 26° 35’ 31” Sagittarius. There is no need to consider any horizontal variations in longitude, since Mars is at mid-sky and at the beginning of Capricorn. The table has 26° 32’ Sagittarius.  \n",

       "1016         On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3° 30’ Cancer, and again at 4° 1’ Cancer, the mean being 3° 45½’ Cancer ^16. The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1° 15’ westward. Therefore, Mars would have been at 2° 30½’ Cancer. In the table, it was put at 2° 28’. The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date. Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind. Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely. But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man’s lifetime, for examining Mars’s parallax.  \n",
