       " AM, old style.Chapter 1On the distinction between the first motion and the second or proper motions; and in the proper motions, between the first and the second inequality.The testimony of the ages confirms that the motions of the planets are orbicular.Reason, having borrowed from experience, immediately presumes this: that their gyrations are perfect circles.For among figures it is circles, and among bodies the heavens, that are considered the most perfect.However, when experience seems to teach something different to those who pay careful attention, namely, that the planets deviate from a simple circular path, it gives rise to a powerful sense of wonder, which at length drives people to look into causes.It is just this from which astronomy arose among humans.Astronomy's aim is considered to be to show why the stars' motions appear to be irregular on earth, despite their being exceedingly well ordered in heaven, and to investigate the specific circles whereby the stars may be moved, so that by their aid the positions and appearances of those stars at any given time may be predicted.Before the distinction between the first motion(1) and the second motions(2) was established, people noted (in contemplating the sun, moon and stars) that their diurnal paths were visually very nearly equivalent to circles.These were, however, entwined one upon another like yarn on a ball, and the circles were for the most part smaller(3) circles of the sphere, rarely the greatest(4) (suchas here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south.They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion.The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I).The sun (on ABE) is slower, as on the following day it stands at E and so its setting follows that of the fixed stars at I with which on the previous day it was conjoined on HA.Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG).Hence the Pythagoreans, when they shared out musical tones among the stars, gave the lowest (the hypate among the strings of the lyre)1 to the moon, because the motions of both were slowest.Hence have originated the words ÏÏÎ¿Î·Î³Î¿á½»Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï and á½ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ¹ÏÏÎ¹Îºá½¹Ï ^2.The former of these terms originally corresponded to a star which, on the next day, comes to its setting earlier (the sun E is said to be ÏÏÎ¿Î·Î³Î¿á½»Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï with respect to the moon G).The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I).For more on this subject see our Optics, Ch.10.3This first adumbration of astronomy consists, not of the unfolding of a cause, but solely of the experience of the eyes, extremely slowly acquired.It cannot be explained in figures or numbers, nor can it be extrapolated into the future, since it is always different from itself, to the extent that no spiral is equal to any other in increments of time, and none carries over into the next with a curvature of the same quantity.Nevertheless, there are some people today who, riding roughshod over two thousand years' work, care, erudition, and knowledge, are trying to revive this, obtruding admiration of themselves far and wide (an attempt which has not been fruitless among the ignorant).Those with more experience consider them with good reason to be incompetent, or (if, like that man Patricius,4 they want to be known as philosophers) to act mad with reasoning.For it was helpful to astronomers to understand that two simple motions, the first one and the second ones, the common and the proper, are intermingled, and that from this mingling that continuous sequence of conglomerated motions follows.And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile.When a planet (such as the moon at G) is \"left behind\" (by the sun at E or the fixed stars at I), it is carried in consequence*  through FG more swiftly than the sun (through AE) or the fixed stars (through HI).It, however, it appears to be 'leading' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion.For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at P while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP.This turned out to be of great profit in astronomy in grasping the simplicity  of the motions.Instead of unending spirals, a new one always being added to the end of the earlier one at E or G, there remained little but the solitary circles FG and AE, and a single common motion, either of all the planets and the whole world as well in a direction opposite to the proper motions, or (with the world standing still, according to Aristarchus) of the earth's globe T around the axis QR in the same direction as the proper motions.Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them.For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observedâless striking to the eyesâbecause the diurnal motion was very swift.And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals.But now, that minute division and distribution of the star's proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously.First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun.For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen.At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion.From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5.And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence.If one were to bundle all this together, and were at the same time to believe that the sun really moves through the zodiac in the space of a year, as Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe believed, he would then have to grant that the circuits of the three superior planets through the aethereal space, composed as they are of several motions, are real spirals, not (as before) in the manner of balled up yarn, with spirals set side by side, but more like the shape of a pretzel,6 as in the following diagram.This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the \n",

       ", on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it.These motions, continued farther, would become unintelligibly intricate, for the continuation is boundless, never returning to its previous path.Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram.Moreover, we are forced to ascribe similar spirals to the remaining four planets, and much more complicated ones to Venus, if the earth stands still.Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun's motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun.Nevertheless, both leave the spirals themselves in the heavens.Copernicus, by attributing a single annual motion to the earth, entirely rids all the planets of these extremely intricate spirals, leading the individual planets into their respective orbits7 quite bare and very nearly circular.In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times.Again, however, it was noticed that these loops in each planet's spirals are unequal in different signs of the zodiac, so that in some places the planet would retrogress through a longer arc of the zodiac, at others through a shorter, and now for a longer, now for a shorter time.Nor is the increment of brightness of a retrograde planet always the same.Because, if one were to compute the times and distances between the midpoints of the retrogressions, neither times nor arcs would be equal, nor would any of the times answer to its arc in the same proportion.Nevertheless, for each planet there was a certain sign of the zodiac from which, through the semicircle to the opposite sign in either direction, all those things successively increased.From these observations it came to be understood that for any planet there are two inequalities mixed together into one, the first of which completes its cycle with the planet's return to the same sign of the zodiac, the other with the sun's return to the planet.Now the causes and measures of these inequalities could not be investigated without separating the mixed inequalities and looking into each one by itself.They therefore thought they should begin with the first inequality, it being more nearly constant and simple, since they saw an example of it in the sun's motion, without the interference of the other inequality.But in order to separate the second inequality from this first one, they could not do anything but consider the planets on those nights at whose beginning they rise while the sun is setting, which thence were called á¼ÎºÏÎ¿Î½ÏÏÎ¯Î¿ÏÏ [acronychal, or  \"night rising\"].For since the presence and conjunction of the sun makes them go faster than usual, and the opposition of the sun has the opposite effect, before and after these points they are surely much removed from the positions they were going to occupy through the action of the first inequality.Therefore, at the very moments of conjunction with and opposition to the sun they are traversing those very positions that are their own.But since they cannot be seen when in conjunction with the sun, only the opposition to the sun remains as suitable for this purpose.But since the sun's mean and apparent motions*  are two different things, for the sun, too, is subject to the first inequality, the question is raised which of these releases the planets from the second inequality, and whether the planets should be considered when at opposition to the sun's apparent position or its mean position.Ptolemy chose the mean motion, thinking that the difference (if any) between taking the mean sun and the apparent sun could not be perceived in the observations, but that the form of computation and of the proofs would become free from difficulty if the sun's mean motion were taken.Copernicus and Tycho followed Ptolemy, carrying over his assumptions.I, as you see in Ch.15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum, instead establish the apparent position, the true body of the sun, as my reference point, and will vindicate that position with proofs in Parts 4 and 5 of this work.But before that, I shall prove in this first part that one who substitutes the sun's apparent for its mean motion establishes a completely different orbit for the planet in the aether, whichever of the more celebrated opinions of the world he follows.Since this proof depends upon the equivalence of hypotheses, we shall begin with this equivalence.Chapter 10Consideration of the observations themselves, with which Tycho Brahe hunted for the moments of opposition to the mean sun.In an enquiry of such precision, I could not have foregone a deeper inspection of the foundations themselves.And Brahe had given me the opportunity to make use of his observations.This is what I found.On \n",

       " since, on that day, the distance of Mars and earth was to the distance of Mars and the sun as 28 is to 60 (given approximately by an anticipatory acquaintance with the hypotheses of Tycho and Copernicus), the ratio of the parallaxes will be the inverse of this, and the maximum  solar parallax will be about 4â 24â.It is set at 3â 0â.But now let us consider that at an altitude of 12Â½Â° Mars would be subject to refraction, if the table of fixed star refractions constructed at Hven is valid for Prague.At this altitude, it was 4â 20â, 2â 18â of which is owed to the latitude, by which Mars is caused to be closer to Arcturus.If, however, we apply the sunâs refraction to Mars (as it often appears we should), it is 8â 45â at this altitude, twice as great.Therefore, the latitudinal parallax would also be twice as great, 4â 36â.In this way, the whole difference which observation imposes upon itself, at these two different moments, would be due entirely to refraction.Reckoning it in the former way would leave a latitudinal parallax of 2â â the difference in parallax in the column whose heading is 5â.This would give the sun only 2â 25â of maximum parallax.So refraction makes our third day, too, suspect and doubtful, and ultimately quite worthless.I know that since Arcturus and Mars are 9 degrees apart,48 which is one third of the amount by which Arcturusâs latitude exceeds Marsâs, it comes out that not all the latitudinal refraction is subtracted from the distances from Mars, and that the parallax changes Marsâs latitude more than it changes this distance from Arcturus.But since this is very small, I have, with greater fear, considered it as something to be left buried.Let him observe it who is versed in more subtle matters.Now on the fourth day, what seems to have been accomplished is nothing other than the total destruction of Marsâs parallax.The meridian distance ought to have been 29Â° 9Â½â with an accurate instrument, and consequently 29Â° 14â with the faulty one.But at the end it was found to be 29Â° 13Â½â, when the latitudinal parallax (had there been any) ought to have been greater, and hence the distance from Arcturus greater.Hence, from that time when Mars attained an altitude of 19Â°, the distance was found to be 29Â° 12Â½â, and one minute greater at the end.This would be a very small parallax.And what is this ratio?When its altitude was 9 degrees (when Hydra was culminating), the distance was 29Â° 9â with a faulty instrument, and still subject to refraction.Later, at an altitude of 25Â° and near the meridian, it was again 29Â° 9â, measured twice at different moments.Could the refraction have been zero initially, that the arc thus remain constant?Or should it rather be said that I (though to myself I might have seemed most diligent) erred in observing?Especially on account of the length of the cylinder.Still, it is at least established by these observations, whatever their quality, that Marsâs parallaxes of latitude are not greater than 4â, which is the amount of uncertainty in the instrument.It is more credible that the parallax is very small.In Ch.64 below, you will find further discussion of this point.That the parallaxes of Mars are greater than the sunâs, on the other hand, is argued by the proportion in the Tychonic and Copernican hypothesis; and from this proportion Marsâs parallax could easily be computed if we were certain of the sunâs parallax.Is, then, the procedure for finding the sunâs altitude and parallax from eclipses uncertain?It is indeed relatively uncertain quantitatively, but as concerns the thing itself it is perfectly certain.The sun is not nearer than 230 semidiameters of the earth, but it is not an infinite number of semidiameters away.But between 700 and 2000 semidiameters (of which the first quantity is from my Mysterium cosmographicum, while the other two are given as the upper and lower limits in observations of eclipses) it does not appear that any indisputable number has yet been demonstrated, as I shall prove in my Hipparchus.Chapter 12Investigation of Marsâs Nodes.Means are not wanting of investigating the planetsâ first inequality through observations, even when these are entangled in the second inequality.Nevertheless, in this second part, I prefer to follow the footsteps of the authorities and make use of acronychal observations, in order to establish my credibility.For I want to be sure that later, when I bring forth something contrary to accepted opinion, no one may complain that I am hiding behind the briar-path of my own method.Furthermore, it is now clear that nothing of any importance is wanting in Marsâs diurnal parallax as taken by Tycho.I shall therefore move on, little by little, towards the reduction of the observed positions of Mars to the point opposite the sunâs apparent position.As a first step, we must find the nodes.Tycho Brahe used to investigate them thus:In the diagram of Ch.9, let A be the position of the node, E the planetâs position on the ecliptic in \n",

       " C the observed sidereal position of the planet, 17Â° 56â 5â Taurus, EC the observed latitude, 0Â° 5â 15â north.Now it is presupposed that the angle EAC is very nearly 4Â° 34Â½â, the same as the maximum northern latitude observed in the same way in 1585.In the right triangle CEA (or the isosceles triangle CBA; the difference is unimportant in this procedure), from side CE and angle EAC he sought the length EA, the distance of the ecliptic position from the node.There is nothing wrong with this operation, since EC is small and nearthe node.However, the need for accuracy1 in this demonstration commends another.For it was said in Ch.9 that the angle EAC is not constant; hence, through different latitudes of different oppositions they will also show different positions for the node.Nor is EAC as great as the maximum apparent latitude, because AC is a curved arc; and neither is it AC, but some path inside (AF, say), that is the planetâs path as it would be seen from the center of the sun.Therefore, A will not necessarily be the node, at least as found through this operation.I, therefore, investigated the nodes differently, using observations on the day on which they were at the node.Even though this method depends upon some preconceptions, and the subject will be treated more accurately below in Part 5, we ought to have a first taste of it here, if only to give confirmation.My presupposition was that when the planet, in its eccentric position, is truly at the node, it can by no disposition of the earth or sun be made to appear elsewhere than at the node.For in the Copernican hypothesis, this in itself is in agreement with the nature of things: that the moving faculty of any star is not bound to observe a star foreign to it (including the earth), but has its own laws governing its circuit.In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, this would be exactly as if one were to say that the epicycle pays heed, not to a line from the sun through its own center, but to certain positions beneath the fixed stars, beneath which  it places the planet in the plane of the ecliptic.In the Tychonic system, the same will be said of the eccentric.Further, that which I presupposed, I have found to be true using the following observations:On \n",

       " it was at 5Â° 31â Taurus.It therefore appears that the diameter of the nodes does not pass through the center of equable motion,16 but far beneath it.For from 5Â° 31â Taurus to 27Â° 14Â½â Scorpio is more than from the latter to the former.If, on the other hand, you make use of the Tychonic equations, 11Â° 17â must be added to the latter figure and 11Â° 30â subtracted from the former.Accordingly, the one comes out to be 15Â° 44Â½â Scorpio, and the other, 16Â° 48â Taurus, which are Marsâs equated eccentric positions ^17.As you see, the nodes are nearly opposite one another at about 16âË Taurus and Scorpio, when viewed from the center of the planetary system, which Ptolemy described as a point very near the earth, and Copernicus and Tycho as a point very near the sun.Further, it will be seen in Part 5 below how much we are going to change these positions of the nodes when we change the equations by transposing the theory of the sun from the sun's mean position to its apparent position.Chapter 13Investigation of the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of the orbit of Mars.In the previous chapter, the nodes and limits have been found quite accurately according to the opinions of Tycho Brahe and myself.Now it is to be inquired what exactly the inclination of the plane of Marsâs orbit is to the plane of the ecliptic.It is not so evident how to deduce this from the observations themselves.For the angle of this inclination is set up around the center of the planetary system, which for Copernicus and Tycho is the sun.But the eye cannot be placed at the sun so that this inclination might thence appear beneath the fixed stars and be measured, and the maximum distance of the limit from the ecliptic, seen from another place, will also be seen under another angle.In the Ptolemaic form there might appear to be a more direct procedure, but this is not so.For it will be demonstrated that the plane of the epicycle always remains parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.Therefore, place the center of the plane of the epicycle at either limit, and let the planet lie on the same line of longitude passing from the center of vision through the center of the epicycle.The planet will then either be more distant than the center of the epicycle from the observer, and thus its distance from the ecliptic will appear less than the distance of the center of the epicycle from the same ecliptic, or it will be nearer to the observer, and will thus appear greater than what we seek.In this difficulty we may take consolation from this one circumstance: that the purpose for which we seek to know the inclination as one of our principles is not such as to require the highest accuracy.It will consequently permit us to use those means which furnish indirect evidence of the quantity of the inclination: we shall offer three of these.Now it is apparent from what has just been said that it will be most directly helpful to us if we find an observation of the star Mars at that moment at which Mars is reported to be equidistant from the sun and the earth and on the line drawn from the sun to 16Â° or 17Â° Leo or Aquarius (the positions of the limits).In the Ptolemaic form, this is where the center of the epicycle is at 16Â° or 17Â° Leo or Aquarius and Mars is as far from the earth as is the center of the epicycle.In Mercury alone this problem does not occur.Let B be the sun, A the earth, and upon AB let the isosceles triangle ABC be set up, with C the planetâs position in the plane of the ecliptic; and, CE being drawn perpendicular to the orbit of Mars, let the body of Mars be at E. EC will therefore appear the same whether seen from B the sun or A the earth âthis is immediately evident.But in order that it be known at what position Mars is equidistant from the sun and the earth, observe that when the lines from Mars at C and the earth at A falling upon the sun at B make the angle CBA right, then CB is shorter than CA.Consequently, BA, the position opposite the sunâs, should make with BC, the eccentric position of Mars, an angle less than 90Â°, in order that CAB and CBA be equal.Therefore, if BC is directed toward 17 Leo, the sun ought to be beyond 17 Taurus and before 17 Scorpio.Or if on the contrary BC is directed toward 17 Aquarius, the sun should be beyond 17 Scorpio and before 17 Taurus.We use these circumlocutions to denote morning  risings or evening settings, with Mars and the sun sextile or quintile ^1.In the Ptolemaic form, if C be the earth, A the center of the epicycle, and B Mars, CAB will not be able to be right, as CA and CB are to be made equal.So the anomaly of commutation2 ought to be more than 90Â° or less than 270Â°.If you wish to work a little more precisely, take from Copernicus or from an anticipation of Tychoâs reformation the approximate ratio \n",

       " the sun was at 16Â° Taurus, and Mars was observed at 21Â° 26â Leo, with latitude 1Â° 49Â¾â.Therefore, the inclination at the eccentric motion of 21Â° 26â Leo is 1Â° 49Â¾â.And since 21Â° 26â Leo is 5Â° from the limit, and the sine of 85Â° is 1/250 less than the whole sine,21 the maximum inclination here will be greater by 1/250 of it, that is, about 1Â° 50Â½â.In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, the demonstration of this theorem proceeds  on the following basis.Let A be the earth, AB the line through the sun and the point opposite, at 17Â° Taurus or Scorpio, AD Marsâs line of vision, D Mars, and BAD a right angle.AD will accordingly be at 17Â° Leo or Aquarius.And because D is Mars, a line drawn from D parallel to BA will pass through the center of the epicycle C (since the motion of Mars on its epicycle follows the motion of the sun in its orb).Take a point E on AD such that AE equals AC.Therefore, since AC will not be at 17Â° Leo or Aquarius, it will not be so far from the ecliptic as the northern limit E. D will likewise not stand so far from the ecliptic as E, because CD and all the points of the epicycle are equally distant from the ecliptic, since the plane of the epicycle, in order to make the hypothesis equivalent, is supposed always to remain parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.But proportionally as D or C is less distant from the ecliptic than E, D is closer to A than E, with the result that the distance D may be seen from A as proportionally greater, and both may be seen under the same angle from A. Now, according to spherical trigonometry, as the distance of C from the ecliptic is to the distance of E from the ecliptic, so is the sine of arc CB (that is, AD) to the whole sine AE, because ECB is a circle inclined above AB.But C and D are equally distant from the ecliptic, as was just said.Therefore, AD is to AE as the distance of D (or the perpendicular drawn from D to the ecliptic) is to the perpendicular from E. Therefore, the triangles ADD and AEE will be similar, since they have right angles at points D and E on the ecliptic, and the sides are proportional.Also, they will be concurrent, since the sides (AD, AE) are drawn in the plane of the ecliptic through the same point A, and are directed toward the same point of longitude, 17Â° Leo or Aquarius.Therefore, the lines AD, AE in the orbit are also concurrent; that is, the line extended from the earth A through Mars D at this position will hit upon E, the center of the epicycle, when it is at the limit.Thus the angles of maximum inclination and of observed latitude of Mars will be the same at this place.A third way depends upon computation and upon prior knowledge of the ratio of the orbs.We shall have a taste of this one only for the sake of confirmation.A true and accurate treatment is reserved for Part V and ch.63, and is not required here.In Tychoâs table of oppositions, the apparent latitude at 21Â° 16â Leo was 4Â° 32ââ22Let A be the sun, B the earth, C Mars on the eccentric.Thus the line AE running out through the earth B among the fixed stars will intersect the ecliptic, and AC will intersect the orbit of Mars.And since Mars is at 21Â° Leo, near the limit, the angle EAC is near its maximum.I track this down as follows.Let BA be \n",

       ", from our prior knowledge.As CA is to the sine of CBE, BA is to the sine of BCA, 4Â° 21â 10â.Subtracting from CBE, this leaves the required angle BAC, 1Â° 41â 50â.However, this position is about 26Â° from the limit, 64Â° from the node.So, as the sine of 64Â° is to this digression from the ecliptic of 1Â° 42â, so is the whole sine to the maximum inclination of the planes, which comes out to be 1Â° 53â.We need not be concerned about the three minutesâ excess, for they arise from the assumed ratio, for which see Part IV below.In the Ptolemaic form, A will be the earth, C the center of Marsâs epicycle, and D the lowest point on the epicycle, since Mars is situated at opposition to the sun.And because the sunâs line EA is on the ecliptic, while the plane of the epicycle is set up parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, CD will be parallel to EA.Therefore, BAC and ACD, the inclinations of the eccentric and the epicycle, are equal.But, owing to the full equivalence of the hypotheses, CD is equal to BA; that is, as AB is to AC in Copernicus, so is the semidiameter of the Ptolemaic epicycle DC to CA, the line from the earth to the center of the epicycle.Therefore, CDA and CBA are equal, and EBC and BAD are equal: the apparent latitude.Chapter 14The planes of the eccentrics are non-liberating ^1.The convolutions of Ptolemyâs hypothesis forced him to accumulate many monstrosities in the theory of latitudes.For when he decided to make the plane of the epicycle tip every which way (it not being immediately clear, through the mists of his hypothesis, that the plane of the epicycle is parallel to the plane of the ecliptic), he contrived the latitude from three components, and in order that contraries counterbalance one another,*  utterly wrenched his epicycle from its parallel position.He did not choose to find average values, whether on the grounds that his observations were not closely spaced, or that he distrusted those that were so, and hence accepted extreme values which were in error.As a consequence, you may see that in the usual computation (e.g., in Maginiâs Ephemerides) there is no conjunction whatever of Mars and the sun that is not,  as they say, âthrough the bodyâ.If this were true, it would been in vain that nature devised latitudinal temperings, which prevent the excessive arousal of the sublunar powers that often repeated physical conjunctions would cause.Copernicus, ignorant of his own riches, ever took it upon himself to express Ptolemy, not the nature of things, to which, nonetheless, he of all men came closest.(In this regard, see Rheticusâs Narratio prima.)For although he rejoiced to find that when the earth approaches a celestial body, the apparent latitudes are increased, he still did not dare to reject the remaining Ptolemaic increases in the latitudes (which this approach of the earth would not bring about).Instead, in order to reproduce these as well, he fabricated librations of the planes of the eccentrics, in which the angle of inclination (which for  Ptolemy was fixed) would be varied.Moreover, in a manner close to being monstrous, this happens not according to the laws of motion2 of its own eccentric, but to those of the earthâs orb, clearly foreign.See Copernicus Book VI Ch.1.Armed by my own skepticism, I always opposed this gratuitous connection of diverse orbs as a cause of motion, even before seeing Tychoâs observations.In this I more greatly congratulate myself that the observations were found to stand in agreement with me, as has happened with many other preconceived opinions.But lest anyone deem me untrustworthy on this very account, claiming that I would treat the observations with prejudice, let him now witness that Ihave most solidly demonstrated that there are no liberations in the inclination of the eccentric.For three ways of investigating the maximum inclination were proposed.In the first, the sun was near Marsâs sextiles and quintiles,3 that is, about as close to Marsâs conjunction as it could be and still allow Mars to be conveniently seen and observed.In the second, it was near quadrature with Mars, and in the third it was right opposite Mars.But when the sun was at all three places, Mars exhibited one and the same maximum inclination (1Â° 50â, about), northwards, at the same place on its eccentric, and the same amount southwards at the opposite position.Likewise, in \n",

       " it appeared that when Mars was near the nodes of its motion on the eccentric, no matter what position the sun occupied on its orb (whether near Mars or far from it), Mars was never seen to have any latitude.And in the fifth part below it will be proved in many ways that the declination of Marsâs orbit from the ecliptic is constant at any particular position on its orbit.And so let us conclude with great certainty that the inclination of the planes of the eccentrics to the ecliptic does not vary at all.(For why should I not form a general conclusion, seeing that there is no reason why it should exist in only a single planet?Even so, I have demonstrated the same for both Venus and Mercury from the observations.)And a follower of Ptolemy may learn from this that the plane of the epicycle is always parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.For this is already demonstrated where the center is near the limits, and it was proved above in Ch.12 that when the center is near the nodes, the epicycle lies entirely on the ecliptic.Now who will set me up a fountain of tears, by which, for his deserts, I might bewail the pathetic industry of Apianus, who in his Opus Caesarium,4  following his trust in Ptolemy, spent so many hours and wasted so many ingenious meditations trying to express, by means of spirals and corollae and helices and volutes and a vast labyrinth of the most intricate curves, a human figment which the nature of things clearly disowns?But that man shows us that he was easily capable of equaling nature by the divine talents of his most perspicacious wits.Apart from this, he entertained his mind with these tricks (in which he rivaled nature herself), which were thoroughly mastered and assembled in his models, and he has consequently won the prize of undying fame,5 whatever diminishment fortune herself might have in store for the works themselves.But what are we to say of the empty artistry6 of those who made the devices?7 For they make six hundred, nay rather twelve hundred little wheels, so they can triumph in the presentation of the latitudes (that is, human figments thereof) in their works, and claim the consequent reward.Chapter 15Reduction of observed positions at either end of the night to the fine of the sunâs apparent motion1Now, with that investigation carried through to its conclusion, and the positions of the nodes, the inclination of the planes, and its constancy all demonstrated, all of which were necessary for the coming reduction, we shall now define the positions which a planet may occupy on its orbit when the sun itself is diametrically opposite it.The \n",

       " in the morning.Marsâs position was 18Â° 37â 50â Libra.For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Marsâs position 18Â° 37â 10â Libra.The latitude was slightly greater than 2Â° 25â, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2Â° 22â north.Now these twelve eccentric positions of Mars (so called because the  longitudes are freed from the effects of the second inequality) have been established with all possible care.If in this prickly business something has escaped me somewhere (and it did escape sometimes for a period of as much as eighteen months: I relied upon a false foundationâfalse, that is, for the applied observationâand all that work was in vain), I am entirely at a loss to imagine what it could be.I shall therefore set out all the positions in the following table, with the addition of the mean longitudes from Tycho.I could have gotten these from the Prutenic tables, or from the computation upon which Ptolemy based his demonstrations and which he designed for that purpose, but this would be unnecessary.For if the mean motion needed correction, it will be corrected later.For the present, it will serve to measure the time intervals without any appreciable error.36Chapter 16A method of finding a hypothesis to account for the first</br>inequality.Ptolemy, in Book 9 chapter 41 of the Great Work, where he is about to take up the first inequality, made by way of preface a somewhat cursory declaration of the suppositions of which he wished to make use.It is, in summary, as follows: We see that a planet spends unequal times on opposite semicircles.As, although from 2âÂ° Cancer through Leo to 26Â¾Â° Sagittarius is less than a semicircle, and from 26Â° Sagittarius through Aquarius to Cancer is more than a semicircle, nonetheless the planet is found to spend longer on the former than on the latter, although a law of uniformity2 would require the contrary.For from a mean longitude of 2s 23Â° 18â to 9s 5Â° 44â is 6s 12Â° 26â, more than a  semicircle, that is, more than half of the planetâs periodic time ^3.So from 12Â° 16â Pisces through Leo to 12Â° 27â Virgo is about a semicircle and 11 minutes.But if the mean longitude of the former position (11s 9Â° 55â) be subtracted from the longitude of the latter (5s 14Â° 59â), the difference is seen to be 6s 5Â° 5â, which is 5Â° 5â more than half.The planet consequently takes a proportionally shorter time from Virgo through Aquarius to Pisces.Now if you examine adjacent positions one at a time and compare the intervening arcs with the times or with the arcs of mean longitude, you will see that the planet is slowest at one fixed point on the zodiac, and swiftest at the opposite point, and that at the intermediate points its motion gradually increases or decreases, according to its proximity to one or the other.These things reveal first of all that the motion of a planet (however irregular it may appear) is governed according to cycles, and that the present cycle is the successive modification of motion and a return to its same state.For if the planet moved in straight lines joined by angles (such as if it should move around a pentangleâI was once engaged in such ideas), its motion would sometimes suddenly change from swifter to slower in an evident manner, according to the relationship of the lines, and this would happen not in one but in many places on the zodiac, according to the number of lines.However, since so great an inequality still remains in the planetâs motion, after the removal of the inequality that depends upon the sun, it therefore will be incapable of being either governed or demonstrated by the supposition of a simple circle (one set up at the center of observation).This can, however, be done by composition of several circles, or the equivalent (as Ptolemy said in his preliminaries to Book 3).The simplest ways of doing this are two: by using either an eccentric circle or a concentric with an epicycle.Thus Ptolemy chooses an eccentric for the first inequality, for the sake of distinguishing between the two and providing an aid to comprehension, since an epicycle would be required for the second inequality.Then, thinking over this general description, he denies that a mere eccentric suffices the planets.For he first considered closely what would duly follow from the simultaneous revolution of an epicycle (to account for the second inequality) and an eccentric (for the first inequality), and it was then evident, by comparing observations, that the center of the epicycle approaches much nearer to the earth at apogee, and flees farther from it at perigee, than the simple eccentric that accounts for the first inequality allows.From this discovery, by a continuous train of thought, he alights on the measure of this approach, and relates that he discovered that the center of the eccentric that carries the center of the epicycle is exactly at the midpoint between the center of observation, the earth, and the center of uniformity or of the eccentric accounting for the first inequality.And, without a single demonstration, he nevertheless relies upon this principle for the three superior planets.Copernicus, as he frequently did on other occasions, here too followed his master  religiously, his form of hypothesis being accommodated to this measure.Not without reason, astronomers have wondered about this, and I among them (using Maestlinâs voice), as you see in the Mysterium cosmographicum Ch.22 p.79.Despite my having opined, in that passage of the said book, that Ptolemy used blind guesswork to establish this, the truth is the opposite.For he was able to prove it with a perfectly good demonstration given a suitable  observation, as I shall demonstrate below.One finds fault with the theorist only in that he did not transmit to posterity those observations along with the demonstration.And so, since I thought then that this was altogether too much to assume,4 and also saw it pointedly called into question by Copernicus when he argued for a change in Marsâs eccentricity on the basis of his figures which were not in accord with this bisection of the eccentricity, I envisaged a method which would lead me to a knowledge of the ratio of the two eccentricities (because, as I said, it is not indubitably 2:1).And since Ptolemy used three acronychal5 observations and this preconceived opinion of the ratio of the eccentricities to find the position of the apogee, the correction of the mean longitude, and finally, the magnitude of the eccentricity, I saw that in order to weaken the sinews of the problem (once the axiom of the ratio of the eccentricity is taken away), it will be indeterminate and not having a single case, and thus I would need in addition the support of a fourth acronychal observation.And so, in the year 1600, having acquired knowledge of this art, I came to Tycho, and was happy to learn that he too did not assume this ratio, but made an investigation, as his figures indicate.For he makes the center of the (Copernican*)  eccentric distant from the center of vision by \n",

Now let F, G, D, and E be four observations distributed about the circumference of the circle, so situated that the planet, stripped of the second inequality, would appear there as if  viewed from point A. For indeed, according to Ptolemy, A is the true center of vision or the center of the earth, while according to Tycho and Copernicus vision takes place along the lines FA, GA, DA, and EA, and A is the sun ^7.But it was said above that in either way the planet is likewise shorn of its second inequality.Now let each point be connected with each of the others, and let AF be at 25Â° 43â Virgo, AG at 26Â° 43â Sagittarius, AD at 12Â° 16â Pisces, and AE at 17Â° 31ââ Taurus.Hence, the four angles about A are given: FAG is 91Â° 0â, GAD is 75Â° 33â, DAE is 65Â° 15ââ, and EAF is 128Â° 11ââ.These must be corrected somewhat on account of the precession of the equinoxes.For in relation to the fixed stars the planet is not so far forward at E (the last observation) as is indicated by these numbers.Wherefore FAE is a little greater, and the others smaller by the same amount.In the same way, by subtraction of the [mean] longitudes, the angles about C are also obtained.Proposition.It is now required to select values for angles FAH and FCH such that, once these are supposed, the points F, G, D, E stand on one circle, and that center B of that circle lie between the points C and A on the line CA.The solution is not geometrical, at least if algebra is not geometrical, but proceeds by a double iteration ^8.For algebra, too, forsakes us here, because terms communicated by strictly straight lines through straight line do not extend to angles,9 unless perchance one would wish to cram the entire theory of sines into this one operation.But behold what we are required to do.If we were to assume a value for the angle FAH, then since the line AF has a certain sidereal position, the other leg AH would also be assumed to have a certain sidereal position.But let AH be the line of the apogee, or the line of the aphelion in the Copernican and Tychonic notion.We are thus required to assume and posit that which is sought.For it was in order to learn the position of this aphelion that we embarked upon this path.In the same way, since the sidereal position of AH (that is, CH) was arrived at through this assumption of ours, and it passes through C the center of our equant circle (and therefore also through the starting point from which the numbering of its parts has its beginning, namely, the apsis which is conceived as being above H); and since we are also required to assume the angle FCH, the line CF therefore also will acquire its position on the circumference of the equant.And indeed, this is the mean longitude corresponding to the observed position of the planet at F. And we were seeking to know what this mean longitude is.Therefore, in addition to the apogee, we are assuming yet another thing among those which we were seeking.At the same time, however, it is not unusual, whether in geometry, or arithmetic, or dialectic, to use a form of argument which leads to an impossibility, so that if something absurd is seen to follow from the assumptions, they are rejected as false; and this is carried out until the consequent removal of excesses and defects unveils the exact truth (which in the mathematical disciplines lies hidden in the middle between the two).In the present case this comes about in the following manner.Let the line CA be taken as the nominal standard (and thus, let it be given).Since the angles FCH and FAH are assumed, and hence also the inclinations of the remaining lines to HCA, and AC is the common side of the four triangles CFA, CGA, CDA, CEA, whose angle are given, therefore the four lines AF, AG, AD, and AE will be given in relation to the length AC.And since in the four new triangles FAG, GAD, DAE, and EAF, the sides are already given with the angles at A between two sides,  the individual angles at the bases of the several triangles (that is, AFG, ADG, ADE, and AFE), will not be a matter of ignorance.But AFG and AFE are parts of the angle GFE.And in the quadrilateral DEFG (if, indeed, it is inscribed in a circle, which is one of the hypotheses here), it is a consequence that two opposite angles (as GFE, GDE) taken together are equal to the sum of two right angles.Therefore, when the four angles which we have just found are combined, if their sum differs from the measure of two right angles, we shall pronounce the assumptions false, whether the falsehood be in one or the other of the assumed values, or both.Then, one angle, FCH, being kept the same, and the other, FAH, being changed,10 a return will be made to the beginning, and the sum of the four angles will once more sought.If this sum differs more than the previous sum from two right angles, it suggests that FAH was altered in the wrong direction.Therefore, the opposite must be done: if you had added something to it, you now would diminish it, or vice versa.But if, on the other hand, you have come closer to the correct measure, then you will be sure that you are on the way.And then by comparing the original discrepancy with that which still remains, you will carry on in that same proportion by increasing or decreasing the angle FAH.But it is still not certain that this second correction will directly reconcile your four angles with the exact measure.For the rate of increase of circular variables is not the same as that of straight ones.Your labor will have to be repeated again and again, until your sum for the angles in question is 180Â° or very nearly as much (you may safely ignore very small discrepancies).When you have carried this out until the angles F and D (and therefore the remaining angles G and E) truly stand upon the same circumference, now, in turn, an enquiry must be made into the other matter that it is fitting to pursue, and that is, whether the center of that circle B lies between C and A on the same line.For on this point it was said above that Ptolemy assumed it outright, and physical considerations demand that the slowest motion occur where the star is at its greatest distance from A, the sun, as at H. This can happen in no other way than if A, B, and C are on the same line.To find this out, let the known angles GAD, DAE, be taken as one, so that the angle GAE may be known, and in GAE from this angle and sides GA, AE, let the side GE be sought.Now in the triangle GFE the angle GFE stands upon the circumference.Therefore, GBE, the angle at the center, is its double.But the angle GFE was previously found through its parts GFA, AFE.So, again, in the isosceles triangle GBE the angle GBE and the side GE are given.Consequently, the angles at the base will not be unknown, as well as GB the radius of the circle, in proportion to AC, the eccentricity taken at the beginning.And because BG and BGE are now had, and AG and AGE were had before, therefore, by subtracting AGE from BGE (or vice versa, as the case requires), the remainder will be AGB.Next, in triangle AGB, AG, BG, and the included angle AGB are given.[Hence, the other sides and angles will not be unknown, and thus the angle BAG will be given] ^11.If this differs from CAG, which was taken at the beginning, it shows that B itself, contrary to what should happen, does falls outside the line CA.So again we shall pronounce the assumed magnitudes of angles FCH and FAH to be false.But if we keep FCH fixed and change FAH we fall into yet another absurdity, namely, that the positions D, E, F, G, do not fall upon  a circle (just as they did not above, before we had finally established the magnitude of FAH).Therefore, it is obvious that FCH, too, has to be changed.Let it be changed, then; that is, let another quantity be taken at will for the angle FCH, and keeping that constant, let the angle FAH be adjusted four, five, or six times, until once again the four angles at F and D add up to two right angles.Then let an attempt be made at a second enquiry, using the triangles GAE, GFE, GBE, and BGA, to find BAG, in comparison with CAG as it has now most recently been established.Here you will again see whether you have departed farther from the truth, or have in truth come closer, and according to the qualities of excess or defect and ratios of the additions you will thence return to the beginning until you find BAG equal to the value you had assumed during that trial for CAG or HAG.When you have arrived at this point, then finally, in triangle BGA, you will assign a round number (\n",

       " between 140 and 1587.Therefore, the annual motion is very nearly 13\": 6' 29\" every 30 years.If, in turn, you add to this the Tychonic value for the motion of the fixed stars or of precession, which is quite uniform and is the same for all times (Ptolemy's alone excepted), namely, 25' 30\" in 30 years, you will get the sum of 31' 59\".Therefore, the annual motion of Mars's aphelion with respect to the equinox is 1'4\" in our time.On the motion of the nodesAlthough it is not really necessary, we shall consider this subject here because it is related to the motion of the aphelia.And because Ptolemy says in Book 13 Ch.1 that Mars's northern limit is \"near the end of Cancer, and almost at its apogee,\"2 it will therefore be at 29 Cancer, that is, 3Â½Â° before Cor Leonis.Despite this, in book 3 Ch.6 Ptolemy put the northern limit exactly at the position of the apogee (25Â½Â° Cancer) because it made calculations easier.And today it is at about 16Â° 20' Leo, about 7Â° 45' before Cor Leonis.By subtraction of 3Â° 30', the northern limit, and consequently the nodes, are found to have retrogressed 4Â° 15' from Cor Leonis.This accords well with the motions of the moon, whose apogee likewise has a progressive motion with respect to the fixed stars, while its nodes retrogress.So the annual westward motion is 10\" 34'\", or 5' 17\" in 30 years.Subtract this from the motion of precession, 25' 30\".The remainder is 20' 13\".And the nodes of Mars are moved the same number of minutes with respect to the equinoctial point in 30 of our present years, likewise eastward.Chapter 18Examination of the twelve acronychal positions using the hypothesis we have found.I shall use that form1 of calculation which I explained above in Chapter 4,  because it is more succinct.Also, it is indubitable that not a minute and a half (actually somewhat less) would be gained or lost by using the Copernican or Tychonic form, as I noted in the same place.You see, then, O studious reader, that the hypothesis found by the method developed above, is able in its calculations not only to account, in turn, for the four observations upon which it was founded, but also to comprehend all the other observations within two minutesâa magnitude which this star, when in its acronychal position, always fills and even exceeds in the size of its body ^2.This shows that if anyone were to repeat the above method, taking in turn  various sets of four observations, the same eccentricity with the same division, an identical aphelion, and very nearly the same mean motion, would always result.I therefore proclaim that the acronychal positions displayed by this calculation are as certain as the observations made with the Tychonic sextants can be.As I have said before, these observations are subject to some degree of uncertainty (at least two minutes), owing to Mars's small but appreciable diameter, and refraction and parallax, which are not yet known with complete certainty ^3.Finally, you see how nothing prevented the transposition of acronychal observations from the mean to the apparent motion of the sun, so as to keep me from, not just imitating, but even surpassing, the certitude of the Tychonic calculation, which was raised as an objection against my abandoning the sun's mean motion.4 5Chapter 19A refutation, using acronychal latitudes, of this hypothesis constructed according to the opinion of the authorities and confirmed by all the acronychal positions.Who would have thought it possible?This hypothesis, so closely in agreement with the acronychal1 observations, is nonetheless false, whether the observations be considered in relation to the sun's mean position or to its apparent position.Ptolemy indicated this to us when he teaches that the eccentricity of the equalizing point is to be bisected by the center of the eccentric bearing the planet.For here neither Tycho Brahe nor I have bisected the eccentricity  of the equalizing point.Now for Copernicus* it was a matter of religion not to neglect this anywhere.For he made very little use of observations, perhaps thinking that Ptolemy used no more than are referred to in his Great Work.Tycho Brahe balked at this.For in imitating Copernicus, he set up this ratio of the eccentricities, which the acronychal observations required.But when this was gainsaid not only by the acronychal2 latitudes (for these still underwent some increase arising from the second inequality) but also, and much more forcefully, by observations of other positions with respect to the sun which are affected by the second inequality, he stopped here and turned to the lunar theory, and I meanwhile stepped in.Now the method by which the whole theory of Mars could easily be acquitted of error, if the premises were correct, and by which it is demonstrated to be incorrect, is this.First, through the latitudes at acronychal positions.In the Copernican form, let the line DE be set out in the plane of Mars's eccentric, upon which let A be the sun, D the northern limit, E the southern limit, or the point nearest it.And through A  let the straight line HL be drawn, lying in the plane of the earth's eccentric orb.Now let AH and AD be conceived as lying in the one plane of a circle of latitude, and likewise AL and AE.And let the earth \n",

Therefore, the inclination FDA will be equal to the inclination BAD, and the line of vision AF will be parallel to the original line BD.Therefore, the observed latitude, HAF and HBD, is the same.The same must be said of the congruent triangles ACE and EGA.And thus the demonstration and the magnitudes of the corresponding lines are the same.It will occur to the reader to question why I make the semidiameter of Mars's epicycle unequal to itself, namely, DF equal to BA, which is longer, and EG equal to CA, which is shorter.I answer from Part I, that this happens because of the transposition of observations from opposition to the sun's mean position to opposition to the sun's apparent position.If we should stay with the sun's mean motionâand the present line of argument prevails even thenâDF and EG will remain equal at least up to this point.But for this see Part I Ch.6.For the Brahean form, leaving one of the triangles (DBA, say) the same, so that B may be the motionless earth and A the sun in 1585, let AB be extended so that BH is equal to AC, and let H be the sun in 1593, at 12Â° Virgo, and let HI be made equal and parallel to AE in the same direction, so that Mars at perigee is at I, and at apogee at D; HBA the ecliptic, BHI, BAD the inclination; IBA the latitude at perigee, and DBH at apogee.So again the sum of DA and HI will come out the same, whose half is DK, and the eccentricity will be KA.The only difference is this, that for Ptolemy  the plane of the epicycle, and for Tycho the plane of the eccentric, is moved from north to south and back, remaining parallel to itself, while in Copernicus both stay in the same place.Meanwhile, consider this also.In chapter 16 I had found the combined eccentricity to be \n",

       " whose arc is 82Â° 44' 20\".This, subtracted from the 83Â° 57' 46\" found earlier, leaves 1Â° 13' 26\", which is the other part of the equation.If this be added to the semi-equated anomaly, and the sum be added to the aphelion, it puts the planet at 12Â° 13' 37\" Pisces, which differs from the former hypothesis by three minutes, and is more distant from the observed position.For it should have been 12Â° 16' Pisces.This appears more clearly at 17Â° Cancer in 1582.For with the eccentricity bisected, Mars falls at 17Â° 4Â¾â Cancer, and this calculated value differs from ours by 7ââ at about 45Â° from aphelion, but by about 9' from the observation.And from this difference of eight minutes, so small as it is, the reason is clear why Ptolemy, when he made use of bisection, was satisfied with a fixed equalizing point.For if the eccentricity of the equant, whose magnitude the very large equations in the middle longitudes fix indubitably, be bisected, you see that the very greatest error from the observations reaches 8', and this in Mars,  which has the greatest eccentricity; it is therefore less for the rest.Now Ptolemy professes not to go below 10', or the sixth part of a degree, in his observation.The uncertainty or (as they say) the \"latitude\" of the observations therefore exceeds the error in this Ptolemaic computation.Since the divine benevolence has vouchsafed us Tycho Brahe, a most diligent observer, from whose observations the 8' error of this Ptolemaic computation is shown in Mars, it is fitting that we with thankful mind both acknowledge and honor this favor of God.For it is in this that we shall carry on, to find at length the true form of the celestial motions, supported as we are by these proofs showing our suppositions to be fallacious.In what follows, I shall myself, to the best of my ability, lead the way for others on this road.For if I had thought I could ignore eight minutes of longitude, in bisecting the eccentricity I would already have made enough of a correction in the hypothesis found in  Ch.16.Now, because they could not be ignored, these eight minutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of astronomy, and have become the material for a great part of the present work.Chapter 2On the first and simple equivalence, that of the eccentric and the concentric with an epicycle, and their physical causes.And now, to begin, I take up the equivalence of hypotheses adopted to save [the appearances of] the first inequality,1 which were demonstrated by Ptolemy in Book III and by Copernicus in Book III Ch.15.There, an eccentric is shown to square accounts with an epicycle on a concentric, provided, that is, that the line of apsides in the eccentric and the line through the center of the epicycle and the planet on the concentric always remain parallel, and that the semidiameter of the epicycle in the latter is equal to the eccentricity in the former, while the semidiameters of eccentric and concentric are equal.And also provided that, in the former, the planet is moved uniformly on its eccentric, so as to traverse equal arcs in equal times.First, let A be the position of the observer and the center of the concentric BB on which is the epicycle BC, BE.Let the arcs between two B's, or the angles BAB, be equal, and the planet be first at C, then at E and G, with the lines BE, BG parallel to BC.Next, let Î² be the center of the eccentric Î³Î¶, with Î²Î³, Î²Îµ equal to AB, and let Î± be the point at which the observer is, and Î²Î± (the eccentricity) be equal to the semidiameter of the epicycle BC, BE, and parallel to them.Also, let the arcs Î³Îµ, Î³Î¶, that is, the angles Î³Î²Îµ Î³Î²Î¶, be equal both among themselves and to the former angles BAB.I say that the distances AC, Î±Î³, are equal, and likewise AE to Î±Îµ, AG to Î±Î·, AD to Î±Î´, AH to Î±Î¸, and AF to Î±Î¶; and again, that the angles EAC, ÎµÎ±Î³ are equal; and that in each instance the planet, although its motion is uniform, will appear from A, Î± slow at C, Î³, and swift at D, Î´. As I said, Ptolemy demonstrated this in Book III, so there is no need for further discussion.To geometers, the diagram speaks for itself, and others may go to Ptolemy.As for the physical accounts of these models, there is a greater difference between the two.That this may be very clear, it must be researched at somewhat greater depth, in one way from Peurbach2 using Aristotle's principles, and in another way from Tycho.Ptolemy has described these circles to us in their bare form, such as geometry applied to the observations shows.Peurbach set up a way for them to be traversed that follows Aristotle, who attempted this same thing upon the geometrical suppositions of Eudoxus and Calippus, by which they had treated their astronomy.And while these authors used 25 orbs to demonstrate all the inequalities of the planets, Aristotle (since he believed the heavens to be filled with solid orbs)3 thought that 24 other revolving orbs had to be interposed in order to free each lower orb from the revolving effect which, on account of the contiguity of surfaces, it was going to receive from the orb above it.So, having thus accumulated 49 orbs in all (or 53 or 55, following Calippus), he attributed to each its own mover.Any one of these would be responsible for the perfectly uniform motion of its own orb and all inferior ones which it encompassed.This motion would take place inside the closest surrounding superior orb, as if in a sort of place,4 and from the mover would proceed a constant determination [ratio] of both the direction in which the motion was to occur, and the swiftness with which the orb was to return to its starting position.Moreover, since that philosopher held the motion to be eternal, he also stipulated that the movers  were eternal.Since they created motion for an infinite time, and since Aristotle knew that nothing material could receive the form of infinity, he maintained that they are also immaterial, and separable principles, and consequently immobile.Also, since he had constructed the world's eternity from the eternity of motion, and this duration of essence, the goodness and perfection of the whole world, was opposed to destruction, which was bad, he therefore attributed to those principles the highest perfection and the understanding thereof, and from good understanding the will to see it accomplished, lest the good not be done well.In this way, he introduced to us separate minds which, it turned out, were gods, as the perpetual administrators of the heavens' motions.They also bestowed a moving soul [anima motrix], more closely attached to the orbs and giving them form, so that the mind would only have to give assistance.This was either because it seemed necessary that the mover and the moving thing have some common ground, or because the potentiality, considered in relation to the distance to be traversed, should not be infinite, just as there exists no infinite motion, but only motion through a certain space in a certain time.They therefore transferred this potentiality for creating motion to a soul, for the meantime becoming subject to matter for the purpose of inhering in the orbs of the heavens.Now this coupling of mind and soul is indeed quite in agreement with the detailed considerations of the astronomers, even though the philosophers' mode of argument is chiefly metaphysical.For it is the same in humans: the moving faculty is one thing; that which makes use of the moving faculty according to the indications of the sensesâthe Willâis another.The senses differ from the moving faculty both in the means they use and in the excellence of their structure, which in the organs of sense is more admirable than in the seats of the motive faculty.Similarly, if we should propose these Aristotelian orbs as objects of contemplation, two things will present themselves to us: 1) the motive force, sufficient for the round orb, from whose activity and constant strength the time of revolution arises; 2) the direction in which it acts.The former is more correctly ascribed to the animate faculty, and the latter to its intelligent or remembering nature.Now although through this solidity of orbs all motions or celestial appearances are so provided for that nothing is left to the providence of the presiding movers, while the whole variety of motions is a consequence of the number and disposition of the orbs; an although nothing else is required but that the moving souls receive and retain their activity and be set going from the first moment of creation in whatever direction is theirs, sent forth from their prisons, as it were, into space;5 nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that there is need of the supreme mind to launch any of the planets in its own direction, as if into its fixed and proper province.Aristotle, who knew nothing of the world's beginning and did notbelieve in it, of necessity ascribed this function instead to the governors of the motions.The followers of Aristotle, and even Scaliger,6 who professes to be a Christian, openly contend that this motion of the orbs is voluntary, and that the principle of volition for them is intellectual intuition and desire.So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet.Then they attributed two moving souls to these two orbs (if they should carry through with their physical considerations), both with the same amount of power, proportionally, so that they would complete their periods in the same time, although moving in opposite directions.The other model requires two deferents (which remain motionless so long as we abide by the simplicity of the motions, mentally removing the progression of the apogees), and one orb with the thickness of the planetary body.In this orb is a soul which drives it around with a uniform effort in that direction in which it was projected in the beginning.Thus, if this solidity of the orbs and the other assumptions be granted, in the first model BC and BE will remain parallel, and in the second, the orb Î³Îµ will go around the center Î², even though the movers in the former pay no attention to AC, nor in the latter, to Î². For they are governed by material necessity or by the arrangement and contiguity of the orbs.But, with arguments of the greatest certainty, Tycho Brahe has demolished the solidity of the orbs, which hitherto was able to serve these moving souls, blind as they were, as walking sticks for finding their appointed road; and hence the planets complete their courses in the pure aether, just like birds in the air.Therefore, we shall have to philosophize differently about: these models.Let it then be assumed among the first: principles, that every force by which motions of this sort: are administered dwells in the body of the planet itself, and is not: to be sought: outside itNow the planet: must execute a perfect circle in the pure aether by its inherent: force, an epicycle in the first model and an eccentric in the second.It is therefore clear that the mover will to have two jobs: first, it must have a faculty strong enough to move its body about, and second, it: must have sufficient knowledge to find a circular boundary in the pure aethereal air, which in itself is not divided into such regions.This is the function of mind.Please don't tell me that the motive faculty itself, a scion of a simple and brute soul, has a native altitude for circular motion, exactly like a stone's nature to descend in a straight line.For I deny that God has created any perpetual non-rectilinear motion that is not ruled by a mind.Even in the human body, all the muscles move according to tire principles of rectilinear motions.They either swell by contacting info themselves, or stretch out, the ends moving apart: in the former case, the member approaches the muscle, while in the latter, the member recedes.This same thing takes place in its own way in the circular muscles  that are set up as guards for orifices.When they are extended by the circular filaments, they relax and open the passage, and constrict it when the filaments return into the form of a smaller circle.There is no member whatever that rotates uniformly and without impediment.On the contrary, the bending of the head, feet, arms, and tongue is expressed in certain mechanical devices by many straight muscles carried across or stretched out from one place to another.In this way it is brought about that the motive faculty, which by its own nature tends in a straight line, swings its member in a gyre.Likewise, certain machines raise water to great heights, not because the nature of the body, which conveys the motion, tends to an exalted position, but because, by an arrangement of channels, it is brought about that the water necessarily gives way upwards when a greater weight tends downwards.And even if the motion of certain members were perfectly circular, they7 nonetheless could not be perpetual.There should be no great wonder at this, since in the human body mind presides over the animate faculty.Surely, then, if there had been any way of so constructing some moving faculty that it might be able to rotate some body, it would not have been neglected in the human body.Besides, it is quite impossible for any mind to manifest a circular path without recourse to the guidepost either of a center or of some body which might appear under a greater or smaller angle according to its approach or recession.For a circle is both defined and brought to perfection by the same criterion, namely, equality of distance from the middle.No matter how many of these motive faculties you set up, a circle, even for God, is nothing other than what was just said.Geometers do, of course, show how, given three points on a circumference, to form a continuous circle, but in this very proof it is presupposed that some portion of the circumference (that which passes through the three points) is already constructed.Who, then, will show the planet this starting place, in conformity with which it will make the rest of its path?This is possible in no other way than if the planet's mover (as in Avicenna's opinion) imagine for itself the center of its orb and its distance from it, or if it be assisted by providing some other property of a circle in order to lay out its own circle.We will therefore now form the physical hypothesis of these two models in another way In the latter, simpler one, if our supposition is valid that the mover driving the planet around the path Î³ÎµÎ´ is in the planet itself, there will have to accrue to the planet's mover some sort of awareness of the apparent magnitude of the body at Î± seen (or as if seen) from Î³, Îµ, Î·, Î´. The planet will therefore have to strive both to move forward uniformly (this the undividedand unimpeded forces of the moving soul provide), and to exhibit all the distances Î±Î³, Î±Îµ, Î±Î·, Î±Î´, in such order that they follow by a geometrical law from the eccentric \n",

       " this end, the mover should also know how much longer Î±Î³ is than Î±Î´; that is, by how much the path which it will traverse is eccentric from the body at Î± around which it is to go.The planet's mover will thus be occupied with many things at once.To escape this conclusion, one must assert that the planet pays attention to the point Î², entirely empty of any body orreal quality, and maintains equal distances from that point.The prior model is explained physically thus.Let a motive power beconceived which, seated on the concentric B and itself without body, moves around the body at A with a uniform exertion of forces, maintaining equal distances from that point.Let there be another power in the body of the planet C, capable of holding its attention on the incorporeal power at B, estimating and maintaining its distance from that power, and moving uniformly around it.Thus, as before, this power again will have numerous tasks.But it is also incredible in itself that an immaterial power reside in a non-body, be moved in space and time, but not have a substrate to move itself (as I said) from place to place.And I am making these absurd assumptions in order to establish in the end the impossibility that every cause of a planet's motions inhere in its body or somewhere else in its orb, and to build a path for other less difficult forms of motions that are more readily persuasive.I have presented these models hypothetically, the hypothesis being astronomy's testimony that the planet's path is a perfect eccentric circle such as was described.If astronomy will discover something different, the physical theories will also change.In this equivalence of hypotheses, not only the equality of the apparent angles at A and Î±, but also the actual paths themselves of the planets through the surrounding aether, each remain the same.For in both shape and size, the planet traverses an arc from C to E through angle CAE that is also the same as it traverses from Î³ to Îµ through the equal angle Î³Î±Îµ..Chapter 20Refutation of the same hypothesis through observations in positions other than acronychal.I shall now proceed to the other argument whereby the eccentricity of the eccentric as found in Chapter 161 is proven false, despite its providing true longitudinal motions.This argument is based upon observations of Mars at positions with respect to the sun other than opposition, when the planet was observed in the region of the eccentric's apsides.On \n",

       "), when AC in the greater diagram (BI in the smaller, on the left) is diminished, and along with it AB or GI (the distance at apogee); and, in turn, when AE of the right diagram (and its equal and equivalent DF of the left) is increased, and along with it AD or HF (the distance at perigee).For when the lesser part is increased, and the greater diminished, the difference between the two is decreased.The blame for this discrepancy among the different ways of finding the eccentricity (I am repeating this over and over so that it will be remembered) falls entirely upon the faulty assumptions deliberately entertained by me, in common with Tycho and all who have ever devised hypotheses.For the necessary consequence of this enquiry is that there is no single fixed point on the planet's eccentric about which the planet always sweeps out equal angles in equal times.We would instead have to make such a point reciprocate up and down along the line of apsidesâif, indeed, we could keep the other assumption of a circular orbit.And how such a reciprocation could be reconciled with natural principles, I do not see.But in fact the other assumption will be demolished, in Ch.44 below; that is, the orbit of the star is not a perfect circle, but an oval, and its greatest diameter is the line of apsides, while its least is that passing through the center at the middle elongations.No wonder, then, that the other observations at points not at opposition to the sun do not accord with the hypothesis constructed in Chapter 16, since we have made two false assumptions in it.Chapter 21Why, and to what extent, may a false hypothesis yield the truth?I particularly abhor that axiom of the logicians, that the true follows from the false, because people have used it to go for Copernicus's throat, while I am his disciple in the more general hypotheses concerning the system of the world.I therefore considered it particularly worth while now to show the reader how it does happen here that the true follows from the false.First, you have already seen that what has followed is not completely true.For the path of the planet through the single plane of the ecliptic was considered in two ways: first, in respect to its longitude beneath certain degrees and minutes of the circle of the zodiac, and second, in respect to its altitude or distance from the center of the world about which it moves, which it shows to be different by means of other zodiacal positions.Therefore, our false supposition, although it does put the planet in the right longitudinal position at the right time, does not give it the right altitude.So what follows from this false hypothesis is not completely true.Further, even concerning the longitude alone, the fact that the result appears identical to the senses does not prove that the as yet unknown true hypothesis and the false one assumed by us have an identical result.For there can be a very small discrepancy which the senses do not perceive.There are, however, occasions upon which a false hypothesis can simulate truth, within the limits of observational precision, with respect to the longitude.These I shall now demonstrate.Through the center of the world A let the straight line MP be set out, falling upon opposite parts of the zodiac (29Â°Leo and Aquarius, say).And let it so be that according to some true hypothesis the planet spends half its time between lines AM and AP on the left and the other half on the right, so that after successive halves of its periodic time it is always alternately on the lines AM and AP.And let it be assumed that this particular effect of the true hypothesis is expressible by  some other hypothesis that has been discovered.And so let a circle of any kind or some other curvy line be described about a center taken on the line MP, with the sole provision that it go around the center of the world A and that it be cut into two equal parts by the line MP.What is proposed will happen if the planet traverse the circle with a uniform motion (one which is regular about any one particular point on the line MP, whether fixed or movable); as, for instance, if the circle OP were described about center A and moved uniformly about it.So all these circles and other figures have something in common through which what was proposed occurs, namely, that they move around the center of the world, and move regularly around some point on the line MP.Now the figure, whether this or that circle, whether one or another point of uniform motion, out of all those comprehended under the same genus, can be false.But we have brought about what was proposed, not through this false specific model, but through that which, within this false one, was comprehended within a general truth.Now let us continue, and let it happen that after successive quarter periods the planet lies on the lines AM, AK, AP, AL, the angles MAK, MAL, being less than right angles.Here, then, the former circle OP will be in error at the sides.For since the motion was supposed regular about A, a straight line drawn through A perpendicular to MP (namely, VX) will make the angles MAV, MAX measures of quarter periods.And accordingly, this hypothesis would put the planet on the lines AV, AX, when it should have been on AK, AL.Now experience testifies that the planets' motion closely emulates circularity (although it may perchance not exactly attain it), and it is the nature of motions of this kind to undergo gradual intensification and remission, admitting nothing sudden.Therefore, the error of this hypothesis of the circle OP will begin little by little from the line AM, will grow continually greater, becoming a maximum at AK, and will again gradually decrease and vanish at AP.Therefore, the uniform and concentric hypothesis OP will never be more in error than it is at AK, AL, by the angles KAV, LAX, which, for Mars, are 10Â½Â°.So let there now be another hypothesis which, in addition, also shows us the lines AK, AL.But again, there can be several hypotheses that do this.For we might connect the points where AK and AL intersect the circle OP, and where this straight line intersects the straight line MP we may place the center of uniform motion of the circle OP, so that the motion of the circle OP becomes nonuniform.We would then also have [the planet on] the lines AK, AL [at the appropriate times].But since we have a certain inclination towards choosing the simplest and most regular, we shall therefore seek out that circle that moves uniformly about its own center while effecting for us what is proposed.Therefore, beginning from A, mark off equal lengths AK, AL upon the lines AK, AL; let the points K and L be joined by a straight line intersecting MP at C; and about C with radius CK let the eccentric circle MN be described, whose motion shall be regular about its center.This hypothesis will represent the planet in the correct position, on the four lines AM, AN, AK, AL.But it is not this hypothesis alone, but many others as well, that could have this effect.For they have this feature that is general, and is indeed perfectly true, that the point of uniform motion is on the line that connects the  positions of the planet falling upon the lines AK, AL, and at that point upon it where the line intersects MP.Now it follows from the premises that this hypothesis has absorbed the entire maximum error of the former hypothesis OP, namely, KAV, LAX, at about the quarters of the period, nor does it commit a new error (since at AM, AP it is equivalent to the former).Therefore, if this hypothesis is still in error, that error will be much smaller than KAV.And since it has done its job at CM, CN, CK, CL, the error (if any) will retreat to the four regions intermediate to those just mentioned, and will occur at the eighths of the period, since the time is measured about C. Therefore, angles MCK, KCN being bisected, let two new lines be drawn through C intersecting the circumference at Q, T, R, S. The maximum error, if any, will be about these points.But the hypothesis will also place the planet on the lines AQ, AR, AS, AT, at the eighths of the period.Now suppose (as is true for Mars) that after the eighths of the periodic time the planet should not appear on the lines AQ, AR, AS, AT, but should instead be, for the former two, on the lines AF, AE, higher up, and for latter two on the lines AG, AD, lower down.Therefore, if the former error KAV was 10Â½Â°, the present error QAF will hardly amount to a few minutes.For Mars, the magnitude of QAF or RAE is observed to be about 9â, while SAG or TAD is about 28'.Now as a third step, let this hypothesis too be corrected.As this can happen in a variety of ways (specifically, by a reciprocation of the point C along the line CA), we are not prevented by any scruple from keeping the point of uniform motion C fixed at distance CA, on account of the angle KAV, and also keeping the planet's path circular.These three, taken by choice and not forced by demonstration, will compel us to move the center of the eccentric downwards to B from the point of uniform motion C. Hence, HI is substituted for MN, and the body of the planet departs from the points Q, R, S, T, nevertheless remaining on the lines CQ, CR, CS, CT (because the measure of time stays at C), and arrives at the points marked F, E, G, D. And QF, ER, SG, TD would be such as to make QAF, EAR 9â and SAG, TAD 28'.With this done, that error at the eighths of the period will also be absorbed, and the hypothesis will exhibit the longitude perfectly accurately at eight places.Thus if again some error remains, it will be at the sixteenths of the period, the points in between.Also, since this third eccentric HI is equivalent to the first at positions AM, AP, as well as to the second at the additional positions AK, AL, it introduces no new error.And because the error of the second was greatest at the eighths of the period, and this is now absorbed, at the sixteenths there will therefore be a much smaller error remaining from the old error.Let us estimate it proportionally: just as the error of the first eccentric was 10Â½ Â° while that of the second was 9' or 28', that is, one seventieth or one twenty-fifth of the former, let us now make the errors of the second that many  times the errors of the third.Plainly, already at the sixteenths of the period, we will have driven the business down to within the limits of observational accuracy.It is at least now clear to what extent and in what manner the truth may follow from false principles: whatever is false in these hypotheses is specific to them and can be absent, while whatever endows truth with necessity is in general aspect wholly true and nothing else ^1.Further, as these false principles are fitted only to fixed positions throughout the whole circle, so the truth does not invariably follow outside those very positions, except to the extent that happens in this procedure, that the difference can no longer be appraised by the acuteness of the senses.Also, this same dullness of the senses hides the following additional small error which remains at the eighths of the period.That there is such a remainder I prove thus:Once again, let a perfect eccentric be described about B so that BD, BE, BF, BG are equal, and let us have made BC such that the angle QAF is of the required magnitude.Now it is not likewise left to our discretion how great we want angle SAG to be, since it will be completely determined.From A draw a perpendicular to QT, and let this be AZ.Now, as above, let AC be \n",

       " or the sun's mean motion and the hypothesis proposed in Ch.8 according to Brahe's revision, in both instances there result false distances of the planet from the center, whether of the sun (for Copernicus and Brahe) or of the world (for Ptolemy).Consequently, what we had previously constructed from the Brahean observations we have later in turn destroyed using other observations of his.This was the necessary consequence of our having followed (in imitation of previous theorists) several things that were plausible but really false.And this much of the work is dedicated to this imitation of previous theorists, with which I am concluding this second part of the Commentaries.Chapter 22The epicycle, or annual orb, is not equally situated about the point of equality of motion.This, then, is the way our predecessors measured the first inequality.With this calculation established, which would represent the planet's eccentric position at any desired moment, they next turned to exploring the second inequality (which depends upon the sun), comparing the observed or apparent position with that which the eccentric and the planet's first inequality alone would assign.When I was on this same path and was confronted with this equivocal fork in the road (in Chapters 19 and 20 above), and the observations (most faithful guides) were seen to be at war with observations, I had to give thought to altering completely the way the path was set out, using the method which follows.First, in this third part I shall approach the second inequality.Here I shall use unquestionable observations to demonstrate, with either a confirmation or a refutation, all that I have hitherto supposed as principles but had doubts about.Once this is found it will be like a key: the rest will be opened up.Afterwards, in Part IV, I shall proceed to the first inequality.In Chapter 22 of the Mysterium cosmographicum, when I was giving the physical cause of the Ptolemaic equant or of the Copernican-Tychonic second epicycle, I raised an objection against myself at the end of the chapter: if the cause I proposed were true, it ought to hold universally for all planets ^1.But since the earth, one of the celestial bodies (for Copernicus), or the sun (for the rest) had not hitherto required this equant, I decided to leave that speculation open, until the matter were clearer to astronomers.I nevertheless entertained a suspicion that this theory might perchance also have its equant.After I gained the recognition of Tycho, this suspicion was confirmed in me.For in a letter to me in Styria \n",

       " Brahe said the following:The annual orb according to Copernicus, or the epicycle according to Ptolemy, does not appear always of the same size, in comparisons made to the eccentric, but introduces a perceptible alteration in all three superior planets, so much so that for Mars the angle of difference reaches one degree 45' ^2.He also touched upon this point at the same time in the appendix to his Mechanica,3 an account of his studies.Also, his words in volume I p.209 of his letters4 are not much different, where he states the opinion that as an effect of the solar eccentricity a certain amount of nonuniformity is also mixed in with the eccentric equations and the acronychal positions.This is, in fact, refuted in Part I: it is not reflected in the acronychal positions, or at least very little.But it appears that this needs to be understood through a certain correction regarding Mars at 90Â° from the sun.Now when I heard that the annual orb grows and shrinks, an inspiration said to me that this illusion arises thus: Copernicus's annual orb, or Ptolemy's epicycle, is not everywhere distant from that center about which by supposition it is sweeping out equal angles in equal times.For what physical cause  could make the circuit of the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or of the circuit of the earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle bearing the star (for Ptolemy) grow and shrink?What, I ask, is this novelty unprecedented in astronomy, this unlikely absurdity?Wouldn't it seem more worthy of belief that the sun (for Copernicus) or the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or the body of the planet (for Ptolemy) would in certain places be farther from, and in others nearer to, the selected point of uniform motion (at rest for Copernicus and Tycho, and moving around on the circumference of the eccentric for Ptolemy)âand this especially on the line of apsides?And for this, that suspicion of mine arising from my Mysterium cosmographicumâthat an equant might be introduced into the theory of the sun (or, as I call it, the theory of the Ptolemaic epicycle)âseemed to provide a convenient occasion.Let us suppose that the second inequality starts from the line of the sun's mean motion, as the practitioners have hitherto been pleased to hold (lest anyone hold suspect here my innovation of using the sun's apparent motion), and in the present diagram let the planet's eccentricity for Copernicus originate not from the sun's center A, but from the point C about which the earth's motion is supposed regular.But let that point C not be the center of the earth's orb DE but only of uniformity of motion, and let its distance from the sun A be greater than that of B, the center of the earth's orb ED.I say that, these things being granted, such observations will be produced from which one might suspect the annual orb of growing and shrinking.Let a line CF be drawn from C perpendicular to DE, and let the star Mars be at F twice: once when the earth is at D and again when it is at E; and let F be joined with the points D and E. Now because C is the point of uniformity of the earth's motion on DE, FCD and FCE will be the anomaly of commutation, and (as we suppose) equal on both sides.Now if CD and CE were equal (as has hitherto been thought) then the angles DFC and EFC, parallaxes of the orb, would be equal on both sides, for both anomalies of commutation.But because CE is greater than CD, the angle CFE will also appear greater than the angle CFD.Therefore, anyone not noticing that this growth occurs only at or about E, and that the contrary diminution occurs only at the contrary position D, will think that the entire annual orb sometimes gets larger, with radius CE, and sometimes smaller, with radius CD.This is because such a person presupposes, along with astronomy as it has hitherto been practiced, that the point of equal motion C is at the same time also the center of the circle DE.In the Ptolemaic form, let the earth be at C, and the lines of the sun's mean motion be CK, CL, in place of DC and EC in the preceding Copernican arrangement.And let the center about which the epicyclic motion is regular be at F, and IH be equal and parallel to ED so that, CI being drawn, it is parallel to DF and CH to  EF.For when the earth (or the observer) is transferred to the center of the world C, as Ptolemy has it, Mars at F is likewise transferred to H. Similarly, owing to the translation of D to C, F is transferred to I. Now Ptolemy, thinking that the point F, about which the motion of the epicycle IH is uniform, is also the center of the epicycle IH, supposed FI and FH to be exactly equal.Consequently, for both of the equated anomalies HFC as well as IFC (that is, at both 90Â° and 270Â°, in this diagram) he posited one and the same equation of the epicycle, namely, the equal angles HCF and ICF.So if observation affirms that HCF is greater than ICF, then the center of the epicycle will not be at the point of uniform motion F, but at G, in the direction of H. Further, on the supposition that F be nevertheless considered the center of the epicycle, the epicycle will appear distinctly enlarged at anomaly 90Â° at H, and diminished at 270Â° at I, while in both instances Mars, in its eccentric position (that is, on the line CF), is in the same position with respect to the fixed stars.In the Tychonic form, let C remain the earth, DE the sun's circle with center B, but let the center of uniform motion be A. And let the lines along which the planet is seen (namely, CI and CH) be the same as in Ptolemy.Accordingly, let HL, IK descend from H and I parallel to FC.In order that K and L be the center of the planetary system, let the center of its circuit be M, which is in the direction of the sun's perigee, so that the point M, the center of the circuit KL (in which is found the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) descends as far below C as the point B, the true center of the sun's circuit (contrary to common opinion), descends below A, the putative center of the same circuit of the sun.And let AC and BM be equal.The line of equated motion on the eccentric (that is, KI, LH) will be parallel to itself after an integral number of returns of the planet.Therefore Tycho, thinking that the earth C is in the middle of the circuit KL bearing the planets' eccentrics, will make angles CIK, CHL equal when the angles of commutation CLH, CKI are equal.But if these are perceived to be unequal, CHL being the greater, CL will be longer than CK: and the orb KL, the deferent of the center of the system, will appear to grow at L and to shrink at K, because M, the center of the orb which is the planetary system's deferent, is not believed to be elsewhere than at the earth C, about whose center the motion of that orb is uniform.Now what greatly contributes to obscuring the true cause of this difference, namely, to freeing the sun's eccentricity from suspicion, is the fact that thereby*  the distance CK of the center of the system from the earth becomes short just where the distance CE of the sun from the earth becomes long; and conversely, that the former, CL, becomes long where the latter, CD, becomes short.The reason why the apsides have thus been reversed is this.For Copernicus, the earth traverses the regions opposite the Tychonic sun and the Ptolemaic epicycle, and also DC, CE, the distances of the earth from the sun, of the sun from the earth, and of Mars H or I from the epicycle's center of uniform motion F, subtend angles of the same magnitude in all three forms of hypothesis.Therefore, it also happens that the Copernican distances of the sun and the earth will be transferred to the opposite sides by Brahe and Ptolemy; that is, CE to CL or FH, and CD to CK or FI.Next, in order either to confirm or undermine this speculation by observations, this is the road upon which I  set out.Since the sun's apogee is at 5Â½Â° Cancer, I enquired whether there might exist an observation in which Mars, reckoned by the first inequality, would be twice at 5Â½Â° Libra or Aries, while the sun would be at 5Â½Â° Cancer at one time, and then at 5Â½Â° Capricorn.As it turns out, this is not possible within such a short space of time (20 or 30 years).For the periodic motions of Mars and the sun are incommensurable, nor do they ever coincide at 90Â° from one another, or at opposition, after a certain number of complete periods, or quarter or half periods, of either.I therefore had to choose the next best thing, which was to find many days throughout those 20 years on which the planet was observed, and in which the equated anomaly of commutation was 90Â° or 270Â° or nearly that much, with Mars at 6 Aries or Libra or thereabouts.Afterwards, it was necessary to look up all those dates in the catalog of observations of Mars, so I could see whether it had been observed at those moments.Had the indefatigable Tycho Brahe not observed Mars very frequently, the selection would have been so exclusive that I would not have been able to accomplish what I wished.Now since Tycho put the apogee of Mars at 23Â½Â° Leo, while the required position of Mars, corrected by the eccentric equation, was 5Â½Â° Libra, an equated anomaly of 42Â° was required.And from his table, to an equated anomaly of 42Â° there corresponds an equation of 8Â° 15â'; therefore, a mean anomaly on the eccentric of 50Â° 16' was required, and through this I was shown twelve points in time in the twenty \n",

       " what had to be skillfully tracked down is whether for any of these times there was an equated anomaly of commutation that was at one time 90Â° and again 270Â°, or if the former were greater or less, the latter would be correspondingly less or greater.One revolution of Mars has 687 days, and two of the sun have 730Â½.The difference is 43Â½ days, to which corresponds 42Â° 54' 23\" of the sun's mean motion.This, therefore, is how much the anomaly of commutation changes at the end of any revolution of Mars.Therefore, when in any two year period one seeks two anomalies of commutation that are equal, with Mars at the same eccentric position, each angle of commutation should be 21Â° 27'.Over four years 42Â° 54' is required; over six years, 64Â° 22'; over eight years, 85Â° 49'.And we were supposing 90Â°, if it were possible.Therefore, we had to look for our two observations eight years apart.However, a team of two such observations is not to be found in the catalog of observations we had.I next turned to the interval of six years, and found at length that from \n",

       "; and at the same time the sun's mean position at those times is ÎÎ¤, ÎÎ, ÎÎ, ÎÎ§, respectively, so that ÎÎ and ÎÎ¤ are parallel (as is known from the Ptolemaic hypothesis), and soon for the rest.With Î, Î, Î, and Î connected with Î, it will be demonstrated as before, with exactly the same numbers, lines, and angles, that these lines are unequal, contrary to common opinion, and consequently that Mars does not traverse the circle ÎÎ, whose center is at the center of uniform motion Î, but the circle ÎÎÎÎ instead, whose center lies in the direction of Î from Î, very near to the line ÎÎ, which should be parallel to the line drawn from the earth Î through the sun's perigee.Therefore, the epicycle's apogee lies in the direction of the sun's perigee.And because the epicycle, owing to the total equivalence just mentioned, is to be supposed equal to the sun's circuit, with ÎÎ parallel to Î§Î, ÎÎ to ÎÎ, ÎÎ to ÎÎ, and ÎÎ to Î¤Î, it is also likely that Î§Î, ÎÎ, ÎÎ, and Î¤Î are unequal, and that the point of the sun's mean position (the center of the sun's epicycle, in the Brahean conception) does not stand at the same distance from the point of uniform motion throughout its circuit.This I remark only in passing: it has no effect upon the present demonstration, but serves as an extension to it.In the Tychonic form, let A be the earth, and about it let the sun's concentric CD be described, and let this be considered to be the deferent of the system of the planets, since A is the point of uniform motion of the sun's concentric.Therefore the sun itself will be on another eccentric circle.Let its center be in the direction of B from A. Now let AL be the reference for Mars's line of apsides, so that the line of apsides, in the circling and translating of its eccentric, remains ever parallel to AL.And let the lines of the sun's mean motion at our four moments be AH, AT, AE, AS, and from A let the lines along which Mars is observed be extended in the direction of one or another degree of the zodiac in accordance with the description above.And since at all fourtimes Mars is supposed to be at the same place on the eccentric, its distances from the points of the sun's mean position will all be equal and parallel.Let them be GH, FT, IE, and KS, all equal, and let the angles LHG, LTF, LEI, LSK, all be equal to the previous angle ÎÎÎ or Î»Î±Îº, so that at our moments Mars might be at G, F, I, K. I would note in passing that these four points G, F, I, K, in actual fact will make an arc exactly equal in length and placement to the previous arc ÎÎÎÎ in the Ptolemaic form.This is because there is no difference between the two other than that Ptolemy has an epicycle, equal to the [circle of the] theory of the sun, carried around on an eccentric, while Tycho has the eccentric carried around on the [circle of the] theory of the sun or on a circle equal to the Ptolemaic epicycle.Once again, then, with the angles and numbers remaining the same, it will be demonstrated, contrary to common opinion, that the lines AH, AT, AE, AS are unequal.And so that point on the eccentric whence originates the eccentricity of Mars and all the planets (which is here considered to be on the line of the sun's mean motion, following earlier practitioners) does not go around on that circle DC about whose center A it makes equal angles in equal times, but on the circle HTES whose center lies in the direction opposite the center of the sun's eccentric B, as has thus far become roughly clear from the lines themselves.Chapter 25From three distances of the sun from the center of the world, with known zodiacal positions, to find the apogee and eccentricity of the sun or earth.I shall now once again test the quantity of the eccentricity and the position of the apogee in a single circle adapted to all three forms.For it is easily seen that they are simply opposites: for example, in the Copernican form the longest line is towards Gemini, while in the other forms it is towards Sagittarius.This is because Copernicus's observer is looking towards the center, and the others are looking away from it.Thus Copernicus too looks across the center at the same parts of the zodiac as the others.Let the circle Î¸Î·ÎµÎ¶, with center Î², be set out, in which from the given point Î± there are the given lines Î±Î¸, Î±Î·, Î±Îµ, and Î±Î¶, as before, with the angles about Î± also given, for each of them is 42Â° 52' 47\".What is sought is both the magnitude Î±Î² and the direction of that line with respect to the fixed stars or to the other lines.Let Î¸, Î·, and Îµ be selected and joined with one another, since three points suffice for investigating this.First, in the triangle Î¸Î±Î· the sides and the included angle are given, Î¸Î· is sought, and is shown by trigonometry to be \n",

       " or 1800.So here somewhat less than half of the solar eccentricity is claimed for the eccentricity of our circle.But you should bear in mind that observations near minimum values may be somewhat in error, and that use was made of a questionable mean longitude and equation from Tycho.This will become quite clear if you will carry out the same operation with the angle Î¸Î·Î¶, and then with Î·ÎµÎ¶ and Î¸ÎµÎ¶.For each time, Î±Î² has a somewhat different magnitude, and its position beneath the fixed stars will fall one side or the other of 5Â½Â° Capricorn and Cancer.Consequently, we shall look into this more carefully below, where in many instances, through a fine demonstration, the eccentricity will be found to be half the solar eccentricity, and the apogee very near the Tychonic one.It has thus been demonstrated in the Copernican form that the center of the earth's circuit is halfway between the sun's body and the point of uniform motion of that circuit.That is, that the earth proceeds nonuniformly on its orbit, slowing when it recedes far from the sun and speeding up when it approaches.This is in conformity with physical principles and with the analogy with other planets.In the same way it has been demonstrated in the Ptolemaic form that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point about which its motion is uniform, and that its eccentricity is half of the sun's eccentricity as it is commonly determined, and in the opposite direction.Finally, in the Tychonic form it has been demonstrated that the point whence originate the planets' eccentricities does not move on the sun's concentric, but throughout its course is unequally distant from the earth, about which it moves regularly and uniformly; and that it is farther away near the sun's perigee, and nearer at apogee, again by half of the sun's eccentricity.And so, since this Ptolemaic epicycle and this Brahean deferent have so great an analogy with the theory of the sun, it is likely that they also have a greater analogy: that is, the sun's true eccentricity, too, will only be half of that computed from the maximum equation; or, what is the same thing, the sun will make use of an equant, whose eccentricity is twice the eccentric's eccentricity.I admit that this line of argument is a little weaker when applied to the Ptolemaic and Tychonic form, insofar as we are using the sun's mean motion, following the authorities.The argument consequently will become clearer when, moved by those reasons adduced in Chapter 6 above, I measure out the planet's motion by the sun's apparent motion.Chapter 26demonstration from the same observations that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point of attachment or axis, and that the annual orb (and so also the earth's path around the sun, or the sun's around the earth) is eccentric with respect to the body of the sun or earth, with an eccentricity just half that which Tycho Brahe found through equations of the sun's motion.We shall now go through the observations1 again, carefully: On \n",

Thus, the line Î³Î± would now be placed too far to the east.Therefore, letting Î´ and Î³ remain, let Î±Î· be supposed shorter.Then the center Î³ moves perpendicularly toward the line Î´Î·, and Î´Î³ thus becomes shorter.And because Î³ approaches Î´Î· perpendicularly, it recedes obliquely from the present Î³Î±.Hence, if a straight line be drawn from Î± through the new position of Î³, it will be inclined back towards Î´.You thus see how shortening Î±Î· helps us in two ways.But to shorten Î±Î· is a very easy, small change, because the angles are small: it can be done by saying that the planet was seen in a slightly prior position along a line drawn from Î· below Î¸.6 For example, let the observed position of Mars be 19Â° 40' Taurus, and the supplement Î±Î·Î¸ be 7Â° 58' 26\", and Î·Î¸Î± 5Â° 20' 8\": then Î±Î· will be 67,030.The second and third triangles are then changed, Î±Î·Î´ becoming 23Â° 53' 0\", and Î±Î·Î¶ 67Â° 15' 32\".Therefore, Î´Î·Î¶ is 43Â° 22' 26\", and Î´Î³Î¶ 86Â° 44' 52\".The remaining  angles are 93Â° 15' 8\", whose half, Î³Î´Î¶, is 46Â° 37' 34\", and Î³Î´Î± is 1Â° 10' 12\".Hence Î´Î³ is 67,892.And where this is \n",

       " at the same time, since the earth will be at the same distance from point Î³ when at the points Î´, Îµ, Î¶, Î·, the observations of Mars will also remain unchanged.Second Diagram: Ptolemaic Form9In the Ptolemaic form, the delineation can be done in two ways.In the first, let the earth replace the solar body at Î±, and then lines of vision be drawn out from Î± parallel to Î´Î¸, ÎµÎ¸, Î¶Î¸, Î·Î¸, so that the Copernican positions of the earth Î´, Îµ, Î¶, Î·  coalesce into one Ptolemaic position of the earth.Meanwhile, let the star Mars, which for Copernicus had stayed at one point Î¸, now be placed about Î¸ at four locations: Î¹, Îº, Î», Î¼. The description of this circle is as follows.Upward through Î¸ let Î¸Î½ be drawn equal and parallel to Î³Î±.And about center Î½, with radius Î³Îµ, let the circle Î¹ÎºÎ»Î¼ be  described.Thus the point Î¸, which we can call the point of attachment, moves around on the eccentric, which before, in Copernicus, the planet bodily traversed.While the epicycle is thus being borne around, the center Î½ is driven around Î¸, so that at one time it is inside Î¸Î± and at another it is outside; however, Î¸Î½ is always parallel to itself and to the line Î±Î³.And the epicycle will be moved uniformly, not about Î¸ to which it is attached, nor about its center Î½, but about a higher point, Î¿, such that Î¸Î¿ is twice Î¸Î½.For the earth too will thus be moved10 uniformly about Ï, not about the center of its orb Î³, nor about the sun at Î±.That these characteristics belong to the Ptolemaic epicycle, is properly demonstrated.But that they are carried over from the epicycle to the theory of the sun is shown by a probable argument only, pieced together from Ptolemaic opinions.For, keeping everything as it was, let Î±Ï be set up equal to Î±Ï and in the same line but in the opposite direction, so that ÏÎ± may be the center of the sun's uniform motion, which the theorists had thought to be the center of the sun's orbit.Therefore, the line Î¸Î½Î¿ will always be parallel to the line of the sun's apogee Î±Ï.Now, if you decide that the diurnal parallax of Mars should be kept in the same ratio to the sun's parallax as that given out by Tycho, Î¹ÎºÎ»Î¼ will also be equal to the [circle of the] sun's theory, and consequently Î¸Î¿ will also be equal to the eccentricity of the point Ï, about which the sun moves uniformly.But Î¹ÎºÎ»Î¼ also moves in the same direction in which the sun moves on its circle, according to Ptolemy, and at the same times both the sun on its eccentric and the planet on its epicycle are found in the same, or at least corresponding, places, so that lines from Ï through the sun and from Î¿ through the planet are ever parallel, again as taught by Ptolemy.So, since all other things are in agreement, why not this, too: that, just as Î¹ÎºÎ»Î¼ is moved uniformly, not about the center Î½ but about the point Î¿ above it, as is demonstrated here by the transposition of the eccentric of the earth into the epicycle, where we took Î¸ in place of Î±, Î½ for Î³, and Î¿ for Ï: so likewise, these points are distinct in the sun, so that the eccentricity Î±Ï, which is found from solar observations, is to be bisected at Î¾, with Î¾ the center of the sun's eccentric Î»ÏÏÏ?For Ptolemy made use of such a procedure to make it appear that if the sun's apparent positions were used, exactly the same eccentricity would be used on the planet's epicycle as was found in the sun.So since the observations give evidence of the double eccentricity of the Ptolemaic epicycle (because, as was said, the parallel relationships of the lines leave the triangles the same as in the Copernican form), the spirit of Ptolemy urges us to bisect the sun's eccentricity as well, so that the lines Î»Î¹, ÏÎº, ÏÎ», ÏÎ¼ remain parallel.So by this reasoning even Ptolemy will be persuaded that Î±Ï, the eccentricity of the sun's motion found by Tycho, should be bisected at Î¾, so that the center of the sun's orbit is at Î¾, and the uniformity of motion at Ï.Now this argument in the Ptolemaic form (as I just now began to say) is no firmer than the Ptolemaic world system itself.For anyone who believes Ptolemy, thinking that for the three superior planets there are three theories  of epicycles, exactly equal to the theory of the sun, in quantity and quality, in lines as well as motions, in absolutely all respectsâthis same person will not admit this one inconsistency, but will also gladly derive this bisection for the solar theory from the epicycle, as if from an image in a mirror to the face itself.And finally, when a comparison of hypotheses has been made, and it has appeared that four theories of the sun (or rather, six, as will be said elsewhere) can be generated from a single theory of the earth, like many images from one substantial face, the sun itself, the clearest of truth, will melt all this Ptolemaic apparatus like butter, and will disperse the followers of Ptolemy, some to Copernicus's camp, and some to Brahe's.Here, one might raise a question.The Ptolemaic epicycle has three notable points: the center Î½, the point Î¸ which we have called the point of attachment, and the point Î¿ about which its motion is uniform.Now since it is said that the line Î¸Î¿ remains parallel to Î±Ï throughout the entire circuit, what are the properties of the circuits described by the other two points Î½ and Î¿?In order to show this, let lines be drawn from Î¾ and ÏÎ± parallel to Î±Î², and from Î² and Ï parallel to Î±Ï, and let them be extended so as to intersect one another; and let the intersection of the lines from Î¾ and Î² be Ï, from Î¾ and Ï be Ï, from Ï and Î² be Ï, and from Ï and Ï be Ï. Now, just as the point Î¸ is moved regularly around Ï, traversing an eccentric described about Î², so also Î½ is moved regularly around Ï, traversing an eccentric described about Ï. Also, Î¿ is moved regularly about Ï, traversing a third eccentric likewise equal to the others, described about Ï. For all three of these eccentrics the zodiacal position of the apogee is the same, owing to the lines' Î±Ï, Î¾Ï, ÏÏ being parallel.But the word \"apogee\" cannot be applied properly to any of these, apart from the first, that belongs to the point Î¸, since its line of apsides Î±Î²Ï is drawn through the earth itself, which was placed at Î±, but not at Î¾ or Ï.It is indeed true that straight lines can be drawn from the earth Î± through the centers of the remaining two eccentrics Ï and Ï, which may properly be called \"lines of the apogee\".These will fall to the west of the apogee Î±Ï; that is, Î±Ï will be at 24Â° Leo, and Î±Ï at 19Â° Leo, approximately.But then these lines will not pass through the pertinent point of uniform motion of each eccentric.Thus, if any of Ptolemyâs followers does not wish to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point Î¸, but prefers to relate it to the center Î½, he will be driven to use two lines of apsides: one, Î±Ï, for the eccentric, and the other, Î±Ï, for the equant; and also two eccentricities, Î±Ï and Î±Ï.How intricate and inconvenient this is (for of its absurdity enough has been said in Chapter 6), let anyone so inclined judge.The same will happen if anyone wishes to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point Î¿, about which the epicycle revolves uniformly.For then the eccentric bearing  the point Î¿ will have two apogees and eccentricities, one for the center on the line Î±Ï, and the other for the point of uniformity of motion on the line Î±Ï.The remaining possibilities are either to attach the epicycle at Î¸, or improperly to take apogees for the eccentrics that bear the points Î½ and Î¿, and to compute the eccentricities from the points Î¾ and Ï, not from the reference point, the earth Î±.What has been given so far is the first delineation in the Ptolemaic form.The other can be constructed as follows.Let the Copernican positions of the earth Î´, Îµ, Î¶, Î·, merge, not in Î±, but in Î³, so that in this diagram, Î³, not Î±, denotes the earth, the center of the world.Here, the epicycle too, as well as its three eccentrics belonging to the points Î¸, Î½, Î¿, will be shifted from their positions by the amount Î±Î³, and a perfect equivalence will result.I shall forego further explanation, lest the reader become too confused, for this has really only been mentioned for smatterers or curiosity seekers.Tychonic Form11In the Tychonic form, there is no need of any new delineation.A very brief sketch is sufficient.The eccentric's point of attachment is set at the four different positions Î», Ï, Ï, Ï, so the planet is at Î¹, Îº, Î», Î¼, and Î¹Î», ÎºÎ±Ï, Î»Ï, Î¼Ï, and Î¸Î± parallel.Now Tycho himself made the center of the circle of Mars carry the double epicycle, and said that it goes around a uniformly on a circle concentric with the sun: for this idea he was indebted to Ptolemy.And in this matter, he, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, was strongly urged by me (in Ch.6 of Part I) to seek that point of attachment, whether it is the center of the concentric or of an eccentric, in the center of the solar body, this being supported by physical arguments and by the demonstration of its geometrical possibility.Additional support is provided by the valid argument of \n",

       " and 23, that unless this were done, even if the observations were referred to the sun's mean position, the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Brahean deferent would be made eccentric, in directions exactly opposite to the sun's eccentricity.I have also promised stronger arguments, deduced from Brahe's own observations, for abandoning the sun's concentric, and in Ch.52 and 57 below I will produce them ^12.But it has already been proved here in Chapter 26 that this center of Mars's concentric (or the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) is found, not on an equal eccentric described about the center of the sun's point of uniform motion Ï, as Brahe along with the other authorities had believed, but on an eccentric described about Î¾, which is in the middle position between Î± and Ï.</br>Therefore, if the center of Mars's concentric goes around with the sun, it nevertheless goes around on an eccentric described about Î¾, and consequently the sun itself will go around on an eccentric described about Î¾. But its motion is uniform about Ï. Therefore, the sun's eccentricity Î±Ï must be bisected at Î¾. For it is not likely that, although the centers of the concentrics of Mars and the sun go around in the same way, reach apogee at the same time, transpose their apogees in the same way, go slowly or quickly in the same way, and describe the same circumferences, their circles would nevertheless make different digressions from the earth in the same direction.Let it be enough for now, to present this form of demonstration in the three hypotheses.In what follows, whenever there is need of the same demonstration, I shall use Copernicus's form alone, it being simpler, so as not to be too long-winded.Now, in contrast, the industrious reader has seen how any of  these diagrams can be transformed into either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican form using parallel lines.Chapter 27From four other observations of the star Mars outside the acronychal situation but still in the same eccentric position, to demonstrate the eccentricity of the earth's orb, with its aphelion and the ratio of the orbs at that place, together with the eccentric position of Mars on the zodiac.Hitherto we have almost exclusively used the aphelion of Mars, along with the correction of the mean motion and the hypothesis of the equations found above.If these should err by a single minute in defining the planet's zodiacal longitude, as can easily happen, this creates considerable difficulty for us in the present undertaking.So now, at this point, we shall take for granted nothing whatever except Mars's periodic time, concerning which there can be no doubt, and the sun's zodiacal positions from Tycho's calculation.We shall also, I grant, assume an eccentric position, as is the common procedure in demonstrations leading to an impossibility, but we shall test that very position using repeated suppositions.These are the observations.\n",

       " there is but a single day that can be related to the others, and nothing else was observed for a long time before and after, let us refer the other times to this one.The catalog of them, along with the apparent positions of the sun and Mars, and with the eccentric position of Mars, is this: 1Let the diagram be made as before, with Î± the sun, Î² the center of the earth's eccentric, Î¶, Î´, Îµ, Î³ the four positions of the earth, Î· the position of Mars on its eccentric, and let each point be connected with all the others.Now, from the data,Now because there stand two angles upon the arc Î¶Îµ at the circumference of the circle, namely Î¶Î´Îµ, Î¶Î³Îµ, by Euclid III.21 these must be equal.And in order that they come out equal, Î±Î· must be moved forward and backward above Î± beneath the zodiac as long as [is necessary] ^2.And since in this first trial the zodiacal position for Î±Î· is given, let it therefore be tried whether Î¶Î´Îµ, Î¶Î³Îµ might be equal, for then it will be established that the position of Î±Î· is correct.In the four triangles Î¶Î±Î´, Î´Î±Îµ, ÎµÎ±Î³, Î¶Î±Î³, the same number of angles is sought, namely Î¶Î´Î±, ÎµÎ´Î±, ÎµÎ³Î±, Î¶Î³Î± in order to get ÎµÎ´Î¶, ÎµÎ³Î¶.Now in any of these triangles the angles at Î± are given by the position of the sun from Tycho, and the correction for the precession of the equinoxes.But the sides comprehending those angles have just been found.Therefore, the angles, too, will be given.Since these angles didn't quite come out equal, I made a second trial with Î±Î·'s sidereal position moved forward 2'.And I found ÎµÎ´Î¶ to be 21Â° 40' 9\", ÎµÎ³Î¶ 21Â° 22' 14\", differing by 18', which is twice the previous discrepancy.Whence it is understood that Î±Î· should have been moved backwards to a lesser longitude, rather than forwards.For a third trial, then, supposing Marsâs eccentric position in 1585 was 5Â° 20' 2\"  Libra, ÎµÎ´Î¶ came out to be 21Â° 15' 54\", and ÎµÎ³Î¶ 21Â° 13' 54\".There remains a difference of 2â, which we may safely ignore.Nevertheless, by extrapolating we realize that at this place Mars's eccentric position has to be moved back3 through 2Â½â, just as previously in Chapter 22 it was moved forward 1' on the opposite semicircle.Both of these are brought about by an increase of the eccentricity and a slight retraction of the aphelion.Let us now proceed to the investigation of the rest.And because each of the angles in question has decreased, they will decrease further when Î±Î· is moved back.Therefore, let each be 21Â° 13', and Î¶Î²Îµ, the double angle at the center, be 42Â° 26'.Therefore, Î¶ÎµÎ² is 68Â° 47'.In triangle Î¶Î±Îµ angle Î¶Î±Îµ is 42Â° 6' 57\", and the sides are given by a new correction, so that Î±Î¶ is \n",

       " the opposite line Î±Î· is the same size.For finding the intermediate distances of two opposite degrees of equated anomaly, let Î¸Î¹ be inspected, passing through the body Î± whence the eccentricity is computed.Now Î´Î±Î¸ and Î´Î±Î¹ are equated anomalies, and are opposite, in that Î± is between them and is collinear with them.Now let a line Î²Îº fall from Î² perpendicular to Î¸Î¹, so as to make Î¸Îº, ÎºÎ¹ equal.In the right triangle Î²ÎºÎ± the base Î²Î± is given, as well as the angles ÎºÎ±Î² (from the integral number of degrees of equated anomaly chosen) and its complement ÎºÎ²Î±.Therefore, the sides ÎºÎ±, ÎºÎ² will not be unknown.And ÎºÎ² is the sine of the angle ÎºÎ¸Î² or ÎºÎ¹Î².This being given, its complement, Î¸Î²Îº or Î¹Î²Îº, will also be known, and its sine, which is the line Î¸Îº or ÎºÎ¹.And when ÎºÎ± is added to ÎºÎ¸, Î±Î¸ is obtained; and when the same is subtracted from ÎºÎ¹, Î±Î¹ is obtained.The former distance corresponds to the equated anomaly Î´Î±Î¸, and the latter to the equated anomaly Î´Î±Î¹, which line has a line equal to itself in the preceding semicircle, standing as far from aphelion in semicircle Î´Î¸ as Î±Î¹ itself does in semicircle Î´Î·.Now through Î± let the straight line Î¼Î½ be drawn intersecting the circle in Î¼, Î½, and making the angle Î¼Î±Î´ equal to the angle ÎºÎ²Î±.And from Î² let Î²Î» fall perpendicular to Î¼Î½ bisecting Î¼Î½ at Î». And let Î¼, Î½ be connected to Î². Now, since ÎºÎ±Î² is an angle of an integral number of degrees, the remainder ÎºÎ²Î±, and Î¼Î±Î´ equal to it, are also an integral number of degrees, and in the similar triangles Î²ÎºÎ±, Î²Î»Î± side ÎºÎ± is equal to side Î»Î², and ÎºÎ² to Î»Î±.But Î»Î² is the sine of angle Î»Î¼Î², Î»Î½Î², and the complement of Î»Î¼Î² is Î»Î²Î¼, Î»Î²Î½.And the sine of this is the lines Î»Î¼, Î»Î½, and the difference between these and Î±Î¼, Î±Î½ is Î»Î±.But the magnitudes Î»Î±, Î»Î² have just now been found in triangle Î±Î²Îº.Therefore, by the use of one triangle, four distances can be found making equal angles about Î± with the line of apsides and its perpendicular Î¶Î· drawn through Î±. For Î¼Î±Î¶ is equal to Î¸Î±Î´, and Î½Î±Î· to Î¹Î±Îµ ^6.So the greatest distance is at Î´, the shortest at Îµ, but the mean, which is equal to Î²Î¶, is not at Î¶Î·.Neither is it on a line through Î² parallel to Î¶Î± which shall be called Î¾Î¿.For Î±Î¶ is less than Î²Î¶, since Î¶Î²Î± is subtended by a smaller line than Î¶Î±Î², which is right, and, Î±Î¾ being drawn, it is longer than Î²Î¾, since it subtends a greater angle Î¾Î²Î±.(which is right) while Î¾Î² subtends a lesser angle Î¾Î±Î².But in order that the place of the mean distances be defined geometrically, let Î±Î² be bisected at Ï, and through this let ÏÏ be drawn perpendicular to Î±Î², intersecting the circle at Ï, Ï. I say that these are the points that are equally distant from Î± and Î².For let one of the points Ï be connected with Î± and Î². The lines ÏÎ± and ÏÎ² will subtend equal angles ÏÏÎ± and ÏÏÎ² (since they are right), and Î±Ï, ÏÎ² will be equal, and ÏÏ common.Therefore ÏÎ±, ÏÎ² are equal.And thus the demonstration taken from Reinhold7 concerning the whole Î±Î³ and its midpoint Î² remains true for the point Ï and its half Î±Î².One might think that since at Ï the distance Î±Ï becomes equal to the  semidiameter Î²Ï, the angle Î²ÏÎ± is also greater than Î²Î¶Î±, and thus the greatest equation occurs at Ï, on the argument that the straight line Î²Î± is presented more directly from Ï than from Î¶. However, this proposed line of reasoning is not true.For to the same extent that Î²Î± is more oblique with respect to Î¶, Ï in turn is more distant than Î¶, since ÏÏ is longer than Î¶Î±.For ÏÎ²Ï is greater than Î¶Î²Î±, which Î¶Î± subtends.So Ptolemy, and after him Reinhold in the Theoricae, demonstrated correctly that the greatest equation (eccentric equation alone, or optical part) occurs at Î¶ ^8.I shall, however, set up this demonstration in another, simpler form.Let any point be taken above Î¶, such as Î¸, and any below Î· or Î¶, such as Î¹. Let them be connected with Î±, and from Î² let perpendiculars Î²Îº fall to Î¸Î± or Î¹Î± extended.Now since Î´Î±Î¶ and Î²ÎºÎ± are equal, they being right angles, and ÎºÎ²Î±, ÎºÎ±Î² together are equal to one right angle, when the same angle Î´Î±Î¸ or Î²Î±Îº is subtracted from the equals, the equals Î¸Î±Î¶, ÎºÎ²Î± will remain.And first, let a line be drawn through Î± above Î¶, as Î¸Î± was just drawn, whether Î¸ is next to Î¶ or remote.At the same time let its perpendicular Î²Îº be inclined to Î²Î±.Now Î²Î± is greater than any of the perpendiculars Î²Îº, since Î²Î± is subtended by the right angle Î²ÎºÎ±, while Î²Îº is subtended by the smaller, acute angle Î²Î±Îº.Now since Î²Î¶, Î²Î¸, Î²Î¹ are equal, and Î²Î±Î¶, Î²ÎºÎ¸, Î²ÎºÎ¹ are right, they fit onto the same semicircle, whose diameter is equal to Î²Î¶, Î²Î¸, Î²Î¹.And Î²Î±, being longer, subtends a greater part of the circumference of any such semicircle than does Î²Îº or any of the perpendiculars; and for that reason, its angle Î²Î¶Î± will be greater than Î²Î¸Îº, or the angle of the equation for any other point above Î¶, such as Ï or Î¾. Which was tobe demonstrated.Everything said in this chapter about the computing of distances of the sun and earth will also be valid for Mars, as long as one of the suppositions is that the orbits of planets are perfect circles.When this is seen as false, another method of computing them will be given.CHAPTER 3On the equivalence and unanimity of different points of observation and of hypotheses, for laying out one and the same planetary path.Next, I must show how one and the same planetary motion, while in itself remaining the same, can display one or another appearance, and how the pair of forms are equivalent here.About centers A and Î³, with equal radii AC, Î³Îµ, let the circles CD, ÎµÎ¶ be described with CA, ÎµÎ³ drawn through the centers parallel to one another, and other lines AB, Î³Î´, and AD, Î³Î¶, through the centers inclined to the former, both pairs likewise parallel.Also, about B let an epicycle be described, with radius BE, and likewise  about D with radius DG equal to BE.Let the planet be placed at E and G, so that DG and AB are parallel.On the line Î´Î³ let a segment equal to BE be set out on the side opposite Î´, and let it be Î³Î².Let G be joined with A and Î¶ with Î². The hypotheses will therefore be equivalent, by the preceding chapter, and to an observer placed at A and Î², EAG and Î´Î²Î¶ will be equal.EA and Î´Î² will also be equal, as well as GA and Î¶Î².And finally, the arcs EG and Î´Î¶ will be equal.Now let a smaller epicycle be described upon BCD with radii BI, CF, DH, and let AC be extended to F, and BI and DH be parallel to CF.And let the planet be on IFH.Again, by ch.2, the circle IFH will be equal to the circle Î´Î¶.Next, extend the arc IF from the point Î´, so as to end at Îµ, and from Îµ through Î³ draw ÎµÎ³, such that ÎµÎ³ is parallel to CA.And let a magnitude equal to CF be set out on the line ÎµÎ³, and let it be Î³Î±, on the side opposite Îµ. Let I and H be joined with A, and also Î´ and Î¶ with Î±. Again, therefore, the hypotheses will be equivalent by the preceding chapter, and to an observer placed at A and Î±, FAH and ÎµÎ±Î¶ will be equal, as well as FAI and ÎµÎ±Î´.FA and ÎµÎ± will also be equal, as well as HA and Î¶Î±, and IA and Î´Î±.And finally, the arcs FH and ÎµÎ¶ will be equal and similar, as are also FI and ÎµÎ´, by construction.Therefore, if the path of the planet remain the same while the observer is moved from Î² to Î±, different appearances will be produced at the same moments of time.For the same places, Î´ and Î¶, are viewed in different ways from Î² and Î±. On the other hand, if the observer remain at A, and the quantity of the planet's path EG, IH remain the same while changing its place, the planet will again appear in different places, even when at the same place on its path, because the entire path has been shifted.Accordingly, since the planet, whether viewed from Î± or Î², is at Î´, or at Î¶, at the same moment in each observation, and the hypotheses are entirely equivalent, it must also be said that I and E, which are positions of different epicycles, are occupied by the planet at the same moment.The same is true of G and H. The only difference is that in the first diagram the planet's path is shifted by altering the epicycle in its position, the observer remaining in the same place, while in the second diagram, for the planet's path the position also stays the same while the observer's position is changed by the same amount in the opposite direction.If required, however, it is possible to keep the path fixed in the former and the observer fixed in the latter fixed by shifting what is now fixed, in accordance with thedemonstrations of the preceding chapter.This demonstration will be put to use below.For surely, if the first inequality of the superior planets could be accounted for by the simple hypothesis of the second chapter, no difficulty would arise as to whether one should examine the first inequality at mean opposition to the sun, or at apparent opposition.For the actual path would in fact remain the same, and in both models the planet would be at the same points of the path at any given moment.Only the position of this path, in the first model, would be altered through the space of the sun's eccentricity, while in the second, although the path would stay fixed, the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned would also be shifted by the same amount.In the physical account, the above characteristics remain unchanged.Only their quantities change as the motive powers are intensified.Chapter 30Table of the distance of the sun from the earth and its useWe have gathered together here into a three-columned table the distances of the sun accumulated in this way [that is, in the way described in ch.29], as if they were done for integral degrees of equated anomaly for the whole semicircle (for those in the other semicircle at equal distances from apogee are also equal to these).In the first column, which we have called \"mean anomaly\", are the angles Î´Î²Î¼, Î´Î²Î¸, Î´Î²Î¾, Î´Î²Î¹, Î´Î²Î½, composed of the integral angles Î´Î±Î¼, Î´Î±Î¸, Î´Î±Î¾, Î´Î±Î¹, Î´Î±Î½, and their optical or eccentric equations, namely, Î²Î¼Î±, Î²Î¸Î±, Î²Î¾Î±, Î²Î¹Î±, Î²Î½Î±.In the second, the distances themselves, Î±Î¼, Î±Î¸, Î±Î¾, Î±Î¹, Î±Î½, are placed together opposite [the mean anomalies].In the third, under the heading \"equated anomaly,\" are tabulated angles not depicted here, but the  procedure for whose generation will be revealed in part here and in part in Chapters 31 and 40.For they are constituted by subtraction of the optical equations Î±Î¼Î² and so forth from Î´Î±Î¼ and so forth.Thus we have given no column to the integral angles like Î´Î±Î¼, because they are the arithmetic mean between the angles of the columns at the sides, and thus are easily found in themselves, and are not of any use, as we shall hear.Therefore, beginning with either the mean or the equated anomaly, either  one going into its proper respective column as use will dictate; or, where it exceeds a semicircle, beginning with the full-circle complement of either of these; you find the requisite distance of the sun from the earth, in units of which the radius of the orb is \n",

       ", when investigated in both the sines and tangents1 produces the same arc.Therefore, as the radius CE is to the sine of the angle CAE or CAD, so is the eccentricity CA to the equation CEA or CDA, which are both 1Â° 27' 31\".And in this first way, Ptolemy computed the equations of the sun, and, following Ptolemy, Copernicus; and, following both, Brahe: each of them using only the eccentricity AC, whose magnitude they found through their observations.There now follows a second way of computing the same equations, of which Ptolemy made use in the other planets, and of which I should make use.For I have demonstrated in this third part that the center of the eccentric is not at the point C, the center of uniform motion, but at B, the midpoint between the center of the world A and the point of uniformity C.Therefore let CA be bisected at B, and let EB, BD, be the radius of the orb.By the same method, the part of the equation BDA, BEA, will be 0Â° 43' 46\", which, added to EAB, DAB, will result in an angle EBC of 45Â° 43' 46\", and DBC, of 135Â° 43' 46\".As a result, from the sides and the included angle, BEC comes out to be 43' 38\", and BDC 43' 42\".Thus the whole angle CEA is 1Â° 27' 24\", and CDA is 1Â° 27' 28\", within a hair's breadth of the previous value.And so, in the appendix to Tycho Brahe's Progymnasmata p.821, where the difference of the two calculations is given as 1ââ, you should read ââ2.And this is in accord with the conclusions of Ch.4 applied to the form of the vicarious hypothesis.And since you may observe that in this particular form of Ptolemaic hypothesis the parts of the equation are nearly equal (for the optical part was 43' 46\" and the physical part was 43' 38\" at E and 43' 42\" at D), you see why, in the construction of the table in the preceding chapter, all I did was double the equation to establish the total equation.And this is the third way of computing the sun's equations.For at apogee and perigee both parts of the equation vanish, and in the middle elongations the parts are again equal, as was just now said.Therefore, since these three ways of computing the equations clearly coincide in eight places distributed about the entire circle, they will perceptibly coincide everywhere.This is a result of the smallness of the eccentricity: if itwere greater, this coincidence would not take place everywhere.Now I shall prepare myself for finding yet a fourth way to the equation,to be computed not through an arbitrary hypothesis but from the very nature of things, in eight chapters.Accordingly, this fourth way can finally follow in Chapter 40.Chapter 32The power that moves the planet in a circle diminishes with removal from its source.I have said above that Ptolemy, well informed by the observations, bisected the eccentricities of the three superior planets, that Copernicus imitated this, and that Tycho's observations of Mars also urge the same conclusion, as has been seen in Chapters 19 and 20, and will appear with much greater certainty below in Chapter 42.In addition, Tycho closely imitated this in his lunar theory.And now the same thing has been demonstrated in the theory of the sun (for Tycho) or of the earth (for Copernicus).Further, there is nothing to prevent our believing the same of Venus and Mercury.Indeed, I now take it as proven that this is the origin of the belief that the centers of these planets' eccentrics move around on a small annual circle.Therefore all planets have this [double eccentricity].Now in my Mysterium cosmographicum, published eight years ago,*  I postponed arguing this case of the cause of the Ptolemaic equant for the sole reason that it could not be said on the basis of ordinary astronomy whether the sun or earth uses an equalizing point and has its eccentricity bisected.However, now that we have the confirmation of a sounder astronomy, it should be transparently clear that there is indeed an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.And, I say, now that this is demonstrated, it is proper to accept as true and legitimate the cause to which I assigned the Ptolemaic equant in the Mysterium cosmographicum, since it is universal and common to all the planets.So in this part of the work I shall make a further declaration of that cause.And since the declaration will be general, I shall use the word, \"planet\".However, in this and the next few chapters, the reader may always understand by this, in particular, the earth for Copernicus or the sun for Tycho.First, the reader should know that in every hypothesis constructed according to this Ptolemaic form, however great the eccentricity, the speed at perihelion and slowness at aphelion are very closely proportional to the lines drawn from the center of the world to the planet.In the diagram of Chapter 29, in which Î± was the center of the world, Î² was the center of the eccentric Î´Îµ, and Î³ was the point of the equant, let the equant circle ÏÏ be described about center Î³, with radius equal to Î²Î´.And through the center of the world Î±, from which the eccentricity is reckoned (and in the business at hand, it is the sun for Copernicus and the earth for the others), let the straight line ÏÏ be drawn, intersecting the eccentric at Ï and Ï, so that the planet is at Ï and Ï, having traversed the arcs of the eccentric Î´Ï and ÎµÏ, from apogee or aphelion and from perigee  or perihelion, respectively.It is supposed that these arcs appear equal from Î±, since the straight line ÏÏ makes the vertical angles ÏÎ±Î´ and ÏÎ±Îµ, which are equal.But since Î´Ï and ÎµÏ are taken as minimal arcs, as if at the apsides Î´ and Îµ, they do not differ perceptibly from straight lines.And so, just as Î´Î±Ï and ÎµÎ±Ï were rectilinear triangles, with right angles at Î´ and Îµ, and a common vertex Î±, Î´Î± will be to ÎµÎ± as arc Î´Ï is to arc ÎµÏ.But Î±Î´ is longer than Î±Îµ.Therefore, arc Î´Ï is longer than ÎµÏ.These arcs, which are in fact unequal, appear equal from Î±. The question now is, how much time will the planet take to traverse each arc, according to Ptolemy's theory and hypothesis, when it has an equant?So let straight lines be drawn from the center Î³ through the points Ï and Ï, intersecting the equant at Ï, Ï. Now Ptolemy will say, \"since the whole circle of the equant ÏÏ denotes the periodic time of the planet, then ÏÏ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric ÏÎ´, and ÏÏ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric ÎµÏ.\"And now I myself say that ÏÏ, thus designated as the arc of the time (as Ptolemy wished) is to the arc Î´Ï which the planet traverses, very nearly as Î±Î´, the distance of the arc Î´Ï from the center of the world, is to Î´Î² the mean distance of the points Ï and Ï from Î±. And likewise, the arc of the time ÏÏ is to the arc of the planet's motion ÎµÏ, approximately as Î±Îµ, the distance of the arc ÎµÏ from the center of the world Î± is to ÎµÎ² and Î±Ï, the mean distance from the center of the world, which may be found at the points Ï and Ï. And now, as before, as Î³Ï is to Î³Î´ so is ÏÏ to Î´Ï, and as Î³Ï is to Î³Îµ so is ÏÏ to ÎµÏ.But Î³Ï is to Î³Î´ very nearly as Î²Î´ (or Î³Ï) is to Î±Î´, and this is shown by the fact that Î²Î´ is the arithmetic mean between Î³Î´ and Î±Î´, since Ptolemy makes Î±Î², Î²Î³ equal.And further, the arithmetic mean between two terms whose ratio is near equality is only imperceptibly greater than the geometric mean.For example, the arithmetic mean between 10 and 12 is 11, and the geometric mean is about \n",
       "<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; box-decoration-break: clone; -webkit-box-decoration-break: clone\">\n",

       "</mark>\n",
       ", so that there is less than the twentieth part of a unit between the two means.Nevertheless, these numbers are of the order of the eccentricity of Mars, which according to Ptolemy has the greatest eccentricity of all the planets.And therefore, since the ratio Î³Ï to Î³Î´ is imperceptibly greater than the ratio Î±Î´ to Î´Î², ÏÏ will also have to ÏÎ´ a ratio imperceptibly greater than Î±Î´ to Î´Î².Likewise, as Î³Îµ is to Î³Ï, so is ÎµÏ to ÏÏ, but Î³Îµ is to Î³Ï approximately as ÎµÎ² is to Î±Îµ; that is, the former ratio is only imperceptibly less than the latter.Therefore, too, the ratio ÎµÏ to ÏÏ is only imperceptibly smaller than the ratio ÎµÎ² to Î±Îµ.Now let us permute the ratios.For the ratio Î±Î´ to Î´Î² is imperceptibly less than the ratio Î´Î² or Î²Îµ to ÎµÎ±, seeing that Î²Î´ or Î²Îµ is the arithmetic mean between Î±Î´ and Î±Îµ, as before.But it was proved that the ratio ÏÏ to Î´Ï is greater than the ratio Î±Î´ to Î´Î², from the smaller pair, and the ratio ÎµÏ to ÏÏ is less than the ratio ÎµÎ² to Î±Îµ,  from the greater pair, so that in the two ratios Î±Î´ to Î´Î² and ÎµÎ² to Î±Îµ, the amount by which the former terms will be greater and the latter smaller is, in the two ratios ÏÏ to Î´Ï and ÎµÏ to ÏÏ, the same as the amount by which the former is greater and the latter smaller.Consequently, there is some compensation even for that imperceptible difference, so that it is much more nearly true that the ratio of ÏÏ to Î´Ï is equal within a hair's breadth to the ratio of ÎµÏ to ÏÏ.Therefore, the arcs Î´Ï and ÎµÏ being taken as equal (which hitherto were unequal), either Î´Ï or ÎµÏ will be a mean proportional between ÏÏ, the increment of time at aphelion, and ÏÏ, the increment of time at perihelion.Consequently, the ratio ÏÏ to ÏÏ (Î´Ï and ÎµÏ being equal) will be in the duplicate ratio of Î±Î´ to Î´Î² or Î²Îµ to ÎµÎ±, the former smaller and the latter greater by an imperceptible difference.But since the ratio Î±Î´ to Î±Îµ is also the duplicate of either of these (for it is compounded of the two, which are nearly equal, taking the arithmetic mean Î´Î² or Î²Îµ), therefore, the arcs on the eccentric Î´Ï and ÎµÏ being equal, the ratio of the times ÏÏ to ÏÏ will be equal to the ratio Î±Î´ to Î±Îµ.Or, more clearly, the planet takes a proportionally longer time to traverse some particular eccentric arc at Î´ than to traverse an equal eccentric arc at Îµ, according as Î±Î´ is greater than Î±Îµ.And this follows from the way the Ptolemaic form*  is ordered, and from its equalizing point, by means of a proof that is certain and valid so far as it concerns points near apogee and perigee.At other points there appears a very small discrepancy, which is all the smaller in effect the more obvious it is in the demonstration.This is because (for example) the ratio Î±Î¼ to Î±Î½ is smaller, and the ratio Î±Î¸ to Î±Î¹ is much smaller, than Î±Î´ to Î±Îµ, the greatest ratio, where the effect is also greatest.Chapter 33The power that moves the planets resides in the body of the sunIt was demonstrated in the previous chapter that the increments of time of a planet on equal parts of the eccentric circle (or on equal distances in the aethereal air) are in the same ratio to each other as the distances of those same spaces from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned; or, more simply, to the extent that a planet is farther from the point that is taken as the center of the world, it is less strongly urged to move about that point.It is therefore necessary that the cause of this weakening is either in the very body of the planet, and in a motive force placed therein, or right at the supposed center of the world.Now it is an axiom of the most common application in all of natural philosophy that of those things which occur at the same time and in the same manner, and which are always subject to like measurements, either one is the cause of the other or both are effects of the same cause.Just so, in this instance, the intension and remission of motion is always in the same ratio as the approach and recession from the center of the world.Thus, either that weakening will be the cause of the star's motion away from the center of the world, or the motion away will be the cause of the weakening, or both will  have some cause in common.But no one can think up some third concurrent thing that would be the common cause of these two, and in the following chapters it will become clear that we have no need of feigning any such cause, since the two are sufficient in themselves.Further, it is not in accord with nature that strength or weakness in longitudinal motion should be the cause of distance from the center.For distance from the center is prior both in thought and in nature to longitudinal motion.Indeed, longitudinal motion is never independent of distance from the center, since it requires a space in which to be performed, while distance from the center can be conceived without motion.Therefore, distance will be the cause of intensity of motion, and a greater or lesser distance will result in a greater or lesser amount of time.And since distance belongs to the class of related things, whose being depends upon end points, while relation itself, without respect to end points, has no efficacy, it therefore follows (as has been said) that the cause of the variation of intensity of motion inheres in one or the other of the end points.Now the body of a planet is never by itself made heavier in receding, nor lighter in approaching.Moreover, that an animate force, which is seated in the mobile body of the planet and imparts a motion to the heavenly body, undergoes intension and remission so many times without ever becoming tired or growing old,âthis will surely be absurd to say.Also, it is impossible to understand how this animate force could carry its body through the spaces of the world, since there are no solid orbs, as Tycho Brahe has proved.And on the other hand, a round body lacks such aids as wings or feet, by the moving of which the soul might carry its body through the aethereal air as birds do in the atmosphere, by some kind of pressure upon, and counter-pressure from, that air ^1.Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cause of this weakening and intension resides in the other endpoint, namely, in that point that is taken to be the center of the world, from which the distances are measured.So now, if the distance of the center of the world from the body of a planet  governs its slowness, and approach governs its speeding up, it is a necessary consequence that the source of motive power is at that supposed center of the world.And with this laid down, the manner in which the cause operates will also be clear.For it gives us to understand that the planets are moved rather in the manner of the steelyard or lever.For if the planet is moved with greater difficulty (and hence more slowly) by the power at the center when it is farther from the center, it is just as if I were to say that where the weight is farther from the fulcrum, it is thereby rendered heavier, not of itself, but by the power of the arm supporting it at that distance.And this is true, both of the steelyard or lever, and of the motion of the planets: that the weakening of power is in the ratio of the distances.But which body is it that is at the center?Is there none, as for Copernicus  when he is computing, and for Tycho in part?Is it the earth, as for Ptolemy and for Tycho in part?Or finally, is it the sun itself, as I, and Copernicus when he is speculating, would have it?This question I began to discuss in physical terms in Part 1.I there supposed as one of the principles what has now been expressly and geometrically proved in Chapter 32: that a planet is  moved less vigorously when it recedes from the point whence the eccentricity is computed.From this principle I presented a probable argument that the sun, rather than being at some other point occupied by no body, is at that point and at the center of the world (or the earth for Ptolemy).Allow me, then, to repeat that same probable argument, our foundation [for it] now demonstrated, in the present chapter.Then, you may remember, I demonstrated in the second part, that the phenomena at either end of the night follow beautifully if we reckon the oppositions of Mars according to the sun's apparent position.If this is done, then at the same time we set up the eccentricity and the distances from the very center of the sun's body, with the result that the sun itself again comes to be at the center of the world (for Copernicus), or at least at the center of the planetary system (for Tycho).But of these two arguments, one depends upon physical probability, and the other proceeds from possibility to actuality.And so in the third place I have postponed, because of its conceptual difficulty, demonstrating from the observations that we cannot avoid referring Mars to the apparent position of the sun, and drawing the line of apsides, which bisects the eccentric, directly through the sun's body, unless perhaps we wish to allow an eccentric such as will by no means be in accord with the parallax of the annual orb.Anyone who cannot tolerate the delay may read about this in chapter 52, and then may carry on here afterwards.For there nothing is assumed but the bare observations.You will find a similar proof in Part 5, from considerations of latitudes.Therefore, with the sun belonging in the center of the system, the source of motive power, from what has now been demonstrated, belongs in the sun, since it too has now been found to be in the center of the world.But indeed, if this very thing which I have just demonstrated a posteriori (from the observations) by a rather long deduction, if, I say, I had taken this as something to be demonstrated a priori (from the worthiness and eminence of the sun), so that the source of the world's life (which is visible in the motion of the heavens) is the same as the source of the light which forms the adornment of the entire machine, and which is also the source of the heat by which everything grows, I think I would have deserved an equal hearing.Let Tycho Brahe himself, or anyone who prefers to follow his general hypothesis of the second inequality, consider by how close a likeness to the truth this physically elegant combination has for the most part been accepted (since for him, too, this substitution of the apparent position of the sun brings the sun back to the center of the planetary system) yet to some extent recoils from his hypothesis.For it is obvious from what has been said that only one of the following can be true: either the power residing in the sun, which moves all the planets, by the same action moves the earth as well; or the sun, together with the planets linked to it through its motive force, is borne about the earth by some power which is seated in the earth.Now Tycho himself destroyed the notion of real orbs, and I in turn have in this Third Part irrefutably demonstrated that there is an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.From this it follows that the motion of the sun itself (if it is moved) is intensified and remitted according as it is nearer or farther from the earth, and hence it would follow that the sun is moved by the earth.But if, on the other hand, the earth is in motion, it too will be moved by the sun  with greater or less velocity according as it is nearer or farther from it, while the power in the body of the sun remains perpetually constant.Between these two possibilities, therefore, there is no intermediate.I myself agree with Copernicus, and allow that the earth is one of the  planets.Now it is true that the same objection may be raised against Copernicus concerning the moon, that I raised against Tycho concerning the five planets; namely, that it appears absurd for the moon to be moved by the earth, and to be associated with it and bound to it as well, so that it too, as a secondary planet, is swept around the sun by the sun.Nevertheless, I prefer to allow one moon, akin to the earth in its corporeal disposition2 (as I have shown in the Optics3) to be moved by a power seated in the earth but extended towards the sun, as will be described a little later in Ch.37, than to ascribe to that same earth as well the motion of the sun and of all the planets bound to it.But let us carry on in our consideration of this motive power residing in  the sun, and let us now again observe its very close kinship with light.}Since the perimeters of similar regular figures, even of circles, are to one another as their semidiameters, therefore as Î±Î´ is to Î±Îµ, so is the circumference of the circle described about Î± through Î´ to the circumference of the circle described about the same point Î± through Îµ. But as Î±Î´ is to Î±Îµ, so is the strength of the power at Îµ to the strength of the power at Î´, inversely, by what was proved in Chapter 32.Therefore, as the circle at Î´ is to the smaller circle at Îµ, so, inversely, is the power at Îµ to the power at Î´; that is, the power is weaker to the extent that it is more spread out, and stronger to the extent that it is more concentrated.Hence we understand that there is the same power in the whole circumference of the circle through Î´ as there is in the circumference of the smaller circle through Îµ. This was shown to be true of light in exactly the same way in the Astronomiae pars optica, Chapter 1 ^4.Therefore, in all respects and in all its attributes, the motive power from the sun coincides with light.And although this light of the sun cannot be the moving power itself, I leave it to others to see whether light perhaps is equivalent to a kind of instrument or vehicle, of which the moving power makes use.This seems gainsaid by the following: first, light is hindered by opaque things, and therefore if the moving power had light as a vehicle, rest of the moving bodies would follow upon darkness; again, light spreads spherically in straight lines, while the moving power, though spreading in straight lines, does so circularly; that is, it is exerted in but one region of the world, from east  to west, and not the opposite, not at the poles, and so on.But we shall perhaps be able to reply to these objections in the chapters immediately following.Finally, since there is just as much power in a larger and more distant circle as there is in a smaller and closer one, nothing of this power is lost in travelling from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the movable body.The emission, then, in the same manner as light, is immaterial, unlike odours, which are accompanied by a diminution of substance, and unlike heat from a hot furnace, or anything similar which fills the intervening space.The remaining possibility, then, is that, just as light, which lights the whole earth, is an immaterial species5 of that fire which is in the body of the sun, so this power which enfolds and bears the bodies of the planets, is an immaterial species residing in the sun itself, possessing inestimable strength, seeing that it is the primary activity of every motion in the universe.Since, therefore, this species of the power, exactly as the species of light (for which see the Astronomiae pars optica Ch.16), cannot be considered as dispersed throughout the intermediate space between the source and the mobile body, but is seen as collected in the body in proportion to the amount of the circumference the mobile body occupies, this power (or species) will therefore not be any geometrical body, but is like a variety of surface, just as light is.To generalize this, the species of things that emanate immaterially are not by that emanation extended through the dimensions of a body, although they arise from a body (as this one does from the body of the sun).Instead, they are extended according to that very law of emission: they are not bounded by the emanation itself, but just as the surfaces of things to be illuminated cause light to be considered as a kind of surface, because they receive and terminate its emission, so the bodies of things that are moved appear to bring it about that this moving power be considered as if a sort of geometrical body, because their whole masses terminate or receive this emission of the motive species, so that the species can exist or subsist nowhere in the world but in the bodies of the mobile things themselves.And, exactly like light, between the source and the movable thing it does not exist, but will have a quasi-existence.Moreover, at the same time, a reply can be made here to a possible objection.For it was said above that this motive power is extended throughout the space of the world, in some places more spread out and in others more concentrated, and that the intensification and remission of the motions of the planets are consequent upon this variation.Now, however, it has been said that this power is an immaterial species of its source, and never inheres in anything except a mobile subject, such as the body of a planet.But these appear to be contradictory: to lack matter and yet to be subject to geometrical dimensions; to be poured out throughout the whole world, and yet not to exist anywhere but where there is something movable.The reply is this: although the motive power is not anything material, nevertheless, since it is designed for carrying matter (namely, the body of a planet), it is not free from geometrical laws, at least on account of this material action of carrying things about.Nor is there need for more, for we see that those motions are carried out in space and time, and that this power arises and emanates from the source through the space of the world, all of which are geometrical entities.So this power should indeed be subject to other geometrical necessities.But lest I appear to philosophize with excessive insolence, I shall propose  to the reader the clearly authentic example of light, since it also makes its nest  in the sun, thence to break forth into the whole world as a companion to this motive power.Who, I ask, will say that light is something material?Nevertheless, it carries out its operations with respect to place, suffers alteration,7 is reflected and refracted, and assumes quantities so as to be dense or rare, and to be capable of being taken as a surface wherever it falls upon something illuminable.Now just as it is said in optics, light too, and this motive power as well, does not exist in the intermediate space between the source and the illuminable, even though it passed through it, but quasi-existed there.Moreover, although light itself does indeed flow forth in no time, while this power creates motion in time, nonetheless the way in which both do so is the same, if you consider them correctly.Light manifests those things which are proper to it instantaneously, but so far as it is connected with matter, it too requires time.It illuminates a surface in a moment, because here matter need not undergo any alteration, for all illumination takes place according to surfaces, or at least as if a property of surfaces and not as a property of corporeality as such.On the other hand, light bleaches colors in time, since here it acts upon matter qua matter, making it hot and expelling the contrary cold which is embedded in the body's matter and is not on its surface.In precisely the same manner, this moving power perpetually and without any interval of time is present from the sun wherever there is a suitable movable body, for it receives nothing from the movable body to cause it to be there.On the other hand, it causes motion in time, since the movable body is material.Or if it seems better, frame the comparison in this manner: light is  constituted for illumination, and it is just as certain that power is constituted for motion.Light does everything that can be done to achieve the greatest illumination; nonetheless, it does not happen that color is most greatly illuminated.For color intermingles its own peculiar species with the illumination of light, thus forming some third entity.In like manner, there is no slowing in the moving power to prevent the planet's having as much speed as it has itself, but the planet's speed is not therefore that great, since something intervening prevents that, namely, some sort of matter possessed by the surrounding aether, or the disposition of the movable body itself to rest (others might say, \"weight,\" but I do not entirely approve of that, except, indeed, where the earth is concerned).It is the tempering effect of these, together with the weakening of the motive power, that determines a planet's periodic time.Chapter 34The body of the sun is magnetic, and rotates in its space.Concerning that power that is closely attached to the bodies of the planets and pulls them, we have already said how it is formed, how it is akin to light, and what it is in its metaphysical being.Next, we should contemplate the deeper nature of its source, shown by the outflowing species (acting as an archetype).For it may appear that there lies hidden in the body of the sun something divine, which may be compared to our soul, from which flows that species driving the planets around, just as from the soul of someone throwing pebbles a species of motion comes to inhere in the pebbles thrown by him, even when he who threw them removes his hand from them.And to those who proceed soberly, other reflections will soon be provided.Now because the power that is extended from the sun to the planets moves  them in a circular course around the immovable body of the sun, this cannot happen, or be conceived in thought, in any other way than this, that the power traverses the same path along which it carries the other planets.This has been observed to some extent in catapults and all violent motions.Thus, Fracastoro and others, relying on a story told by the most ancient Egyptians, spoke with little probability when they said that perchance some of the planets, their orbits being deflected gradually beyond the poles of the world, would thus afterwards move in a path opposite to the rest and to their modern course ^1.For it is much more likely that the bodies of the planets are always borne in that direction in which the power emanating from the sun tends.But this species is immaterial, proceeding from its body out to this distance without the passing of any time, and is in all other respects like light.Therefore, it is not only required by the nature of the species, but likely in itself owing to this kinship with light, that along with the particles of its body or source it too is divided up, and when any particle of the solar body moves towards some part of the world, the particle of the immaterial species that from the beginning of creation corresponded to that particle of the body also always moves towards the same part.If this were not so, it would not be a species, and would come down from the body not in straight but in curved lines.Since the species is moved in a circular course, in order thereby to confer motion upon the planets, the body of the sun, or source, must move with it, not, of course, from space to space in the worldâfor I have said, with Copernicus, that the body of the sun remains in the center of the worldâbut upon its center or axis, both immobile, its parts moving from place to place, while the whole body remains in the same place.In order that the force of the analogical argument may be that much more evident, I would like you to recall, reader, the demonstration in optics that vision occurs through the emanation of small sparks of light2 toward the eye from the surfaces of the seen object.Now imagine that some orator in a great crowd of people, encircling him in an orb,3 turns his face, or his whole body along with it, once around.Those of the audience to whom he turns his eyes directly also see his eyes, but those who stand behind him then lack the view of his eyes.But when he turns himself around, he turns his eyes around to everyone in the orb.Therefore, in a very short interval of time, all get a glimpse of his eyes.This they get by the arrival of a small spark of light or species of color descending from the eyes of the orator to the eyes of the spectators.Thus by turning his eyes around in the small space in which his head is located, he carries around along with it the rays of the spark of light in the very large  orb in which the eyes of the spectators all around are situated.For unless the spark of light went around, his spectators would not be recipients of his eyes' glance.Here you see clearly that the immaterial species of light either is moved around or stands still along with that of which it is the species either moving or standing still ^4.Therefore, since the species of the source, or the power moving the planets, rotates about the center of the world, I conclude with good reason, following this example, that that of which it is the species, the sun, also rotates.However, the same thing is also shown by the following argument.Motion that is local and subjected to time cannot inhere in a bare immaterial species, since such a species is incapable of receiving an effect of an applied motion unless the received motion is non-temporal, just as the power is immaterial.Also, although it has been proved that this moving power rotates, it cannot be allowed to have infinite speed (for then it would seem that the power will also impart infinite speed to the bodies), and therefore it completes its rotation in some period of time.Therefore, it cannot carry out this motion by itself, and it is as a consequence necessary that it is moved only because the body upon which it depends is moved.By the same argument, it appears to be a correct conclusion that there does not exist within the boundaries of the solar body anything immaterial by whose rotation the species descending from that immaterial something also rotates.For again, local motion which takes time is not correctly attributed to anything immaterial.It therefore remains that the body of the sun itself rotates in the manner described above, indicating the poles of the zodiac by the  poles of its rotation (by a line extended from the center of the body to the fixed stars through the poles), and indicating the ecliptic by the greatest circle of its body, thus furnishing a natural cause for these astronomical entities.Further, we see that the individual planets are not carried along with equal  swiftness at every distance from the sun, nor is the speed of all of them at their various distances equal.For Saturn takes 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 23 months, earth 12, Venus 8Â½, and Mercury 3.Nevertheless, it follows from what has been said that every orb of power emanating from the sun (in the space embraced by the lowest, Mercury, as well as that embraced by the highest, Saturn) is twisted around with a whirl equal to that which spins the solar body, with an equal period.(There is nothing absurd in this statement, for the emanating power is immaterial, and by its own nature would be capable of infinite speed if it were possible to impress a motion upon it from elsewhere, for then it could be impeded neither by weight, which it lacks, nor by the obstruction of the corporeal medium.)It is consequently clear that the planets are ill-suited to emulate the swiftness of the motive power.For Saturn is less receptive than Jupiter, since its returns are slower, while the orb of power at the path of Saturn returns with the same swiftness as the orb of power at the path of Jupiter, and so on in order, all the way to Mercury, which, by example of the superior planets, doubtless will move more slowly than the power that pulls it.It is therefore necessary that the nature of the planetary globes be material, from an inherent property, arising from the origin of things, to be inclined to rest or  to the privation of motion ^5.When the tension between these things leads to a fight, that planet which is placed in a weaker power overcomes it more, and is moved more slowly by it; that which is closer to the sun overcomes it less.This analogy shows that there is in all planets, even in the lowest, Mercury, a material force of disengaging itself somewhat from the orb of the sunâs power.From this it is concluded that the rotation of the solar body anticipates  considerably the periodic times of all the planets; therefore, it must rotate in its space at least faster than once in a three-monthsâ span.However, in my Mysterium Cosmographicum I pointed out that there is about the same ratio between the semidiameters of the sunâs body and the orb of Mercury as there is between the semidiameters of the body of the earth and the orb of the moon.Hence, you may plausibly conclude that the period of the orb of Mercury would have the same ratio to the period of the body of the sun as the period of the orb of the moon has to the period of the body of the earth.And the semidiameter of the orb of the moon is sixty times the semidiameter of the body of the earth, while the period of the orb of the moon (or the month) is a little less than thirty times the period of the body of the earth (or day), and thus the ratio of the distances is double the ratio of the periodic times.Therefore, if the doubled ratio also holds for the sun and Mercury, since the diameter of the sun's body is about one sixtieth of the diameter of Mercury's orb, the time of rotation of the solar globe will be one thirtieth of 88 days, which is the period of Mercury's orb.Hence it is likely that the sun rotates in about three days.You may, on the other hand, prefer to prescribe the sun's diurnal period in such a way that the diurnal rotation of the earth is dispensed by the diurnal rotation of the sun, by some sort of magnetic force.I would certainly not object.Such a rapid rotation appears not to be alien to that body in which lies the first activation of every motion.This opinion (on the rotation of the solar body as the cause of the motion for the other planets) is beautifully confirmed by the example of the earth and the moon.For the chief, monthly motion of the moon, by the force of the demonstrations used in Chapters 32 and 33, is entirely derived from the earth as its source (for what the sun is for the rest of the planets there, the earth is for the moon in this demonstration).Consider, therefore, how our earth occasions the motion of the moon: while this our earth, and its immaterial species along with it, rotates twenty nine and one half times about its axis, at the moon this emitted species can drive it around only once in the same time, in (of course) the same direction in which the earth leads it.Here, by the way, is a marvel: in any given time the center of the moon traverses twice as long a line about the center of the earth as any place on the surface of the earth beneath the great circle of the equator.For if equal spaces were measured out in equal times, the moon ought to return in sixty days, since the size of its orb is sixty times the size of the earth's globe.This is surely because there is so much force in the immaterial species of the earth, while the lunar body is doubtless of great rarity and weak resistance.Thus, to remove your bewilderment, consider that on the principles we have supposed it would necessarily follow that if the moon were not to resist, by its material force, the motion impressed from outside by the earth, the moon would be carried at exactly the same speed as the earth's immaterial species, that is, with the earth itself, and  would complete its circuit in 24 hours, in which the earth also completes its circuit.For even if the tenuity of the earth's species is great at the distance of 60 semidiameters, the ratio of one to nothing is still the same as the ratio of sixty to nothing.Hence the immaterial species of the earth would prevail completely, if the moon did not resist.Here, one might inquire of me, what sort of body I consider the sun to be, from which this motive species descends.I would ask him to proceed under the guidance of a further analogy, and urge him to inspect more closely the example of the magnet brought up a little earlier, whose power resides in the entire body of the magnet, grows with its mass, and is itself also divided when the magnet is diminished.So in the sun the moving power appears so much stronger that it seems likely that its body is of all [those in the world] the most dense.And the power of attracting iron is spread out in an orb from the magnet so  that there exists a certain orb within which iron is attracted, but more strongly so as the iron comes nearer into the embrace of that orb.In exactly the same way the power moving the planets is propagated from the sun in an orb, and is weaker in the more remote parts of the orb.The magnet, however, does not attract with all its parts, but has filaments  (so to speak) or straight fibers (seat of the motor power) extended throughout its length, so that is a little strip of iron is placed in a middle position between the heads of the magnet at the side, the magnet does not attract it, but only directs it parallel to its own fibers.Thus it is credible that there is in the sun no force whatever attracting the planets, as there is in the magnet, (for then they would approach the sun until they were quite joined with it), but only a directing force, and consequently that is has circular fibers all set up in the same direction, which are indicated by the zodiac circleTherefore, as the sun forever turns itself, the motive force or the outflowing of the species from the sunâs magnetic fibers, diffused through all the distances of the planets, also rotates in an orb, and does so in the same time as the sun, just as when a magnet is moved about, the magnetic power is also moved, and the iron along with it, following the magnetic force.The example of the magnet I have hit upon is a very pretty one, and entirely  suited to the subject; indeed, it is little short of being the very truth.So why should I speak of the magnet as if it were an example?For, by the demonstration of the Englishman William Gilbert,6 the earth itself is a big magnet, and is said by the same author, a defender of Copernicus, to rotate once a day, just as I conjecture about the sun.And because of this very thing, that it has magnetic fibers intersecting the line of its motion at right angles, those fibers therefore lie in various circles about the poles of the earth parallel to its motion.I am therefore absolutely within my rights to state that the moon is carried along by the rotation of the earth and the motion of its magnetic power, only thirty times slower.I know that the earthâs filaments and its motion indicate the equator, while  the circuit of the moon is generally related to the zodiac â on this point there will be more in Chapter 37 and Part 5.With this one exception, everything fits: the earth is intimately related to the lunar period, just as the sun is to that of  the other planets.And just as the planets are eccentric with respect to the sun, so is the moon with respect to the earth.So it is certain that the earth is looked upon by the moonâs mover as a kind of pole star (so to speak), just as the sun is looked upon by the movers belonging to the rest of the planets, for which see Chapter 38.It is therefore plausible, since the earth moves the moon through its species and is a magnetic body, while the sun moves the planets similarly through an emitted species, that the sun is likewise a magnetic body.Chapter 35Whether the motion from the sun, like its light, is subject to privation in the planets through occultations ^1.This is a good time for me to take up the objections raised in Chapter 33, where to the kinship of light and motive power were opposed, first, the mutual occultations of the celestial bodies, and then, the different [manner of] emanation of the species of the two.And concerning the first, it is worthy of consideration whether, just as one opaque body intercepts another's sunlight, mobile bodies similarly impede one another in motion when they lie in line with the sun.If so, light would clearly be the vehicle or instrument of the motive power.It might appear that in order to avoid this as much as possible, God introduced the relative inclinations of all the eccentrics, deviations from the ecliptic, and transpositions of the nodes, as well as the proportions of the bodies and the attenuation of shadows in a cone.And since it would not be possible completely to prevent the stars' occasionally lining up with the sun, it is tempting  to suppose that the very slow motions of the apsides and nodes (which are, as it were, a kind of aberration of the epicycles from their periodic times) derive their origin thence.But it is answered, first, that the analogy between light and motive power is not to be disturbed by rashly confusing their properties.Light is impeded by the opaque, but is not impeded by a body, because light is light, and does not act upon the body but on the surface (or as if on the surface).Power acts upon the body without respect to its opacity.Therefore, since it is not correlated with the opaque, it will likewise not be impeded by the opaque.On this account I would nearly separate light from moving power, unless I were to come upon examples in nature which leave to the rays of light, even when impeded, a certain efficacy in those locations where their entry is prohibited.But I am not chiefly concerned here with the association of light with the motive power.Instead, in order to dissolve this suspicion that the motions are impeded, let us  take another example from the magnet.Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there.Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate.But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet.It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it.And although it is impeded by the interposition of the iron plate, this too belongs to the magnetic nature, and it immediately drinks up the magnet's power and uses it as if it were its own.Therefore, in order that we may deny that the motion of the celestial bodies is impeded by central conjunctions of two of them, we must say that the nature of the sun differs from the nature of the rest of the celestial bodies more than the nature of the magnet differs from the nature of iron.Also, we must deny that the planets drink up the power all at once from the sun in the same way as the iron drinks it from the magnet.The question of whether they drink up any of it at all, I defer to Chapter 57.In respect to the likelihood of the cause of the apogees' motion, it proves  nothing concerning this common solar power being impeded by occultation ^2.For the motion of the apogees could be quite different; for instance, it could have an animate origin.You will find a certain obscure opinion on this point below in Chapter 57 ^3.Further, if the motion of the apogees were to arise because the motion of the planets around the sun is impeded by the occultation of the motive species emanating from the sun, the motion in longitude would be slowed, either by a progressive motion of latitude (by which the apogees would move back) or equally by slowing of the latitudinal motion.Thus, the apogees would stand still, although the observations testify that they move forward.But the question whether, once the sun is preserved as the source of motion, the motions proper to the celestial bodies are impeded by occultation,4 will also be discussed in Chapter 57.Chapter 36By what measure the motive power from the sun is attenuated as it spreads through the world.There follows another, rather more difficult objection, arising from the second argument that was raised in Chapter 33 against the kinship of light and motive power, which seems irreconcilably at odds with our study of immaterial species.This objection wearied me for a long time without offering any prospect of solution.It was demonstrated in Chapter 32 that the intension and remission of the planets' motion is in simple proportion to the distances.It appears, however, that the power emanating from the sun should be intensified and remitted in the duplicate or triplicate ratio of the distances or lines of efflux.Therefore, the intension and remission of the planets' motion will not be a result of the attenuation of the power emanating from the sun.The logical consequence appears to be proved in the following manner, for light as well as for  moving power; however, discussions of light are clearer.The reader should read in \"motive power\".Initially, let Î± be any point on the sun's body.It will therefore spread out its rays to every orb, and from a demonstration in optics, as the amplitude of the greater spherical surface Î³, considered as an imaginary terminus for those rays, is to the amplitude of the smaller, Î², so will the density of light at the smaller orb Î² be to its density at the greater Î³.Next, let Î´Îµ be any luminous great circle on the body of the sun.Thus its individual points, of which there are an infinity, spread out rays to the individual hemispheres Î² and Î³ in the same ratio.And the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the circle at the shorter distance (i.e., the angle Î´Î²Îµ) is to the apparent magnitude at the greater distance (i.e., the angle Î´Î³Îµ), conversely, as the longer distance Î±Î³ from such a circular line (which at a distance appears straight) is to the shorter Î´Î².So, since this diameter appears longer from the nearby point Î² than from the distant point Î³, in the same ratio, while the radiation belonging to any given point is denser at a nearby point Î² than at a distant point Î³, it is therefore apparent that the density of radiation of the circle at the nearby point Î² will have to the density of radiation at the distant point Î³ the [inverse of the] duplicate ratio of Î±Î² to Î±Î³.Thirdly, let Î´Î±Îµ be the apparent disc of the sun's body, and since similar surfaces (as are the apparent circular discs here) are in the duplicate ratio of their diameters, while the apparent diameters of the sun are in the simple inverse ratio of the distances Î±Î³, Î±Î², the circular discs will therefore appear in the duplicate ratio of the distances Î±Î³, Î±Î².But since the radiation of the circle Î´Îµ at Î³ and Î² was just proved to be in the duplicate ratio of the distances Î±Î², Î±Î³, while both are causes of the density [of radiation], it appears that the radiation of the disc, with respect to density or strength, is in the triplicate ratio of the distances Î±Î³, Î±Î².For example, if the distances Î±Î³ to Î±Î² were as 2 to 1, the radiations of the point at Î±Î³ and Î±Î² would be as 1 to 2, with respect to the density of light, and the apparent diameters of circles would be 1 at Î³ and 2 at Î².Therefore, the radiation of the diameter of the circle Î´Îµ would be 1 at Î³ and 4 at Î². But the discs are in the duplicate ratio of the diameters.Therefore the apparent magnitude of the disc at Î³ would be 1, and at Î², 4, as if you were to say that the disc Î´Î±Îµ when seen from Î² appears to contain four times as many points as when seen from Î³. Any of these points illuminates twice as densely at Î² than at Î³. Therefore, when the ratios are compounded, the density of radiation of the whole disc Î´Î±Îµ at Î³ would have to the density of radiation of the whole disc Î´Î±Îµ at Î² the ratio 1 to 8.It does not trouble us here that we are reckoning from the sun's apparent disc, although it is a spherical surface.For the ratio of equally many things to each other mutually is the same.But the spherical surface was demonstrated by Archimedes to be four times the area of the greatest circle described in the sphere.Therefore, a body at Î³, twice as far away as at Î², should have appeared to be fully eight times as obscurely illuminated at Î³ as at Î², not just twice.For it seems that the brightness of the rays ought to be intensified because of the fact that bodies appear to be magnified when they approach, as [for example] Venus, when at the perigee of the epicycle, defines a more evident shadow around bodies than at apogee.Therefore, by the force of the analogy which we have instituted between light and motive force, the same should be thought to apply to the motive force.To this objection, I answer decisively, that in the initial supposition involving the point I made a false assumption.Even though I did indeed say something like that in the Optics, you should bear in mind that I was speaking of optics, whose points and lines are not quite indivisibles.For, as concerns the point, since it has no magnitude, while the rays are amplified with the magnitudes of bodies, it follows that the radiation of a point in itself is nothing, and hence what has no radiation has no greater or lesser density.Thus the initial assumption of the ratio of distances Î±Î² to Î±Î³ collapses.Rather, because of this very thing, we say that any point shines more strongly or weakly to the extent that that point designates to us a greater or lesser quantity.In the second supposition, concerning the circle, and the third, concerning the disc, there are two false assumptions.The first is that a mathematical circle, lacking breadth, is supposed to shine.For it can no more shine itself than can the point from whose motion the circle is supposed to be generated.You are no closer to having a surface when you posit a line of three stadia1 than you are in positing a line of three feet.Second, it is supposed that the optical magnification of the diameter or of the disc adds to the strength of the rays, although this is but a deception of the visual faculty, and belongs to the genus of theoretical entities, which lack any efficacy.The physical identity of the circle Î´Îµ, the surface Î´Î±Îµ (when light is in question) and the body Î´Îµ (when power is in question) remains the same whether it is viewed from Î³ or from Î², and will always act the same and have the same effect, spreading the same amount of power or light in the more diffuse orb Î³ as in the more compact orb Î². Nothing is lost in the journey: the entire species carries through to any distance, however remote.It is attenuated only in the extensions of the spheres, so that in the individual points of the spheres, such as Î³ and Î², it is rarer in the former, and denser in the latter, in the inverse ratio of the distances Î±Î² to Î±Î³.This is the sole cause of the weakening, not the diminishing of the source Î´Îµ, which in fact does not happen, being but an optical illusion.Indeed, if I might argue from Euclid's Optics here, less light arrives at the nearer, Î², than at the more remote, for the reason that at Î² a smaller circle bounds the visible hemisphere of the luminous body Î´Îµ than at Î³. Therefore, not so many particles of the sun Î´Îµ can be seen from Î² as from Î³. But this is quite imperceptible, hard to express [even] in enormous numbers.And I, after giving this answer to myself, am having a good laugh at my wretched alarm arising from this obscure business.But the objection can rebound in the opposite direction, thus.If there is the same amount of light spread out in a large sphere as there is gathered together in a small sphere, there will not be the same amount of power in both places, for power is not considered orbicularly in a sphere as light is, but in the circle in which the planet proceeds.Thus, the magnetic filaments of the sun were supposed, above, to be set up only in longitude, not towards the poles or in other directions.The answer is that the cause of light and motive power is exactly the same, and there is a deception in the reasoning.For in light, the  rays do not flow out solely from the individual points and circles of the body to the corresponding points and circles of the sphere.Thus, the rays from Î³ do not come only from Î± (by which arrangement it would be impossible to ascribe a density to light in the spheres, since it would have no quantity in its origin, descending as it does from a point).Instead, the rays flow out from the whole hemisphere of the lucid body to the individual points of the imaginary spherical surface: thus, the rays from both Î´ and Îµ flow out to Î³. The same thing takes place likewise with power.Even though the magnetic filaments of the solar body are ordered according to zodiacal longitude, and even though there is but a single great circle of the sun's body beneath the zodiac or ecliptic, and roughly beneath the orbit of the planet, and (finally) even though the other smaller circles (which are compacted to the size of points beneath the poles) are subordinated to their corresponding circles in the sphere of the planet, nevertheless, the rays from all the filaments of the solar body (standing up from one hemisphere of the body) flow down and converge on the individual points of the path of any of the planets as well as on those poles that are above the poles of the sun's body, and the body of the planet is transported according to the measure of the density of this entire species compounded of all the filaments.It does not, however, follow that just as the sun shines equally in all directions, the planets, too, as you might fear, are moved indiscriminately in all directions.For the magnetic filaments of the sun, considered in themselves, do not move, but only inasmuch as the sun, rotating very rapidly in its space, carries the filaments around, and with them the moving species spreading abroad from them.Therefore the planet will not go backwards, because the sun always rotates forwards.The planet will not go to the poles (even though there might be some of the species from the sun's body at those points) because the filaments of the solar body are not extended in the direction of the poles, nor does the sun rotate in that direction, but rather in the direction in which its filaments urge it.On these suppositions, it is so far from being the case that the planets are carried towards the poles that there is instead a single region of the zodiac, the mean between the poles, through which all planets of necessity would move in longitude without deflection, if they were to cease their own proper motions (of which see Chapter 38 below).For the species of the solar hemisphere which takes up a post at some point of the zodiac, such as the point Î¶ in the present diagram, is the total of the filaments of the semicircle all tending in the same direction in concert, as, from [the region from] Î¸ through Îº, from Î» through Î¼, etc ^2.But when you move off towards the poles of the world, as at Î·, then because one pole Î½ of the sun's body, and the complete circles Î»Î¼ that surround the pole Î½, are appropriated under the purview of Î·Î¼, the species is made up of filaments tending in opposite directions, for the opposite parts Î» and Î¼ of the circles move in opposite directions.Therefore that species Î¸Î·Î¼ descending near the poles is less well adapted to the motion carrying the planets along.Chapter 37How the power moving the moon may be constituted.Since in Chapter 34, in passing, I made mention of the motion of the moon, it would be appropriate to treat the matter in greater detail, so that no reservation introduced by the moon might deflect the reader into withholding his ready assent from me on the entire treatise; so that it might instead be marvelously confirmed, by the clearest consideration of the lunar motion; and finally, to ensure that the physical aspects of astronomy are treated fully in this book.For even though there are a few things in the theory of the moon that must be deferred, as they are to be treated differently or explained in more detail, they nevertheless will have their origin here.After long and painstaking observations of the moon in every position in relation to the sun, Tycho Brahe expressed the opinion that in the moon, besides the anomaly of the epicycle, and besides that monthly anomaly which was also known to Ptolemy, the mean motion itself (so named in relation to these two inequalities) is not yet quite \"mean.\"That is, it intensifies at the conjunctions and oppositions with the sun, and is remitted at the quadratures.Thus, even if it were undisturbed by epicycles, the moon itself, even though moving on a circle concentric with the earth, would move around  nonuniformly ^1.Let S be the body of the sun, M the orb of Mercury, V of Venus, T of the earth, P of Mars, and so on.And let all of them always move from right to left when in the upper part of the diagram.Now let CLOF be the orb of the moon, O the moon at opposition, C at conjunction, L, F at quadratures, and let CLOF remain for now a concentric described about the earth at T, and let it move in the direction OFCL.The question is, by what cause is the moon made to move more swiftly about T at C, O than at F, L, since we have just now mentally removed the eccentricity and the epicycles.Here, I know, the reader expects me to say that it is swifter at O because at that place its motion is in the same direction as the motion of all the planets.But this is not the true cause.For in that case, what would happen at C is what in fact happens, that the moon, in its compounded motion, is slowest, since its proper motion FCL resists considerably this common rightward motion ^2.For it should be noted that the moon, from point C on its orb, is borne less in the leftward direction L than the earth is borne to the right on its orb.Therefore, the moon, by a motion compounded of its proper motion and that which it has in common with the earth, also always moves to the left when above, as when the earth is at Î´, but here, when the earth is down low at T, it is carried to the right, but slowly at C and swiftly at O. A motion of this sort is expressed approximately by the spiral lines set out here.But perhaps you are expecting me to say instead that this phenomenon arises from the sun's motive power being weaker at O and stronger at C?Much less will I say this.For I would thus make it slow at O and C, and fast at F, L, which is contrary to what is desired.For if it is propelled weakly at O, it therefore is slow, and if it is held back more strongly at C, so that its tendency to move in the opposite direction from C to L is less, it will therefore again move slowly from C to L. Thus it was not correct for us to free the moon from the earth and commit it to the sun.This would cause it at length to wander away from the earth, just as the apogees wander from their places.It would be preferable to attribute to the earth a force that retains the moon, like a sort of chain, which would be there even if the moon did not circle the earth at all.On this supposition, the moon is, as it were, in the same boat with the earth, in the same power of the sun, and now, as if freed from this motion from the sun, it is rotated separately by the earth.Therefore, I consider the cause of the swiftness at O and C to be none other than this, that the earth T derives its power of moving the moon from the sun S, and preserves it by the continuity of the line TS.Thus SCTO can properly be called the \"diameter of power\" since these two (T and S) are the sources of the entire motion.On this supposition, that monthly inequality known to Ptolemy also will follow.For if the power coming from the same source T is stronger at C, O than at F, L, then if the apogee is near C, O, there is a greater loss of speed than if the apogee were at F, L. Thus when going from the apogee at O or C the equations at F, L are greater than when going from the apogee at F, L to the conjunctions and oppositions O, C.You see, then, that these physical speculations are so devised that they can even account for the phenomena of the moon.The moon is not driven tocircle the earth primarily by the sun, but by a power lying hidden in the earth itself, and casting forth its immaterial species to the body of the moon, but more strongly along the line that connects the centers of the sun (the primary source) and the earth.It is, however, hard to explain more clearly how that diameter comes to be more powerful.For neither the sun's power nor the earth's, going out to themoon, is any swifter when the moon falls on that diameter.That the rotations of these bodies (and therefore also of the species) are uniform and forever constant, is a highly reasonable presumption.There remains only the possibility described here, that the power is indeed not swifter, but more robust, when it emanates from the earth in the directions nearer to the line ST, for the reason that it was originally drawn off from the sun to the earth along that line.Nevertheless, it is the sun which, either immediately or through that faculty which effects annual motion for the earth, is the principal director of the motion which the earth confers upon the moon.This is demonstrated chiefly by the moon's making its circuit beneath the zodiac, like the annual circuit of the centre of the earth, although the earth's diurnal motion, which confers the monthly motion upon the moon, takes place beneath the equator.Chapter 38Besides the common motive force of the sun, the planets are endowed with an inherent force [vis insita], and the motion of each of them is compounded of the two causes.I have spoken of the origin of the motion which rotates the planets around the sun or the moon around the earth; that is, I have spoken of the natural causes of the circle which in the theories of the planets is called either eccentric or concentric, according to the various intentions of the authors.Now, some thing must be said of the natural cause of the eccentricity, or in the particular hypothesis of Copernicus, of the epicycle on a concentric.For the moving power from the sun has hitherto been uniform, having different degrees only at various amplitudes of the circles.Its innate quality is such that if a planet were to remain at the same distance from the sun it would be carried around perfectly uniformly, and would not experience any intension or remission of the solar motion.The modicum of nonuniformity perceived in the working of this power arises from the planet's having been transposed from one distance from the sun to another, so that it encounters one or another degree of strength of this power from the sun.The question therefore arises, if, as Brahe demonstrated, there are no solid orbs, how does the planet come to ascend from and descend towards the sun?Can this, too, really come from the sun?My answer is that it is to some extent from the sun, and to some extent not from the sun.Examples of natural things, and this hitherto disparaged kinship of  celestial things for terrestrial ones, cry out that in a simple body the operations which are more general are simpler, while the variables, if any (such as, in the motion of the planets, the varying distance from the sun, or the eccentricity), arise from the concurrence of extrinsic causes.Thus, in a river, the simple property of water is to descend towards the  centre of the earth.But because its path is not direct, it flows in to those places where it finds a lower bed, stagnates where it meets with level ground, and is carried along with a roar where it comes upon steeper slopes; there is a place where it may be spun into whirlpools, if in a swift drop it should dash into projecting rocks.Where water itself, by its inherent force, endeavors to do nothing but descend towards the centre of the earth, a simple action by a simple property, nevertheless, flow and stagnation and waves and whirlpools and every variety [of phenomena] arise from the causes described, which are adventitious and accidental.Particularly happy and better accommodated to our inquiry are the phenomena exhibited by the propulsion of boats.Imagine a cable or rope hanging high up across a river, suspended from both banks, and a pulley running along the rope, holding, by another rope, a skiff1 floating in the river.If the ferryman in the skiff, otherwise at rest, fastens his rudder or oar in the right manner, the skiff, carried crosswise by the simple force of the downward-moving river, is transported from one bank to the other, as the pulley runs along the cable above.On broader rivers they make the skiffs go in circles, send them hither and thither, and play a thousand tricks, without touching the bottom or the banks, but by the use of the oar alone, directing the singular and most simple flow of the river to their own ends.In very much the same manner, the power moving out from the sun into the world through the species is a kind of rapid torrent, which sweeps along all the planets, as well as, perhaps, the entire aethereal air, from west to east.It is not itself suited to attracting bodies to the sun or driving them further from it, which would be an infinitely troublesome task.It is therefore necessary that the planets themselves, rather like the skiffs, have their own motive powers, as if they had riders [vectores] or ferrymen, by whose forethought they  accomplish not only the approach to the sun and recession from the sun, but also (and this might be called the second argument) the declinations of latitudes; and as if from one bank to the other (that is, from north to south and back), travel across this river (which itself only follows the course of the ecliptic) from north to south and back.It is certain from what has been said above that the power which comes from the sun is simple.But now, the eccentrics of the planets do not just decline from the ecliptic, but go in various directions, intersecting one another and the ecliptic.Therefore, other causes are conjoined with the motive power from the sun.Chapter 39By what path and by what means the powers seated in the planets ought to move them, in order that the planet's circular orbit, such as is commonly thought to exist, be brought about in the aethereal air.And so, let these points of great certainty in what has been demonstrated be  axioms for us.First, that the body of a planet is inclined by nature to rest in  every place where it is put by itself.Second, that it is transported from one longitudinal position to another by that power which originates in the sun.Third, if the distance of the planet from the sun were not altered, a circular path would result from this transport.Fourth, supposing the same planet to be in turn at two distances from the sun, remaining there for one whole circuit, the periodic times will be in the duplicate ratio of the distances or magnitude of the circles.Fifth, the bare and solitary power residing in the body of a planet itself is not sufficient for transporting its body from place to place, since it lacks feet, wings, and feathers by which it might press upon the aethereal air.And nevertheless, sixth, the approach and recession of a planet to and from the sun arises from that power which is proper to the planet.All these axioms are agreeable to nature in themselves, and have been demonstrated previously.Now let us work with geometrical figures in order to see what laws will be  required to represent any desired planetary orbit.Let the orbit of the planet be a circle, as has been believed until now, and let it be eccentric with respect to the sun, the source of power.Let that eccentric CD be described about center B with radius BC, and on it let BC be the line of apsides, A the sun, and BA the eccentricity.Let the eccentric be divided into any number of equal parts, beginning from the line of apsides at C, and let the ends of these parts be connected with A. Therefore, CA, DA, EA, FA, GA, HA, will be the distances of the end points of the equal parts from the source of power.Now with center Î², radius Î²Î³, equal to AB, let the epicycle Î³Î´ be described, divided into as many equal parts as the eccentric, beginning from Î³, and let the line Î³Î² be extended so as to make Î²Î± equal to BC, and let the point Î± be connected with the end points of the equal parts of the epicycle, by the lines Î³Î±, Î´Î±, ÎµÎ±, Î¶Î±, Î·Î±, Î¸Î±.These lines will be respectively equal to the distances drawn to the eccentric from A, this having been demonstrated above in Chapter 2.Next, with center Î± and radius Î´Î±, let the arc Î´Î¹Î¸ be described, intersecting the diameter Î³Î¶ at Î¹ and about the same center Î±, with radius Î±Îµ, let the arc ÎµÎ»Î· be described, intersecting the diameter Î³Î¶ at Î», and let the end points of the parts equidistant from the aphelion of the epicycle Î³ be connected by the lines Î´Î¸, ÎµÎ·, which will intersect the diameter at Îº, Î¼, so that Î±Î´ or Î±Î¹ is longer than Î±Îº, and Î±Îµ or Î±Î» longer than Î±Î¼.If it were possible for the planet to move on a perfect epicycle by its inherent force,1 and for its orbit at the same time to be a perfect circle, then we would have to consider similar arcs to be swept out in the same times, on the eccentric and on the epicycle.Consequently, it would now immediately  become clear by what means, and by what measure, the distance Î±Î¹ would be made equal to AD.For since Î±Î¹ and Î±Î¸ are equal, when the planet moves from Î³ to Î¸ the distance Î±Î¸ necessarily and without any special contrivance comes out right, equal to AD.But aside from one appearing to be in conflict with the fifth axiom, who  claims that the planet moves locally from Î³ to Î¸ by its inherent force, many additional absurdities are also involved.For let AN be drawn parallel to BD, and let AN be equal to BD, and about center N let an epicycle be described which shall go through D. Now since CD is a perfect circle, the same angles are swept out by the planet D about the center of the eccentric B as by the center of the epicycle N about the center of the sun A (through the equivalence demonstrated in Chapter 2), as long as the diameter of the epicycle ND with the planet at D always remains parallel to AB with respect to its position in the world.Therefore, the speed of the center of the epicycle N about the sun A would be made the same as the speed of the planet D about the center of the eccentric B, so that those motions would be intensified at the same time and remitted at the same time.And since intension and remission depends upon greater or less distance of the body  of the planet from the sun, therefore the center of the epicycle, remaining at the same distance, would be contrived to move slowly or swiftly on account of the planet's being farther from or nearer to the sun.And although the power driving the planets is faster than any of them, as is shown in Chapter 34, we are here to suppose in our imagination a single ray of power AN  coming from the sun, as if there were a line upon which the center of the epicycle N would always remain.And this line, with that same center N, would be now slow,  now swift, again contrary to what was said above, that the power always produces the same speed at the same distance.Moreover, we would be required to suppose that the  planet has its own rotatory motion away from this imaginary ray AN in the opposite direction, traversing unequal distances in equal times, according as this ray itself  were swifter or slower.In adopting this account, we would indeed approach more closely the geometrical suppositions of the ancients, but we would stray very far from physical theory, as is shown in Ch.2.And my thoughts on the matter have not sufficed to discover a way in which these things can happen naturally.Now all this would be conceived more simply were we to consider the  diameter of the epicycle ND as always remaining parallel to itself.For then the planet would carry out its motion by a mental image, not of the epicycle, but of the center of the eccentric B, and by keeping itself always at the same distance from that center.But at the beginning of this work, in Chapter 2, it was said to be most  absurd that a planet (even if you give it a mind) may imagine for itself a center  and from it a distance, when in that center there is no particular body for the planet to be aware of.Now you might say that the planet observes the sun A, and already knows beforehand, through memory, which ordered distances from the sun a perfect eccentric would have to attain.But first, this is more indirect, and depends upon something intermediate connecting the effect of the perfectly circular path with the indication of the waxing and waning of the sun's diameter, and this too in some mind.But that intermediate can be nothing but the position of the center of the eccentric B at a certain distance from the sun, which, as has just now been said, cannot be known by an unassisted mind.I do not deny that a center can be conceived, and about it a circle.But I do  say this, that if the center is established by thought alone, without respect to time and without any external indication, it is impossible to set up about it, in reality, the perfectly circular path of some movable body.Besides, if the planet were to derive its correct distances from the sun,  ordained by the rule of the circle, from memory, it could also derive from memory the equal arcs of the eccentric which are to be traversed in unequal times, and which are to be traversed by an extrinsic force originating in the sun, as if it were obtaining the values right from the Prutenic or Alphonsine tables.Thus it would know from memory beforehand what this extrinsic and mindless power originating in the sun was going to do.All of these are absurd:âChiefly since, as Aristotle affirms, there is no knowledge of the infinite,  while the infinite is involved in this intension and remission.But it is all right, because even the observations themselves will not allow CD to be a perfect circle, below in Chapter 44, so these theoretical arguments, weak though they are thought to be, do not stand alone, and are that much the less vulnerable to scornful rejection.It is consequently more fitting that the planet itself require no assistance, whether of epicycle or eccentric, but rather that the task which it either performs by itself or has a part in performing is a reciprocating path along the diameter Î³Î¶ directed towards the sun Î±.The question now is, what is the measure by which the planet metes out the correct distances for any given time?Now to us the measure is clear from geometry and the diagram.For whenever the solar power moves the planet forward to the line DA, we then find the angle CBD and make Î³Î²Î´ equal to it; and thus we say that Î±Î´, or Î±Î¹ which is its equal, is the correct distance from A to the planet at D. But this measure which we have proposed for humans, we have just now denied the planet when we removed it from the circumference of the epicycle and restricted it to the straits of the diameter Î³Î¶.Indeed, in this inquiry it is easier to say what is not the case than to say what is.This is because at the moments when the sun has placed the planet on the lines drawn from A through C, D, E, F, G, H, the planet itself is presumed to have produced the distances Î³Î±, Î¹Î±, Î»Î±, Î¶Î±, Î»Î±, Î¹Î±, respectively.Consequently, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, then to equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, correspond unequal descents of the planet along the diameter, namely, Î³Î¹, Î¹Î», Î»Î¶.Moreover, the order is perturbed: the highest is not the smallest, nor the lowest the greatest, but the middle parts Î¹Î» are greatest, and the extremes Î³Î¹  and Î»Î¶ are smaller, and the highest Î³Î¹ are a little smaller than the corresponding lowest, Î»Î¶.For Î³Îº and Î¼Î¶ are equal, and Î³Î¹ is smaller than Î³Îº, while Î»Î¶ is greater than Î¼Î¶.Furthermore, this same cause prevents Î³Î¹, Î¹Î», Î»Î¶, being made proportional to either the times of the equal arcs traversed CD, DE, EF, or to the angles at the sun CAD, DAE, EAF.For the time or duration of the planet on equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, is continuously diminished from the highest to the lowest points, and the angles at the sun are continuously increased, but the reciprocations Î³Î¹ are increased in the middle regions, such as Î¹Î».Therefore, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, the measure of the planet's descent on the diameter Î³Î¶ is neither time, nor distance traversed on the eccentric, nor the angle at the sun.And physical theories, too, also decisively repudiate these measures.What, then, if we should say this: although the motion of the planet does  not take place on an epicycle, this reciprocation is measured out in such a way that distances from the sun are produced that are similar to those which exist in an epicycle actually traversed?First, this attributes to the power belonging to the planet a knowledge of the imaginary epicycle and of its effects in setting out distances from the sun; and further, it attributes knowledge of the future speed or slowness which the common motion from the sun is going to cause.For it is necessary to suppose here an imaginary intension and remission of motion on the imaginary epicycle that is the same as that of the motion on the real eccentric.This is more incredible than the previous accounts, where the motion of the body was combined with knowledge of the epicycle or eccentric.Therefore, the objections raised there should be understood as applying here as well, the judgements being nearly identical.Nevertheless, for want of a better opinion, we must at present put up with  this one.And as for its involving many absurdities, in Chapter 57 below, a certain physicist will quite readily allow this: that on the testimony of the observations the path of the planet is not a circle.So far, the discussion has concerned the measure relating to the form of  this reciprocation.It now remains for us to find the measure of this measure; that is, the measure of the quantity or of motion through place.For it is not enough for the planet to know how far it should be from the sun: it also has to know what to do in order to be at the correct distance.Now anyone who is so attracted to the supposition of a perfectly circular  orbit as to locate in the planet a mind which could preside over the reciprocation, can say only this: that this planetary mind observes the increasing and decreasing size of the solar diameter, and understands, using this as an indication, what distances from the sun it should cause to occur at any given time.For example, sailors cannot know from the sea itself how far they have travelled over the waters, since the course, viewed in that way, has no distinct limits.Instead, they find this either from the amount of time they have sailed, if wind and sea remain constant and the ship does not stop, or from the direction of the wind and the changing elevation of the pole, or from all or several of these in conjunction, or, may it please the gods, by a contrivance of a number of wheels, with paddles lowered into the water (for certain conceited mechanics are proposing an instrument of this sort, who ascribe the calm of the continents to the waves of the Ocean) ^2.In just the same way, the mind  of the planet cannot by itself measure its position, or the distance between itself and the sun, since between them there is pure aethereal air, devoid of any  means of indication.So it makes use either of the increment of time, and an equal exertion of forces through that time (which has just been denied above), or of a physical machine, which is ridiculous (for by the example of the sun and moon we suppose the celestial bodies to be round, and it is therefore also probable that the entire field of the aetheral air moves around with the planets),3 or finally, of some suitable means of indication that are variable with the altered distance of the planet from the sun.And other than the sun's apparent diameter alone, nothing else presents itself.Thus we humans know that the sun is \n",

       " semidiameters when it subtends 31' ^4.If it were indeed certain that this proper motion of the planet along the diameter of the epicycle could not be carried out by any material and corporeal or magnetic power of the planet, nor by an unassisted animate power, but that  it is governed by a planetary mind, nothing absurd would be stated ^5.For that the sun is observed by the planets in other respects as well, the latitudes bear witness.For by these latitudes the planets would depart from the middle and royal road of this solar power, as from the mainstream of a river, and move to the sides, as is said in Chapter 38, unless they meanwhile paid attention to the sun, and carried out their approach and recession along a line drawn to its center.They would then describe circles which, seen from the earth or the center of the world, would appear smaller, parallel to some great circle.But all planets describe great circles that intersect the ecliptic at points that are opposite with respect to the sun, as was demonstrated for Mars from observations  above in Chapters 12, 13, and 14.Therefore, the diameter of reciprocation Î³Î¶ is also directed towards the sun, and the latitudes heed the sun in every respect.However, in Part 5 below I will also transfer this characteristic of the latitude from the elements of mind to the elements of nature and magnetic faculties.Now one cannot say in reply to me that the solar diameter and its variation is far too small to be used as a standard.For it is certain that there is no planet for which it entirely vanishes.Since on earth it is thirty minutes, on Mars it will be twenty, on Jupiter seven, and on Saturn three, while on Venus it will be forty, and on Mercury at least eighty and sometimes as high as one hundred and twenty.Do not grumble about the smallness of the body, but rather the unapt coarseness of human senses, which cannot follow such small things.One should on the contrary note that this body, however nonetheless capable of moving such distant bodies in a circle, as is demonstrated in the preceding chapters.The illumination of the world by such a tiny corpuscle is known to all.And so it is credible that if the movers are endowed with some faculty of observing its diameter, this faculty is as much more acute than our eyes as its work, and the perpetual motion, is more constant than our own troubled and confused schemes.So then, Kepler, would you give each of the planets a pair of eyes?By no  means, nor is this necessary, no more than that they need feet or wings in order  to move.But Brahe has recently eliminated solid orbs.Now our theorizing has not emptied nature's treasure house: we still cannot establish, through our own knowledge, how many senses there ought to be.There are even examples at hand worthy of our admiration.For tell us, in physical terms: with what eyes shall the animate faculties of sublunar bodies look upon the positions of the stars in the zodiac, so that when a harmonic arrangement (which we call \"aspects\") is found among them, the bodies leap up and become inflamed for their task?Was it with her eyes that my noted the positions of the stars in order to know that she was born with Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, all in sextiles and trines?And could it have been by the same means that she gave birth to her children, and especially to me her first born, chiefly on those days when as many as possible of the same aspects, especially of Saturn and Jupiter, recurred, or when as many pristine positions as possible were occupied by squares, oppositions, and conjunctions?I have observed those things in all cases whatever that have occurred to this very day.But why do I say these things that are just as absurd as the previous ones, but for those who have exercised themselves in natural matters more diligently than is usual nowadays?So our hypothetical person who says that the planet's path is a perfect circle will say this: that the planet performs its reciprocation so as to make the diameters of the sun, at the end points of equal arcs of the eccentric, appear very nearly*  inversely proportional to the lines Î´Î±, ÎµÎ±, Î¶Î±, or to Î¹Î±, Î»Î±, Î¶Î±, which are equal to them, taken with respect to the longest line Î³Î±; and that through this consideration of the diameters of the sun at the chosen moments of time, come the proximities of Î¹, Î», Î¶ to Î³.It should be known, however, that the increases of the diameter of the sun and the arcs of the epicycle do not square with each other well, and so the motive mind will have to have a very good memory in order to adjust the unequal versed sines of the arcs on the epicycle to the equal increases of the solar diameter.For this, see Ch.56 and 57 below.Let that be enough concerning the means of indicating distances.There  remains a third point about the animate faculty that carries the planet around that I briefly draw attention to: anyone who says that the body of a planet is moved by an inherent force is just plain wrong.This we rejected at the beginning.But it is also impossible simply to ascribe this force to the sun instead.For the same force that attracts the planet also repels it in turn, and this is inconsistent with the simplicity of the solar body.But anyone who by some unique argument reduces this motion to the bodies of the sun and the planet in concerted action gives a new cast to the material of this entire chapter, and under this rubric Chapter 57 below is specifically assigned for this topic.You see, my thoughtful and intelligent reader, that the opinion of a perfect eccentric circle for the path of a planet drags many incredible things into physical theories.This is not, indeed, because it makes the solar diameter an indicator for the planetary mind, for this opinion will perhaps turn out to be closest to the truth, but because it ascribes incredible faculties to the mover, both mental and animate.But we, who are close to the truth, should find out how to cast these theories (which, though not everywhere perfect, are nonetheless suitable for the sun's motions) in numerical form.In the end, it will be helpful for a more exact discovery of the truth, reserved for Chapter 57, that we had previously worked on them here.CHAPTER 4On the imperfect equivalence between a double epicycle on a concentric, or eccentric-epicycle, and equant on an eccentric.That is how it would be if there were scope for the simple hypothesis of ch.3 to account for the first inequality of the superior planets.However, for demonstrating the first and simple inequality of the planets, Ptolemy makes use of a more elaborate hypothesis.About center B let an eccentric DE be described, with eccentricity BA, so that A is the place of the observer.The line drawn through AB will indicate the apogee at D and the perigee at F. Upon this line, above B, let another segment BC be extended, equal to BA.C will be the point of the equant, that is, the point about which the planet completes equal angles in equal times, even though it lays out the circle around B rather than around C.In Book V ch.4, as well as Book IV ch.71,Copernicus marks this hypothesis among other things in this respect, that it offends against physical principles by instituting irregular celestial motions.For let a point E be chosen on the circle which the planet is bodily traversing, and let it be connected with C, B, and A. Now let DCE be a right angle, as well as ECF.Now since these angles are equal (for they are set up in equal times), and the exterior angle DCE is equal to the interior angles CBE and CEB, therefore, when the part CEB is subtracted, the remainder CBE or DBE will be less than DCE.Consequently, FBE will be greater than DCE or FCE.But the arc DE measures the angle DBE, and the arc EF measures the angle EBF.Therefore, DE is smaller than EF, and the planet passes over them in equal times.Therefore, the same solid orb (Copernicus believed in them)2 in which the planet inheres is slow when the planet borne by the orb proceeds from D to E, and fast when the planet goes from E to F. Therefore, the  entire solid orb is now fast, now slow.This Copernicus rejects as absurd.Now I, too, for good reasons, would reject as absurd the notion that the moving power should preside over a solid orb, everywhere uniform, rather than over the bare planet.But because there are no solid orbs, consider now the physical coherence of this hypothesis when very slight changes are made, as described below.This hypothesis, it should be added, posits two motive powers to move the planet (Ptolemy was unaware of this).It places one of these in the body A (which, in the reformed astronomy will be the very sun itself), and says that this power endeavors to drive the planet around itself, but possesses an infinite number of degrees corresponding to the infinite number of points of the distance from A. Thus, just as AD is the longest, and AF the shortest, so the planet is slowest at D and fastest at F, and in general, as AD is to AE, so is the slowness at D to the slowness at E3, as will be demonstrated at great length in Part III below.The hypothesis attributes another motive power to the planet itself, which has the capacity to adjust its approach to and recession from the sun, either by the strength of the angles or by inspection of the increase or decrease of the solar diameter, and to make the difference between the mean distance and the longest and shortest equal to AB.Therefore, the point of the equant C is nothing but a geometrical short cut for computing the equations from a hypothesis that is clearly physical.But if the planet's path is a perfect circle, as Ptolemy certainly thought, the planet also has to have some additional perception of the swiftness and slowness by which it is carried along by the other external power, in order to adjust its own approach and recession in such accord with the power's precepts that the path DE itself is made to be a circle.It therefore needs both a comprehension of the circle and a desire to effect it.Also, the ratios of its own slowness and swiftness must differ from the gradations of the external power.However, if the demonstrations of astronomy, founded upon observations, should testify that the path of the planet is not quite circular, contrary to what this hypothesis asserts, then this physical account too will be constructed differently and the planet's power will be freed from these rather troublesome requirements.But let me return to Copernicus.In avoiding the absurdity explained just above from his own opinions, he substituted another epicycle for the equant, in the following way.About center Î± with radius Î±Î² equal to BD let the concentric Î²Î´ be described, so that the observer is at Î±; let Î±Î², parallel to BD, be extended in both directions; and let the angle Î²Î±Î´ be set up equal to DCE.Now let BC be bisected at I, and about the centers Î² and Î´ with radii Î²Î³ and Î´Î¶ equal to AI let the first or greater epicycle be described, and let Î´Î¶ be parallel to Î±Î².Next, about centers Î³ and Î¶, but with radii Î³Îµ, Î¶Î· equal to IC, let the second epicycle be described, and let its motion be eastward, with twice the speed of the motion of the first.And let the westward motion of the first epicycle be equal to the motion of the eccentric.And since Î³ is on Î±Î², let the planet be at Îµ, the point nearest Î². And since Î²Î±Î´ is  right, let the planet be at Î·, the point farthest from the center of the greater epicycle Î´. This particular hypothesis of Copernicus is also followed by Tycho Brahe religiously, in all particulars.Physically considered, this hypothesis is in any event valid if you grant solid orbs.However, if you remove these, as Brahe does with good reason, it says something practically impossible.For it attaches three movement- producing minds to a single planet; and besides, the other two [minds] will be thrown into confusion by the motion and impulse of one of them towards the body at Î±. For that any of them should pay heed to its own center, which is not distinguished by any body and is mobile besides, cannot be represented even in thought.Further, while Copernicus strives to outdo Ptolemy in the uniformity of motions, he is in turn outdone by him in the perfection of the planetary path.For, in Ptolemy, the planet bodily traces out a perfect circle in the aethereal air.Copernicus, on the other hand, says in Book V ch.4 that for him the path of a planet is not circular, but goes outside the circular path at the sides.This is easily demonstrated in the present diagram.If from Îµ, the planet's position at apogee, you extend the distance Î±Î², the semidiameter of the orb, to Î¸, and from Î¸ draw Î¸Îº parallel to Î±Î´, the circle ÎµÎº described about Î¸ will indeed go through Îµ and the perigeal point opposite, but since it touches the straight line Î´Î· only at k, while the planet goes through Î·, it does not stay on the circle ÎµÎº, but strays outside this track.To this excursion of the planetary path from the perfection of the circle Ptolemy might well have objected against Copernicus, but I do not.For below, in Part IV, it will be demonstrated that by the agency of two physical powers, simple in capability, acting in concert to move the planet, it necessarily happens that the planet turns aside from the circle for a short time, though not by running outside of it, as in this Copernican hypothesis, but in the opposite direction, towards the center; that is, by making an incursion.Besides, should Copernicus retain that liberty he had of setting up the ratios of the epicycles, it can happen that the planet's path would come out twisted, higher before and after apogee than at apogee itself, and lower before and after perigee than at perigee itself.This happened to Tycho in his lunar theory, inasmuch as he followed Copernicus.That these two forms of hypothesis are not simply equivalent, I shall demonstrate numerically.In the Ptolemaic form it can be computed more simply than Ptolemy did in the following manner.First, in triangle CBE, given the mean anomaly ECB or DCE, the side CB â the eccentricity of the equantâis also given, as well as the radius of the orb, BE.Therefore, as the radius of the orb is to the sine of ECB, so is CB to the sine of CEB.And since ECD is equal to the two opposite interior angles CEB and CBE taken together, therefore CEB subtracted from DCE leaves CBE.Therefore, in  triangle EBA, the angle at B is given, together with the sides about it.For BA is the eccentricity of the eccentric, while EB is the radius of the orb.Therefore, following the rule for this form of triangle, the angle BEA is given.But CEB was given before.Therefore, the whole equation CEA will be given.We shall now make use of numbers belonging to the motion of Mars.Although Ptolemy made CB and BA equal, Copernicus, freed from this rule, nonetheless also adopted other ratios, which Tycho Brahe undertook to imitate.Let CB be \n",

although it is in fact 365 days and 6 hours, I set it equal to 360 degrees, or a full circle, which for the astronomers is the mean anomaly.As a result, I have so arranged it that as the sum of  the distances is to the sum of the time, so is any given distance to its time.Finally, I added the times over the individual degrees and compared these times, or degrees of mean anomaly,  with the degrees of the eccentric anomaly, or the number of parts whose distance was sought.This furnished the physical equation, to which the optical equation, found by the method of Chapter 29 with those same distances, was to be added in order to have the whole.However, since this procedure is mechanical and tedious, and since it is impossible to compute the equation given the ratio for one individual degree without the others, I looked around for other means.And since I knew that the points of the eccentric are infinite, and their distances are infinite, it struck me that all these distances are contained in the plane of the eccentric.For I had remembered that Archimedes, in seeking the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, once thus divided a circle into an infinity of triangles - this being the hidden force of his reductio ad absurdum.Accordingly, instead of dividing the circumference, as before, I now cut the plane of the eccentric into 360 parts by lines drawn from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned.Let AB be the line of apsides, A the sun (or earth, for Ptolemy); B the center of the eccentric CD, whose semicircle CD shall be divided into any number of equal parts CG, GH, HE, EI, IK, KD, and let the points A and B be connected with the points of division.Therefore, AC will be the greatest distance, AD the least, and the others, in order, are AG, AH, AE, AI, AK.And since triangles under equal altitudes are as their bases, and the sectors, or triangles, CBG, GBH, and so on (standing upon least parts of the circumference and therefore not differing from straight lines) all have the same altitude, the equal sides BC, BG, BH, they are therefore all equal.But all the triangles are contained in the area CDE, and all the arcs or bases are contained in the circumference CED.Therefore, by composition, as the area CDE is to the arc CED so is the area CBG to the arc CG, and alternately, as arc CED is to CG, CH, and the rest in order, so is the area CDE to the areas CBG, CBH, and the rest in order.Therefore, no error is introduced if the areas be taken for the arcs in this way, and substituting the areas CGB, CHB for the angles of eccentric anomaly CBG, CBH.Further, just as the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the circumference are all contained in the area of the semicircle CDE, and the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the arc CH are all contained in the area CBH, therefore also the straight lines from A to the same infinite parts of the circumference or arc make up the same thing.And finally, since those drawn from A and B both fill up one and the same semicircle CDE, while those from Aare the very distances whose sum is sought, it therefore seemed to me I could conclude that by computing the area CAH or CAE I would have the sum of the infinite distances in CH or CE, not because the infinite can be traversed, but because I thought that the measure of the faculty by which the collected distances mete out the times is contained in this area, so that we would be able to obtain it by knowing the area without an enumeration of least parts.Therefore, from the above, as the area CDE is to half the periodic time, which we have proclaimed to be 180Â°, so are the areas CAG, CAH to the times on CG and CH.Thus the area CGA becomes a measure of the time or mean anomaly corresponding to the arc of the eccentric CG, since the mean anomaly measures the time ^1.Earlier, however, the part CGB of this area CAG was the measure of the eccentric anomaly, whose optical equation is the angle BGA.Therefore, the remaining area, that of the triangle BGA, is the excess (for this place) of the mean anomaly over the eccentric anomaly, and the angle BGA of that triangle is the excess of the eccentric anomaly CBG over the equated anomaly CAG.Thus the knowledge of this one triangle provides both parts of the equation corresponding to the equated anomaly GAC.And hence it is manifest why in Chapters 30 and 31 above I said that in  the theory of the sun the parts of the equation are very nearly equal.That is, any given arc, and the angle at the center which it subtends (as CG and CBG in the figure), are measured by its area, which is called the \"sector\", as area CBG.Therefore, with one arm of the compass at G, with radius GB, let an arc of the circumference be described intersecting GA at O. Hence, as the area GBC is to the angle GBC, so is the area BGO to the angle BGO.But the angle BGO is the optical part of the equation.Thus the area GOB, through the doubling of the part of the equation, measures the optical part of the equation, for in our account presented earlier the whole area GBA was to be consulted for the physical part of the equation.Now clearly the genuine measure of the physical part of the equation AGB exceeds the proposed measure of the optical part OGB by the small space or area OAB (while near the perigee the latter in turn exceeds the former by a small area).Nevertheless, if the eccentricity is small, as is that of the sun or earth, with which we are concerned in this third part, this is not perceptible.For the nearer it approaches to the line of apsides, the narrower becomes the whole triangle AGB and consequently also its little part AOB, however much its altitude AO increases at the same time.On the other hand, in the middle elongations, the angle BEA with its sector is at a certain point directly measured by the area BEA, and the excess begins to turn into a defect.Therefore, the greatest difference that can occur is that accumulated at the octants, or locations intermediate between the apsides and the quadrants.How great that difference is, will now be shown.Since for some time now I have used the same form of computation by means of areas in the theory of Mars, I could not ignore this difference on account of the planet's great eccentricity, nor did the doubling of the optical equation avoid all perceptible error.It was therefore necessary to investigate the area of the triangle of the equation [triangulum aequatorium].This can be done in various ways, but I shall go on to state the easiest.It is well known that triangles with equal altitudes are proportional to</br>their bases.I say also, that triangles on equal bases are proportional to</br>their altitudes.Let AGB, AHB stand upon the same base AB extended to C. From G let the line GN be drawn parallel to the common base AB and intersecting HB at N, and let N be connected with A. From the three vertices G, Î, N, of the triangles let GM, HL, MP be drawn perpendicular to the base, determining the altitudes of the triangles.Therefore, since GN and MP are parallel, and GM, NP are perpendicular [to them], GM and NP will be equal.But GM is the altitude of triangle AGB, and NP is the altitude of triangle ANB.Therefore triangles ANB and AGB have equal altitudes, and since they are both on the same base AB, they are equal.And since ANB is part of AHB, and the base line HB is common, together with the vertex A, the triangles NAB and HAB have equal altitudes.Therefore, as the base NB is to BH, so is NAB to HAB.But NAB and GAB were proved equal.Therefore, as NB is to BH, so is GAB to HAB.But as BN is to BH, so is NP to HL, because NBP and HBL are similar triangles.Therefore also, as NP is to HL, so is GAB to HAB.But NP and GM are equal.Therefore, as GM is to HL, altitude to altitude, so is area GAB to area HAB.q.e.d.Now let BE be perpendicular to CD, and let the triangle BEA have a right angle at B. BE will be the altitude, and BA the base.Therefore, by Euclid I.42, \n",

But one cannot proceed in the same way with triangles standing upon the circumference with their vertices at A, because the circumference is intersected obliquely by the straight lines from A in all places other than C and D.You could have found this error empirically, as I myself did, by taking all the distances AC, AG, AH, at the individual whole degrees of the angle CBG, GBH, and adding them all up.(These distances, though they are presented in the table in Chapter 30, correspond in position to individual whole degrees of the angle at A, and consequently to angles at B cut minutewise.Nevertheless,  one could easily find, by interpolation, the distance from A corresponding to any angle of an integral number of degrees about B.)Now the sum comes out to be greater than \n",

       " although 360 of the distances from B add up to exactly 36,000,000.But, on the contrary, if both sums were measured by the same area of the circle, the sums ought to have been equal.A demonstration of the error, on the other hand, is as follows.Through B let any straight line other than CD be drawn, intersecting the circumference, and let it be EF; and let the points of intersection E and F be connected with A. Now since the point A does not lie on the line EF, EAF is a figure, a triangle.Therefore, EA, AF together are longer than EF, by Euclid I.22.But the area of the circle contains the sum of all lines EF, and therefore it contains a sum which is less than all the lines EA, AF, since any two opposite points on the eccentric, together with A, determine such a triangle, with the exception of C, D, A, where instead of a triangle there is a straight line.I would add, in passing, that it is also proved, in the same way, that the distances from A corresponding to all of the 360 integral degrees of the angle at A (which are in the table in Chapter 30 above), added up in one sum, are less than 36,000,000.For through the point A let any straight line other than CD be drawn (let it be EV), and let E and V be connected with B. In the triangle EBV, the straight lines EB, BV together will be longer than EA, AV, two opposite distances.But all 360 of EB, BV taken together are 36,000,000.Therefore, all 360 of EA, AV taken together are less than \n",

       " is not true.Second, it uses a plane which does not exactly measure the distances of all points from the sun.Nevertheless,  as if by a miracle, each of these exactly cancels the effect of the other, as is demonstrated below in Chapter 59 ^3.And because at the present time there are first-rate geometers who on occasion labor endlessly on matters whose usefulness is not so evident, I call upon one and all to help me here to find some plane figure equal to the sum of the distances.I have indeed myself found it geometrically - in a broad sense - but let them show me how to express numerically what I have delineated geometrically; that is, let them show how to square the figure I have found.Let the circumference CED be unfolded into a straight line and divided into as many parts as before at the points G, Î, E, I, K, and let perpendiculars be set up at the points of division equal to the radius CB, and let the parallelogram be completed.This will be double the Archimedean triangle, by which he measured the area of the semicircle.Now if you were to make individual parallelograms in this manner in the individual sectors, then the whole parallelogram divided into parts will be equivalent to the whole area of the semicircle; that is, the ratio 2:1 holds everywhere.Now, in the same manner, let the distances CA, GA, and so on, be set up, and the points A be connected by the conchoid*  A, A, A, A, drawn through the individual points (which are potentially infinite): the figure AACD will be equivalent to all the distances from A. For similarly the individual lines AG, AH have approximately made up the one parallelogram, except that the conchoid is not parallel to CD, but inclined to the radii GA, HA, EA, exactly as the distances are inclined to the circumference in the circle itself.Hence, there is nothing wrong with the conchoid's being made longer than the semicircle CD.But EA is longer than EB, so that, if CA, GQ, HR, EB, IS, KL, DA, be taken, equal to lines determined by perpendiculars drawn from A to the lines between the points and B (as, in the circular diagram, the perpendicular AR is dropped to HB extended, defining HR which is shorter than HA), the figure between the conchoid AQRBSLA and CD would be quite equal to the figure CBBD.For the conchoid would intersect BB at the line EA, and because BA at the top and bottom are equal, and BQ is equal to LB, BR to SB, and so on, the figures BBRQA and BBALS would therefore be congruent.One of these is added to, and the other subtracted from, the equal figures CBBE and EBBD, and therefore, the whole figure between AQRBSLA and CD is equal to that between BB and CD.Hence, the small area between the two conchoids AQRBSLA and AAAAAA is the measure of the excesses of the distances from A over the distances from B âand the standard of measure is the same as that by which the parallelogram is set equal to all the distances from B.It should also be noted that this area is not of the same breadth at places equally removed from the line EA, but wider below.For in the circular diagram let HBR be extended to V, so that AH, AV correspond respectively to the upper angle HBE and the lower angle FBV, which are equal and are equally removed from the middle points E and F. And about center A with radius AV let the arc XY be drawn through AH and BH.Now if you connect A and Y, 4 AYR will be exactly congruent to the triangle AVR, for AV and AY and AX are equal, by construction,  and are the longer sides, while VR, RY are equal and are the shorter.But from the point H outside the circumference XY two lines are drawn: HX through the center A, and HY not through the center.Therefore, HY is longer than HX, and therefore the greater AV or AX is increased by the shorter XH, and the lesser VR or RY is increased by the longer YHâand nevertheless, the whole RH remains shorter than the whole AH.Therefore, the difference between RH and AH is less than the difference between RY and AX, that is, between VR and VA.And consequently in the conchoid SA is greater, and RA less, although IE, EH are equal.Therefore, the area between the two conchoids is not bisected by EA.However, it appears to be bisected by BB, which some geometer should investigate, who should at the same time show how to square the area between the conchoids, so that it may be expressible in numbers.In Chapter 43 below you will find a rough estimate of this area.Granted, these general considerations of the computation of the physical equation are not yet well enough supported by the geometrical apparatus.Nevertheless, I wished to given them a preliminary treatment here, so that when all the planetary inequalities are determined (as, in particular, we presupposed that the course of the sun or earth is a perfect eccentric, which will be denied concerning Mars below in Ch.44 and 53), this operation will not be so sharply divorced from its basis in physical theory.For, touching the theory of the sun, with which we have been concerned to this point, we introduce no discrepancy either by misjudging the area of the conchoid, which we have taken to be less than it really is, or the assumption of a perfect eccentric, in which we appear to be erring in excessâto what extent cannot yet be said, since all has not been presented.But the very things which have been rejected in this chapter as paralogisms will be taken up again below, when we shall have come to a perfectly correct way of expressing the equations, when the thing that gave rise to the paralogism will have been eliminated from that hypothesis.I have described within a hair's breadth, through most certain observations and proofs, the cause and measure of the second inequality, which makes the planets appear stationary, direct, and retrograde.It has been shown that this second inequality itself shares something in common with the first inequality, and that the theory of the sun or earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle (for Ptolemy) is like the theory of the other planets.Also, the physical causes of this inequality have been found, and have been adapted to the calculation in the theory of the sun.Therefore, it is fitting that I now bring to a close this third part, as a morning task followed by lunch, with the master of the Metamorphoses adding his voice to mine:Part remains of what has been begun, part of the work is finished:The anchor is cast; here let the craft lie.5Chapter 41A trial examination of the apsides and eccentricity, and of the ratio of the orbs, using the observations recently employed, made at locations other than opposition with the sun, with, however, a false assumption.In the second part, above, I tried to find the aphelion and eccentricity, as well as the distances of the star Mars from the sun on the entire circle, using acronychal observations in imitation of the ancients.And indeed, the eccentric equations corresponded closely to other observations made elsewhere than at opposition with the sun.However, the eccentricity and the distances from the sun were first repudiated by the annual parallaxes of longitude and latitude.Therefore, in order that the distances of the star from the center of the sun could be found throughout the circumference of the eccentric, the second inequality (epicyclic, for Ptolemy, or belonging to the annual orb for Tycho and Copernicus) had to be explored first, in Part 3.But now, if the planet's path were a perfect circle, the planet's first inequality, which exists by reason of the eccentric, could be investigated immediately.For in Chapter 25 above we presented a method by which, given the distances of three points of the circumference from some point within the circumference, and the angles at that point, to find the position and size of the circle with respect to that point, the center and eccentricity, along with the apsides.Now, in Chapter 26, the distance of Mars from the center of the sun was found to be \n",

       ", since it is certain that an error of this magnitude cannot be attributed to our vicarious hypothesis, I had to accept that this procedure for finding the  equations was still imperfect.Indeed, in Chapter 19 as well, when I tried out the bisection on Mars and computed the equations using a motionless point of the equant in the Ptolemaic manner, a difference was found at about 45Â° of eccentric anomaly of nearly the same amount, but in the opposite direction.For in the upper quadrant, the planet was closer to the aphelion, and in the lower to the perihelion, than it should have been; while here in the upper quadrant it was farther from the aphelion, and in the lower from the perihelion, than it should be.And so in the upper quadrant it is moving too swiftly away from the aphelion, and the same from the perihelion below.Therefore, it is slower than it should be in the middle elongations.I believe it has just occurred to the reader that the cause of these errors might  perhaps lie in the flaw to which this operation with areas is subject, mentioned in Chapter 40: that the areas are not equivalent to the distances that modify the swiftness and slowness.But the present error cannot arise thence.For first of all, the excess of the sum of the distances over the area of the circle is small: just about as small, that is, as the little space between the conchoids.Then, too, the area makes all the distances a little smaller than they should be, and most of all those that are at the middle elongations.So if any error flows from this, it lies in our not having made the planet take enough time in the middle elongations.But the errors we are now seeing are in the opposite direction, for we have made the planet take too much time in the middle elongations.The same can be raised in objection to anyone who might conceive a suspicion that the error arose because we rejected the double epicycle of Copernicus and Tycho, which makes the orbit of the planet oval, and took up the Ptolemaic perfect circle in the present account.For it was said at the end of Chapter 4 that the Copernican orbit moves outwards from the center by 246 parts, which would only increase the error, rather than making an incursion towards the center, as would suit our purposes, since we are now following the idea that the time increments are proportional to the distances.But to make it clear to the eye that the area of  the conchoid of Ch.40 is made very small, consider that the secant of the angle 5Â° 19' (the maximum optical equation) is \n",

attention to the force of the demonstrations used hitherto, and will be shamelessly imputing to me the vilest fraud in corrupting the observations of Brahe.I therefore appeal to the observations of subsequent years, at least those that experienced observers made.For if in any respect I have given free rein to my inclinations in one direction, it will only go so much the farther into error on the other side.But there is no need of this.I am addressing this to you who are experienced in matters astronomical, who know that in astronomy there is no tolerance for the sophistical loopholes that beset other disciplines.To you I appeal.You see at Îº a small defect from the circle, at Î·, Î¸ on both sides, a rather large one, enough so that we cannot excuse it by uncertainties in observing (for in Chapter 42 I reckon an uncertainty of perhaps 200, or at most 300 units).What, then, is to be said?Could this actually be the situation described in Chapter 6 above, in which by transposition of the reference point from the sun's mean motion to its apparent motion I set up another eccentric that makes an excursion towards the side of the sun's apogee?By no means.For there, it would approach from the one side by the same amount as it moves away on the other.Here, however, you see that the planet approaches the center from the circular orbit on both sides.This is confirmed by many other observations, some of which follow below in Chapters 51 and 53.Clearly, then, [what is to be said] is this: the orbit of the planet is not a circle, but comes in gradually on both sides and returns again to the circle's distance at perigee.They are accustomed to call the shape of this sort of path  \"oval.\"This same thing is also proved from Chapter 43 preceding.There it was  supposed that the area of a perfect eccentric is very closely equivalent to all the distances of the equal parts of the circumference of that eccentric from the source of the motive power, however many they are.Thus, the parts of the area measure the amounts of time which the planet spends on the parts of the corresponding eccentric circumference.But if that area about which the planet marks a boundary is not a perfect circle, but is diminished at the sides from the amplitude it has at the apsides, and if nevertheless this area circumscribed by an irregular orbit still measures the times which the planet takes to traverse the whole and its equal parts, then this diminished area measures a time equal to that measured by the previous undiminished area.So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there.So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened.Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4.And indeed, if contraries remedy one another, this is plainly the aptest medicine for purging the faults under which, in Chapter 43 above, our physical hypothesis was perceived to be laboring.For the planet is going to be swifter at the middle elongations, where previously it was perceived to be going slower than it should, and it will be slowed down above and below, near the apsides, where previously it did violence to the equations belonging to the eighths of the period through its excessive fleetness.This, then, is the other argument by which it is proved that the orbit of the planet really is deflected from the established circle, making ingress towards the sides and the centre of the eccentric.But for all that, this argument still did not have enough effect upon me to let me go beyond it and think about the planet's departure from the orbit.When I had sweated for the longest time trying to reconcile equations of this sort, I was finally discouraged by the absurdity of the measurements, and abandoned the whole enquiry until I was informed by the distances (found in the way shown in Chapter 41) about the departure from the [circular] orbit, and once more took up this problem of the equations.And from this, what I promised I would prove, in Chapters 20 and 23 above, is now done: that the orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape.Chapter 45On the natural causes of this deflection of the planet from the circle: first opinion examined.When I was first informed in this manner by Brahe's most certain  observations that the orbit of the planet is not exactly circular but is deficient at the sides, I judged that I also knew the natural cause of the deflection from its footprints.For I had worked very hard on that subject in Chapter 39.And I suggest to the reader that he reread that entire chapter carefully before going on.For in that chapter I assigned the cause of the eccentricity to a certain power that is in the body of the planet.It therefore followed that the cause of this deflecting from the eccentric circle should also be ascribed to the same body of the planet.But then what they say in the proverb, \"A hasty dog bears blind pups,\" happened to me.For in Chapter 39,1 worked very energetically on the question of why I could not state a probable enough cause for a perfect circle's resulting from the orbit of the planet, as some absurdities always had to be attributed to the power that has its seat in the planet's body.Now, having seen from the observations that the planet's orbit is not perfectly circular, I immediately succumbed to this great persuasive impetus, believing that from those things which were called absurd in fabricating the circle in Chapter 39, now transmuted into a more probable form, an orbit of the planet that would be both correct and in agreement with the observations would be effected.If I had embarked upon this path a little more thoughtfully, I might have immediately arrived at the truth of the matter.But since I was blind from desire, and did not pay attention to each and every part of Chapter 39, staying instead with the first thought to offer itselfâa wonderfully probable one, owing to the uniformity of the epicyclic motionâI entered into new labyrinths, from which we will have to extract ourselves in this Chapter 45 and the following ones all the way to 50.Let the diagram from Chapter 39 be repeated.The weaker opinion in that chapter was that, in order to describe a perfect circle, the planet effects an epicycle by its inherent force, thus disengaging its body from the ray of power from the sun.As, for example, if the ray of power from the sun be AC, and move forward at an unequal pace from AC to AÎ³, while the planet be initially at C, and from that time forth, by its inherent force, it disengage itself from [the ray] AC or AÎ³.Thus, at the time when AC comes to AÎ³, the planet from C or Î³ would come to D, and would also do this at a nonuniform pace, more swiftly or slowly in the same proportion as [the length of] AC.For in this fashion the line ND through the center  of the epicycle and the planet remains ever parallel to the line AB.However, I said in Chapter 39 that it appeared absurd to me that the planet [in moving] from Î³ to D at a nonuniform pace disengages itself from the ray of the solar power, and thus accommodates itself by its own force to the extrinsic force from the sun, and has foreknowledge of its speed and the decrease thereof.Therefore, to avoid this absurdity, let AC still go nonuniformly, but let the planet go uniformly from Î³ to D. Let us see whether what follows is anything like what we have proved in the preceding chapter from the observations.While the center of the epicycle N and its aphelion [in moving] from the line AC to AÎ³ will be slow from C to Î³, it being near the eccentric's aphelion C, let the planet [in moving] from Î³ to D be supposed not to be slow but to proceed with its mean motion.Consequently, the angle Î³ND will be greater than the angle Î³AC.So ND will not be parallel to AB but will be inclined towards AC.Thus the planet D will not stay on the circle which it began to describe from C, the one, that is, which goes through CF, but will encroach from the circumference D and the parallel ND towards CA.And this same thing was also affirmed in the previous chapter by the distances AD computed from the observations, namely, that they do not reach all the way to the circumference of the circle CF.This same thing was also affirmed by the physical equations constructed through the summation of the distances AC, AD, namely, that the planet ought to be faster at the sides of the eccentric; that is, that its distances from the sun ought to be supposed smaller.Therefore, since this consensus brought to bear a considerable force of persuasion, I concluded forthwith that the planet's incursion at the sides is the result of this: that the power moving the planet and administering the distances according to the law of the circle supersedes the power of the sun, in that the former made equal progress in equal times thus sending the planet down uniformly towards the sun according to the law of the epicycle, while the latter, in its varying degrees [of speed obtained] through the varying distances, moved the planet in its care forward nonuniformly, and more slowly when it is high.It thus happened that the distances of equal arcs on the epicycle were accumulated near the aphelion C and the perihelion F, and were more sparsely scattered about the middle elongations.In this way, all the shorter ones were drawn back upwards from the correct [circular] distances from perihelion to the place of longer ones.That error therefore began to become rooted in me which I had happily begun to refute in Chapter 39 above, that it is a property of the planetary power to lead the body of the planet around in the path of an epicycle.Had the diameter of the epicycle ND remained equidistant from AB, I could have shed my erroneous opinion, and could have ascribed (as is perfectly correct) all promotion in zodiacal longitude to the sun, leaving to the planet only the reciprocation on the diameter Î³Î¶, as in part of Chapter 39.But because the observations testified that the diameter of the epicycle is inclined in the middle elongations, this error concerning the motion of the planet on the circumference of the epicycle, whose motion would be regular measured with respect to the line ÎÎÎ³ going from the sun A through the center of  the epicycle N, was admirably confirmed in me.Think yourself, reader, and you will feel the force of the argument.For I did not think it possible for the planet's orbit to be rendered oval in any other way.When, therefore, these things occurred to me, quite certain of the quantity of the incursion at the sides (that is, that the numbers would be in agreement), I celebrated another triumph over Mars.Nor did it appear to me any difficulty, if there were some discord among the numbers, to dissipate it through some slight adjustment in the equations of the center1 all around, so as to make it imperceptible.And we, good reader, can fairly indulge in so splendid a triumph for a brief day's respite (for the following five chapters, that is), meanwhile repressing the rumors of renewed rebellion, lest its splendor die before we enjoy it.If anything will be left of it afterwards, we shall go through it in the proper time and order.We are merry indeed now, but [will be] active and energetic then.Chapter 46How the line of the planetâs motion can be described from the opinion of Chapter 45, and what its properties are.In the preceding chapter a cause was stated by which it could happen that the planet depart from a circular orbit.However, the geometrical description of the path cannot be carried out using this model.For the epicycle is inclined according to the length of the distances, while the multitude and length of the distances is in turn dependent upon the rotation of the epicycle.And because the sum of the distances is contained in the plane of the eccentric, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, that sum cannot be found unless the epicycle be transformed into an eccentric.But it was demonstrated in Chapter 2, and repeated in Chapter 39, and used in Chapter 40, that if a concentric be described about center Î± with semidiameter equal to Î²Î´, and on it an epicycle with semidiameter Î±Î²; and then about center Î² an eccentric Î´Î» with eccentricity Î±Î²; and afterwards the circumferences of both the epicycle and the eccentric Î´Î» be divided into similar parts; the distances of the points of division, both of the epicycle and the eccentric, from the chosen point Î± are respectively equal to one another in length.On this premise, since in Chapter 40 we posited an eccentric to present a plain and easy demonstration, and a method of computing the distances, here, too, we can examine the distances on the eccentric, even though we are supposing them to be meted out by the uniform motion of the planetâs epicycle.This procedure seems to open a way to us to a geometrical description of the planetary path that follows from the hypothesis of Chapter 45.Let us therefore say, for the sake  of understanding, that in the circuit of the epicycle the planet makes digressions from the sun Î± of the same magnitude as if it were on the circumference of a perfect eccentric Î´Î» (and let this be a semicircle defined by the straight line Î»Î±Î²Î´) describing equal arcs in equal times, such as Î´Îµ, ÎµÎ¶, Î¶Î¸, Î¸Î¹, Î¹Îº, ÎºÎ».It does this in such a manner that the angles at Î² are equal, and Î² is the point of uniform motion, at least for this position for which the distances are being sought.Let the points of division be connected to Î± and Î². Now this semicircle is purely fictitious: it should be drawn only for computing the sum of a number of distances.If the planet were moved forward with the same degree of power from the sun at both Î´ and Î», in the same manner as the epicyclical rotation is supposed to be always uniformly set in motion, then it really would traverse these equal parts of the eccentric, from which we have taken the distances, in equal times; and also, the distances corresponding to the times denoted by the points of division would be these very ones, Î±Î´, Î±Îµ, Î±Î¶, Î±Î¸, Î±Î¹, Î±Îº, Î±Î», not only in quantity, but also in their identical position.In a word, the path of the planet would be the circle Î´Î¸Î».The planet does in fact represent quantitatively the reported distances resulting from the uniform rotation of the epicycle, but is itself moved forward unequally in equal times by the sun, less at Î´, more at Î». Thus in the time signified and measured by Î´Î²Îµ*,  it does not traverse the space Î´Îµ, although it does attain the distance Î±Îµ.And in [that same] time (measured by the angle Î»Î²Îº, equal to ÎµÎ²Î´) it traverses more space than ÎºÎ», although it attains the length of the distance Î±Îº ^1.Therefore, the planet has a length of distance Î±Îµ before it is actually moved forward to Îµ, and a length of distance Î±Îº before it is moved forward to Îº; and inversely, when it is moved forward to Îµ or Îº, it has already been at the distances Î±Îµ and Î±Îº, and for that reason it will now be somewhat nearer.Thus the planet, when at Îµ, Îº, and all the other points of this sort, is nearer to the point Î± than are the points Îµ, Îº on the circumference.So the planet moves inward from the established distance of the circle Î´Î» towards the point Î± which is near the center Î², never coinciding with this circle at any points other than Î´, Î». For the manner of the incursion is the same in the opposite semicircle.Also, the plane Î´Î±Îµ, Î´Î±Î¶, and so on, contains in itself the sum of the distances of all the points on the arc of the epicycle, which, by Chapter 40, is similar to the arc Î´Îµ.And yet the planet, in equal times (which are now being measured by Î´Îµ, ÎµÎ¶), describes unequal arcs on its real path, short when it is far from the sun Î±, long when it moves near to the sun, in such a way that the arcs of the planetary path which are traversed in equal times are in the inverse ratio of the distances, by Ch.32.It thus happens that the arc ÎµÎ´ (which is here the measure of the time) exceeds the arc of the path traversed, which let be Î¼Î´, to about the same extent that the area ÎµÎ±Î´ exceeds the sector ÎµÎ²Î´, whose measure is the angle ÎµÎ²Î´ or the arc ÎµÎ´.If you declare the entire plane area to be 360Â° in number, just as the circumference  of the circle, and the periodic time as well, then the number of the time, or Î´Îµ (at this position) is approximately the mean, either arithmetic or geometric (for they hardly differ) between the number of the sum of the distances or the area ÎµÎ±Î´, and the number  of the planetary path or Î¼Î´.There occurs here a multiple obstacle to calculation ^2.First, that the plane of the circle is not perfectly equivalent to the sum of the distances, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, even though it was said at the end of Chapter 43 that the defect is quite small.Second, that the proportion just described is not exactly geometrical.True, the individual distances are to the individual mean distances in the inverse ratio of the individual arcs of the planetary path to the mean arcs.But the sum of a certain number of distances does not maintain the same ratio to the sum of the same number of mean distances, as the sum of the same number of arcs to the sum of the mean arcs, inversely.As you will see from an example.Let the two distances be 12 and 11, the mean 10, and let the mean arc be the same.And let it be that, as the distance 12 is to the mean distance 10, so is the mean arc 10 to the arc 8â belonging to the distance 12.Let it also be that as the distance 11 is to 10, so is the arc 10 to \n",

       " sum of the two means is 20, the sum of the two arcs is 17$\\frac{14}{33}$.Here, 10 was indeed the mean proportional between 12 and 8â, and between 11 and 9$\\frac{1}{11}$, but now the sum 20 is not the mean proportional between 23 and 17$\\frac{14}{33}$, but between 23 and 17$\\frac{19}{23}$, which is greater ^3.However, this ratio is valid for the arithmetic mean.For example, let 10 be the arithmetic mean between 12 and 8; likewise, between 11 and 9.Compound 12 and 11: they make 23.Compound 8 and 9: they make 17.Therefore, 20 is again the arithmetic mean between 17 and 23.And since it was demonstrated in Chapter 32 that there is hardly any difference for the present undertaking between the arithmetic and geometric means, what is here denied to be true for all cases will therefore be only slightly different from the truth.Third, even if the area ÎµÎ²Î´ were the exact geometric mean between ÎµÎ±Î´ and Î¼Î²Î´, nonetheless, it cannot be constructed geometrically.For the triangle Î±ÎµÎ² ought to be equal to the sector ÎµÎ²Î¼.But geometers have yet to devise a method by which a given angle can be cut in a given ratio.Fourth, if none of the above deter us, the sector Î¼Î²Î´ of the circle is still not the same as the so-called \"sector\" Î¼Î²Î´ of the oval plane.Therefore, even if the arc Î¼Î´  were defined as if it were on the circumference of a circle, nevertheless, nothing would follow concerning Î¼Î´ defined as if it were an arc on the path of the planet, which is not a circle.Therefore, even though this is helpful to those who would like to make use of numbers, to know that ÎµÎ²Î´ is a mean between ÎµÎ±Î´ and Î¼Î²Î´; nevertheless, for us, who strive after a geometrical path, this passage does not lie open.We shall therefore try another way.And on our fictitious eccentric Î´Î¸Î» the measure of the time is Î´Îµ, Î´Î¶ for finding out the distances Î±Îµ, Î±Î¶, while the ratio of the sectors Î´Î²Îµ, Î´Î²Î¶ to one another is the same as that of the arcs Î´Îµ, Î´Î¶.However, on the true path of the planet, the plane [area] lying between the arc of the path and the sun Î± is likewise the true measure of the time during which the planet is found on the arc lying above it, by Chapter 40.Therefore, from the point Î± of the diameter  let straight lines be projected enclosing spaces equal to ÎµÎ²Î´, Î¶Î²Î´, so that the space ÎµÎ·Î¼, which is subtracted from the space ÎµÎ²Î´, is equal to the space Î·Î±Î², which is added to that same space ÎµÎ²Î´.And let these lines be Î±Î¼, Î±Î½.And about center Î±, with radii Î±Îµ, Î±Î¶, let arcs ÎµÎ¼, Î¶Î½ be drawn intersecting these lines at Î¼, Î½. Will the points Î¼, Î½, o, Ï, and so on, constructed in this way, be thus obtained correctly, so that in the times Î´Îµ, Î´Î¶, Î´Î¸, Î´Î¹, Î´Îº the planet will arrive at them?This is indeed approximately true, but here, too, three things are wanting.First, as above, the plane is not exactly equivalent to the sum of the distances.Second, there is no geometrical way showing how to cut a given semicircle in a given ratio with a straight line  drawn from a given point on the diameter.Third, it is not known whether the shortfall for any of the planes Î¼Î±Î´, Î½Î±Î´, and so on, produced by the deflection of Î¼, Î½, from the circumference, is in the same ratio as the rest.Nevertheless, these will still be useful to those who wish, contrary to the geometrical usage, to proceed using least parts, with the aid of numbers.Since geometry has left us destitute, in order that we may have a  description of the line which has been born to us out of the theory of Chapter 45, let us go seek the assistance of a contrivance4 by fetching our vicarious hypothesis from Chapter 16, which places the lines Î±Î¼, Î±Î½, and so on, on which the planet stands, at the correct zodiacal places at the correct times, combining it with the present fictitious eccentric Î´Î¸Î», from which the theory of Chapter 45 has persuaded us that we have derived the correct length of the lines Î±Îµ, Î±Î¶; that is, Î±Î¼, Î±Î½.And besides, it is a good idea for the sake of shedding some light to compare the two hypotheses with one another, combined into one diagram.For although both are deceptive on certain points, each is useful for investigating particular truths (to the extent that they can be known at this point).And in this diagram, many things which have been said so far are brought together into a single view.Let A be the center of the earth (or of the sun, for Copernicus), AI the line of apsides, AD the eccentricity of the point of the equant.And although it was denied in Chapter 19 that the point D could remain fixed, and AD the same, this is to be understood as true only if DA is bisected.But if we remain at liberty to divide DA as we please, as in Chapter 16, then this point can remain fixed.Therefore, let AD be divided in the ratio found in Chapter 16.Let the point of division be C, and let AC be \n",

       "), and about center B with radius CH, let another eccentric IL be described, which in this chapter I have also called a fiction,*  for computing the correct distances.This is the one which in the diagram before the last was described as Î´Î¸Î», about center Î². And let the mean anomaly, which was previously proposed to us in the form of time, be transferred from D to B, and the straight line BF be drawn from B parallel to the former DH.And let the point of intersection F of the new eccentric be connected with A.Therefore, by what was said in this Chapter 46, AF will be the distance of the planet at F from the center of the sun at A, which the hypothesis of Chapter 45 requires.But the angle BAF is false, and the zodiacal position of AF is false.For at the selected time and mean anomaly the planet is not found on AF.Before, however, the true line of the planet was AH, and the distance AH was false.So about center A with distance AF let the arc FG be described, intersecting AH at G. Thus the line AG, constituted by two manifestly false hypotheses, is nevertheless true in its position beneath the zodiac, and its length is consonant with the hypothesis of Chapter 45.Thus through the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16, which consists of the points A, C, D, and the eccentric H, we have made up for the defect of geometry, which was unable to show us the position of the line AG (onto which the correct distance AF is to be transferred) which we required of the hypothesis of Chapter 45.One might ask, \"Couldn't we, in the former diagram just as well as in the  latter, take as given the point Î³ of uniform motion, and from it draw Î³Î¼, Î³Î½, Î³Î¿, Î³Ï, Î³Ï parallel to Î²Îµ, Î²Î¶, Î²Î¸, Î²Î¹, Î²Îº, and draw the arcs ÎµÎ¼, Î¶Î½, Î¸Î¿, Î¹Ï, ÎºÏ intersecting these parallels?And then understand the points of intersection to be the determinate places and positions of the distances?The answer is no.For in so doing we shall err considerably in transferring the distances too high up, as is easily seen in the latter diagram.For in it the line AH containing the true distances AF is lower than the line DH from the point of uniform motion D parallel to BF.Whichever of the described ways is used for delineating the line possessing  the body of the planet, it now follows that this way indicated by the points Î´, Î¼, Î½, Î¿, Ï, Ï, Î», is truly oval, not the elliptical one to which the mechanics give that name from the egg (ovum), contrary to correct usage.For an egg is rotated  about two vertices, one more blunt, the other sharper, and is visibly inclined at the sides.It is such a figure, I say, that we have created.For the planet is fast at Î», slow at Î´, and less fast at the former than it is slow at the latter.For there are more of the long distances exceeding the semidiameter than there are of the short ones (for they are longer up through 92âÂ° ^6.and then shorter for 87âÂ°, as can be demonstrated from the theory presented in Chapter 29).But in addition, that greater number of long [distances] is crowded into a narrower arc of the eccentric by being translated upwards, while these fewer [shorter] ones are spread out into a larger arc.So that to a mean anomaly of 92âÂ°*,  which contains 92âÂ° of distance,7 there corresponds an eccentric anomaly of about 87âÂ°.The remaining 87âÂ° of mean anomaly, with the same amount of distances shorter than the radius, is scattered over the remaining angle at the center of the eccentric, 92âÂ°.Consequently, the short distances near perihelion  are farther from one another than are the longer ones at aphelion.So even if the ratio between two neighboring perihelial distances remained constant, the part cut off from the circle would nevertheless be thinner about Îµ, Î¼, Î´ than about Ï, Îº, Î» ^8.For the short ones are transposed into the position of the longer ones in a shorter space at Î´ than at Î». But in addition, the distances themselves of the equal parts of the epicycle near to perihelion are in a greater ratio to one another than the distances of the parts near aphelion ^9.For it was demonstrated in Chapter 40 above that the conchoidal area is wider in its lower part than in its upper.Therefore, the conchoid must be thinned in greater steps over a shorter space at its lower point than at its upper, and in addition those greater intervals are compared to shorter lines.So on both counts the ratio is increased.With so many causes concurring, it appears that the part cut off from our eccentric circle is much wider below than above, at an equal distance from the apsides.Anyone can easily explore this using numbers, or by a mechanical delineation, by assuming some appreciable eccentricity.*Chapter 47An attempt is made to find the quadrature of the oval-shaped plane which Chapter 45 produced, and which we have been busying ourselves to describe in Chapter 46; and through the quadrature, a method of finding the equationsWe have accomplished nothing if, from the hypothesis we have taken, and the physical causes of Chapter 45, which we follow here as true, we shall not have constructed the correct equations, no less than the distances.But the equation is compounded from the parallaxes of the points on the eccentric and the elapsed time.The former of these I am accustomed to call the optical  part of the equation, and the latter, the physical part.Now the elapsed time, even if it is really something different, is certainly measured most easily (if not most perfectly) by the plane area circumscribed by the planet's path.We therefore turn to the measurement of the plane area of the eccentric ovoid, the rules for delineating which have been laid down already.Now there is going to be something lacking in our account that prevents our stating the true measure of this time.(For at the circumference of the ovoid the lines that join the parts of its circumference with the source of power are even more inclined  than on the circle.This is even true as well of the lines that are drawn from the center of the eccentric to those same parts of the ovoid, although otherwise the radii from the center to the circumference of a perfect circle make perfect right angles.)1 But the consequence of this is that the sum of the distances is not exactly measured by the plane surface, nor are the arcs of the ovoid exactly proportional to the distances.All these things will be clear from a rereading of Chapters 40 and \n",

       " guess as to how small this discrepancy is going to turn out to be, however, can be grasped from Ch.43.And how else can we measure this plane surface, compare it to the plane surface of a circle, and divide it into prescribed parts, unless we find a square equal to the trimmed-off part, or the lunule cut off?Here we will have to summon up from tragedy a deus, or rather a sort of ratio, ex machina,2 to teach us how to manufacture a quadrature of the ovoid, or of its border in the last diagram but oneâthat is, the lunule Î´Î¿Î»Î¸âwhose removal from the surface of the circle generates the ovoid Î´Î¿Î».And just as I called upon the geometers before in Ch.40 for the area of the conchoid, and begged their assistance, I do so again now for the ovoid (or, if you prefer, the \"metopoid\"3).If our figure were a perfect ellipse, the job would have been done by Archimedes, who demonstrates in his book On Spheroids, prop.6, 7, and 8, that the area of an ellipse is to the area of a circle sharing a common major diameter with the ellipse, as the rectangle contained by the diameters (or the \"figure\"4 of the section) is to the square on the circle's diameter.But let the figure be a perfect ellipse, for they hardly differ.Let us see what follows.I say, therefore, that the lunule Î´Î¿Î»Î¸ cut off from the semicircle will turn out to be imperceptibly greater than the small semicircle whose semidiameter is the eccentricity itself, Î±Î², or 9264.For let Î±Î² be bisected at Ï (as in Ch.29), and from Ï let ÏÏ go out perpendicular to Î±Î².Let Î± and Î² be connected to Ï. Now let Î³Ï extend parallel to Î²Ï, and let Î²Ï, Î±Ï be joined.And about center Î± with radius Î±Ï let the arc ÏÏ be drawn, intersecting Î±Ï at Ï and Î²Ï at Î¾.Now since the point Ï is equally remote from Î± and Î², we are (following the Arabs in using the term most properly) at the middle elongation, that is, at the average distance of the planet Ï from the sun Î±. And because Î³Ï is parallel to Î²Ï, the point Ï on the line Î±Ï (in the diagram of the previous chapter) is the genuine and most true position of the translation of Î±Ï to Î±Ï.Therefore Ï is also the point of the planet's average distance.Hence, the little part of the line Î²Ï between Ï and the circumference is the measure of the breadth of the lunule about the middle elongation, while the small line Î¾Ï is greater than this breadth by some imperceptible magnitude.Let a perpendicular be drawn from Î² to Î±Ï, and let it be Î²Ï.I say that Î¾Ï, a part of the line Î²Ï, is twice Î±Ï.For let Ï and Ï be joined, and from Ï let ÏÏ come out perpendicular to Î²Ï.Similarly, from Î¾ let Î¾Ï come out perpendicular to Î±Ï.Since the straight line Î±Î³ intersects the parallels Î³Ï, Î²Ï, [angles] Î²Î³Ï and Î±Î²Ï will be equal.And Î³Î² is equal to Î±Î² by construction.But also, Î²Ï is equal to Î±Ï, for both are equal to Î²Ï by construction.Therefore, triangle Î³ÏÎ² is congruent with triangle Î²ÏÎ±.Thus, Î³Ï will be equal to Î²Ï.But they are parallel by construction.Thus Î²Î³ and ÏÏ, which connect the ends  of equal parallels on the same side, will also be parallel and equal.But Î²Î³ is also equal to Î±Î².Therefore, Î±Î² and ÏÏ are also equal and parallel.Consequently, Î²Ï and Î±Ï will also be parallel.And because the angles at Ï and Ï are right, and the base ÏÏ is equal to the base Î²Î±, and the angle Î²Î±Ï or Î²Î±Ï is equal to the angle ÏÏÎ² or ÏÏÏ, Î±Ï and ÏÏ will therefore be equal, as well as Î²Ï and ÏÏ perpendicular to them.Again, because the lines ÏÏ and Î¾Ï are equal, being parallels between parallels,5 while Î²Ï and Î±Î¾ are equal, and the angles at Ï and Ï are right, the remaining sides of the triangles Î²Ï and Î±Ï will also be equal.But Î²Î¾ and ÏÏ are also equal, for they are parallels between the parallels Î²Ï, Î¾Ï.Therefore, when the equals Î²Î¾ and ÏÏ are subtracted [from Î²Ï and Î±Ï], the remainders Î¾Ï and Î±Ï will be equal.But before, ÏÏ and Î±Ï were also equal.Therefore, Î¾Ï is twice Î±Ï.With these things demonstrated, we shall draw nearer to our proposition.And to the diameter ÏÎ² of the circle (which should be understood to be extended to the other circumference), a straight line is drawn perpendicular from a point Ï on the circumference, namely, ÏÏ.Therefore, as ÏÏ is to ÏÏ, so is ÏÏ to the remainder of the diameter.Therefore, the rectangle contained by ÏÏ and the remaining part of the diameter is equal to the square on ÏÏ.And because the square on ÏÏ, that is, Î±Î², is equal to the [sum of the] squares on ÏÏ and ÏÏ, when equals are added, the rectangle contained by ÏÏ and the entire diameter is equal to the square on Î±Î².And because ÏÎ¾ is twice ÏÏ, the rectangle contained by ÏÎ¾ (which is imperceptibly greater than the breadth of the lunule ÏÏ) and the semidiameter ÏÎ² is equal to the square on Î±Î².But the rectangle contained by Î¾Ï, ÏÎ² is the difference of the rectangle contained by Î¾Î², Î²Ï and the square on Î²Ï.And the lunules are also the difference between the areas of the ellipse and the circle.And as the rectangle contained by Î¾Î², Î²Ï is to the square on Î²Ï, so is the area of the ellipse to the area of the circle, approximately.*  Therefore also, as the square on Î²Ï is to the rectangle Î¾Ï, ÏÎ², that is, the square on Î±Î², so is the area of the circle to the area of the two lunules, approximately.And by permutation, as the square on Î²Ï is to the area of the circle, so is the square on Î±Î² to the area of the lunules, approximately.But as the square on Î²Ï is to the area of the circle of which Î²Ï is the radius, so is the square on Î±Î² to the circle of which Î±Î² is the radius.Therefore, the area of the circle of which Î±Î² is the radius imperceptibly exceeds the two lunules ÏÏ cut off.It exactly equals the lunules Î³Î¾Ï which are a little wider than they should be, because Î¾Ï is imperceptibly longer than ÏÏ, as was said at the beginning.So, granted what we have supposed, namely, that the area of the ellipse differs imperceptibly from the area of our ovoid, as a result of the compensation between the excess of the ovoid over the ellipse in the upper regions, and the defect in the lower regions,âthese, as I said, being granted, we have squared our \"new moon\"6 figures, and thus also the ovoidal one.Or, properly speaking, we have \"circled\" it.For Archimedes teaches us the ratio of the circle and the square.We shall now put this to use, thus.Since the area of the ovoid is less than the area of the circle by the area of the small circle described by the eccentricity, let the area of this small circle be computed next.Now the ratio of the areas is the duplicate of the ratio of the diameters.And as Î²Ï, \n",

       " equivalent to 360 equal parts of the periodic time.Those things which have been said so far are entirely consonant with the opinion of Chapter 45.Nevertheless, to use them, it is not enough to know the magnitude of the area of the ovoid.Indeed, we need also understand how to divide it, from the center Î² or the point Î±, in a given ratio.For example, in the previous diagram, let the point Î¸ be taken, and let the planet be observed on the line Î±Î¸, but let it recede from the circumference Î¸ towards the sun Î±. Therefore, given the eccentricity Î±Î² and the angle Î¸Î±Î², and supposing that the planet is at the point Î¸ of the circumference, the angle Î¸Î²Î´ will be given, and hence also the sector of the perfect circle, namely, Î¸Î´Î², and the area of the triangle Î¸Î²Î±, that is, the whole area Î¸Î´Î± which (with the exceptions in Chapter 40 above) ought to have been the measure of the time elapsed while the planet moves from Î´ to Î¸, if the planet had gone in a perfect circle.But because it describes an oval inside the circle, not embracing the full area of the perfect circle, so, exactly as just a moment ago we needed knowledge of the area of the whole ovoid, we now need to know what portion of the ovoid is contained between the lines Î´Î± and Î±Î¸, that is, what portion the area of the part Î´Î¸ of the lunule is of the area that measures the two lunules, namely, of the area of the small circle on the eccentricity.For when this is subtracted from the portion of the circle cut off by the lines Î±Î¸, Î±Î´, the remainder will be the portion of the ovoid cut off by the same lines Î±Î¸, Î±Î´.Thus, finally, the whole oviform will be correctly compared to its part Î´Î±Î¸ in order to find the time, or the slowing of the planet, which occurs between the lines Î±Î´ and Î±Î¸.Once again, now, where is the geometer who will show us how to do this?Let the last diagram of Chapter 40 be presented again, in which CD is the semicircle stretched out into a straight line, divided into equal parts, and DE is a quadrant.And on the line EA from E let some line [EÎ¿] be extended towards A which bears the ratio to the longest line BA (the one on the line CA) which that BA has to BC.And let the rest, GÎ¼, HÎ½, IÏ, KÏ, be set up similarly in the appropriate magnitudes, having the breadth of the lunule at any given position, so that GÎ¼ is a little shorter than KÏ, and HÎ½ shorter than IÏ (although they are the same distance from C and D), in accordance with what was demonstrated in Ch.46.Thus the lunule, insofar as it shortens the distances, will be delineated and unfolded partwise onto a straight line.And because the whole space between CD and AA is twice the area of the stretched-out semicircle CD, the geometer should consider whether the small space between the curve CÎ¼Î½Î¿ÏÏD and the straight line CED is also going to be twice the lunule cut off from the area of the circle.Nothing appears to contradict the possibility of this being so.For when the lunule  really is a lunule, CD is then curved inwards while retaining its same length.But CÎ¼Î½Î¿ÏÏD, which was just constructed longer than CED, is then much shorter.Therefore, the lunule then contains a much smaller area than now.But in fact, O geometers, this is not a demonstration.Therefore, you will assist me.And if this turns out to be true, you will teach me a method by which may be known the magnitude, not only of the whole small area between the straight line CED and the curve CÎ¿D, which I have so far said is equal to the small circle on the eccentricity (for two lunules are equal to the small circle, and this small area is now supposed to be twice one of the lunules), but also of any part of it, at any given length of the parts CG, CH; and by which this may be compared to the area between CD and BB.So once again, as before in \n",

And let B and Î½ be joined to Î±. Now as Î²Ï is to Î²Î¾ so is CB to CÎ½, from the assumption of a perfect ellipse and Prop.5 of On Spheroids, and also as BC is to CÎ½ so is the area BÎ´C to the area Î½Î´C.But also as BC is to CÎ½, so is the area BÎ±C to the area Î½Î±C.Therefore, as Î²Ï is to Î²Î¾, so is the area Î±ÎÎ´ to the area \n",

       " also gave truer distances, namely, the last one.And, what may seem strange, by a slight increase in the eccentricity it becomes equivalent to the Ptolemaic method, using a stable equant point and a bisected eccentricity.And since we convicted this Ptolemaic method of error above, the physical method, which is in effect the same as the Ptolemaic, must also be somewhat askew of the truth.And it does indeed make the planet slow near the apsides, and too swift about the middle longitudes.This is the first argument by which it is proved that either the opinion of Chapter 45 is erroneous, or it has been transposed into numbers by an erroneous method.But because the plane area of the circle is not equivalent to the aggregate of all the distances, nor is the oval figure that, according to the opinion of Ch.45, Mars describes, a perfect ellipse, as we have assumed, the causes for the departure from the truth are still hidden.For in addition to these two causes  of error in the calculation, the error can be consistent with a third cause, of the very foundation, the opinion expressed in Ch.45.So we have not yet set up equations according to the law of the opinion of Ch.45, and have not yet done justice to the hypothesis we took up there, because we have been abandoned by geometry.Therefore, we cannot yet charge it with being erroneous.For a calculation that is going to do this points to the rule of innocence for itself ^12.Chapter 48A method of computing the eccentric equations by a numerical measure and division of the circumference of the ovoid described in Ch.46.So, since the calculation taken up in the preceding chapter was abandoned by geometry on so many counts, so as to be suspected of culpability for the excesses and defects which we noted in the eccentric equations in that chapter, I finally sought refuge in the numberings of arithmetic, by which I attempted to avoid the obstacles which stood in the way of our describing the path of the planet in Chapter 46.For first, because the area was not the perfect measure of the sum of the distances, I dismissed the area and computed the distances of individual parts of the equally divided circumference.Second, since the ratio did not remain the same when any given number of terms of the geometrical proportion were added, I therefore investigated each individual proportion separately for each distance in relation to its minimal arc.Third, since the sum of any particular number of distances in Ch.46 could not be established geometrically, I established it arithmetically.For there was no difficulty in that.Fourth, in carrying this out I had no dealings with sectors, whether circular or oval, and therefore it could obviously no longer be a hindrance to me that these sectors differ from one another.And so, with renewed effort, I brooded upon it, in order to know at least at the end whether the equations shown to us by the vicarious hypothesis also follow from the hypothesis under consideration, which gives the correct distances (that is, the one following the opinion of Chapter 45.)I approached the matter thus.About center B, with radius BD, let the circle DGR be described, in which the line of apsides is DR, and A is the source of power or the center of the sun.On the circle DG let the point G be chosen, and joined to B and A. And at first, let the angle GBD be the measure of the time, for computing the distance.Consequently, GA will be the true distance of the planet from A, although the planet has not moved all the way from D to G.

       "), corresponding to the entire oval path of Mars.Now about center A, with radius AG, let an arc, GC, be described towards D. And because the greater the distance the shorter the planet's path, when the distance of an arc of the circle DG is given (which arc is now, when we are computing the distance GA, nothing but the measure of the time), the length of the oval path DC will also be given, which the planet describes in the time DG under consideration (which is a simple anomaly of 1Â°).For as the length of the whole of the oval circumference is to the sum of all the distances, so is the distance of the arc DC (found by the arc DG) to the length of its oval arc DC.For it was proved in Ch.33 above, and used in Chapter 46 (where the foundations for this operation were laid) that the arcs traversed are inversely as the distances.However, I applied this precaution: that AD and AG, the distances of the ends C and D of the arc from A, be added, and the mean of the sum be taken as the genuine distance of the whole arc DC.For letsome eccentric circle DK described about center B, be divided into any number of parts, say, at D, G, L, K, Î, N, and from the beginnings of the parts let arcs be drawn about the center of the world A until they intersect the lines drawn from A to the ends of the arcs, as DO, GP, LQ, KR,MS, NT.The areas on the left semicircle, ADO,AGP, ALQ, will be greater than they should be, while the arcs on the right, ANT, AMS, AKR, will be less than they should be.So, when least arcs are in question, the one is compensated by the other, so that TNA and ODA are very nearly equal to the area GDNA.Next, the length DC in the previous diagram being thus given, to correspond to the given time DG and to the distance GA or CA, the angle of equated anomaly CAD now also should be found.Let C be joined to B, and let AC be extended to E, where it intersects the circle, and BC to the intersection F. It was therefore not enough to know the length DC.The angle CBD ought to have been investigated as well.For because CD is shorter than FD, CD does not measure the angle FBD, or CBD.And on the other hand, even though CD is shorter than FD, if you place an observer at B it appears from B to be just as much a measure of the angle CBD as is FD.But according to the demonstrations of Chapter 32, it is true within all limits of sense perception that to the extent that FD is farther from B than is CD, FD is also longer than CD.Also, it is true within the same limits of sense perception (for the present purposes it does not matter how acute) that CE and CF are equal (though in the truth of the matter CE is longer than CF, which is drawn through the center, by Euclid Book III prop.7).I have therefore supposed, first, that CD and FD are equal, and both are a measure of the angle CBD or FBD, or even EBD, as if the arc EF were  imperceptible.Thus, from knowing CD, the angle EBD was given.Therefore, in triangle EBA, from the angle EBA and the sides EB, BA, I sought the length of AE, whence I subtracted AC or AG computed earlier, and the remainder was CE or CF, the amount that the other end of CD approached the center B. So, when CE is bisected (for this can be done within the limits of perception) the approach of CD towards B was known, if it were to approach equally at all its points.But from the amount of approach, the optical parallax, or the apparent size of CD, was also given: that is, the angle CBD now corrected, which was previously assumed to be a little smaller, though in our numbers there is no error.Therefore, given the angle CBD, now corrected, which is the supplement of angle CBA, and the side CA, and the eccentricity BA, the equated anomaly CAD, which was sought, was given.It was impossible to use this method to establish independently any equation other than the first, at a mean anomaly of 1Â°.All the rest, all the way to the 180th, always presupposed that the equation immediately preceding was known.I can't imagine anyone reading this not being overcome by the tedium of it even in the reading.So the reader may well judge how much vexation we (my calculator and I) derived hence, as we thrice followed this method through the 180Â° of anomaly, changing the eccentricity each time.But the foundation of this calculation has not yet been laid out.For I said that I presupposed knowledge of the length of the whole oval.Whence, then, is this known?As for me, once I had descended to this clumsy numbering procedure, I did not manage to avoid clumsily presupposing the length, and then, when the whole thing was complete, seeing whether in the 180th operation I came out with an apparent position of more than 180Â°, or less.For if it had come out at exactly 180Â°, I knew that the length I had assumed for the oval was good, but if it was less, I had assumed it to be too small, and if more, greater.Nevertheless, we are not left without a kind of geometrical helping hand for making a good guess as to the oval's length.For as BD is to BA let BA be to DH, extended from D towards B. By what was demonstrated in Chapter 46, the rectangle contained by the breadth of the lunule and the semidiameter of the circle is nearly equal to the square on the eccentricity.Therefore, by Euclid VI.17, the eccentricity is the mean proportional between the breadth of the lunule and the semidiameter.But this is how the diagram is set up.Therefore, DH is the breadth of the lunule.Let the half of DH also be taken, and extended from B towards D, and let it be BI.And about center I, with radius ID, let the circle DK be described, touching the eccentric at D. And also, about center B, with radius BH, let the circle HK be described, touching the previous circle at K. It is obvious that the circle HK is smaller than DK, and the circle DGR is greater than DK.And because circular circumferences are to one another as their semidiameters, as BD is to DI and BH, so is the greater circle DG to the smaller circles DK and KH.But DI is the arithmetic mean between DB and HB, because BI is half of HD.Therefore, the circle DK too, touching the smaller and larger circles described about the same center B, is the arithmetic mean between those circles that it touches.If the oval path is continued, by hypothesis it will be tangent to the greater circle at aphelion D and perihelion R, and to the smaller circle HK at the middle elongations.Thus, it is greater than the smaller circle HK, and smaller than the greater circle DR.It is therefore likely that the oval circumference is not much different from the length of the circular circumference DK.The following demonstration, however, makes one believe it to be a little larger.Let the mean proportional between BH and BD be taken, and let it be BO, and about center B with radius BO let the circle OP be described.Thus, by Archimedes, On Spheroids 5, the area of this circle OP will be equal to the area of an ellipse whose longer semidiameter is BD, and whose shorter is BH.And because the greatest of all figures of equal perimeter is the circle, conversely (in the common significance of the term), of figures with equal area, the one with the shortest perimeter will be the circle.Therefore, since the proposed figures, namely, the ellipse which has semidiameters DB, BH, and the circle OP, are equal in area, from the evidence just presented, the circumference of the ellipse will be longer than the circumference of the circle OP.But BO is imperceptibly less than ID, since BO is taken as the geometrical mean, and ID the arithmetic mean, between the same terms.For by the theory presented in Euclid's Book V,2 since BO is the mean proportional between HB, BD, as the lesser, HB, is to the greater, BD, so is HO, the excess of the mean, to the defect, OD.3 Therefore, since HB is less than BD, HO will also be less than OD.But BI is equal to the half of HD.Therefore, BI is greater than HO, and less than OD.Therefore, to the common semidiameter HB of the least circle HK unequals are added, namely, less than the half of DH to make BO, and half of DH to make DI.Therefore, DI is greater than BO.Thus the circle DK is greater than OP.But it is only imperceptibly greater, since DH is less than a hundredth of DB.Therefore, on the supposition that these circles are superabundantly equal, and on the supposition that the oval is a perfect ellipse, the circumference of the oval will be a little longer than the circle DK, and certainly longer than the circle OP.And because in Ch.47 above DH was \n",

Now from FD, as if it were a measure of the angle CBD, and from AC, AB, we would find the equated anomaly CAD by a shorter path than before.But the reader should know that these two variations do not keep in step.For the optical amplification which arises from the approach of the path DC to the center B, happens chiefly about the middle elongations, and hardly at all at aphelion and perihelion.Contrariwise, the shortening of the oval path, which arises from the incursion of the planet towards the center, is about the same everywhere.For two opposite distances at the middle elongations of the eccentric add up to the sum of two near the line of apsides, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.But the arcs of the oval circumference are in the inverse ratio of the distances.Therefore, two of these arcs, at the middle elongations, will be equal to two other arcs, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.If these arcs of the oval path are equal, the diminution of the arcs at all four places will be approximately equal also.This is confirmed by experiment.For if the defect of the oval semicircle is 45' 15\", the defect of the 180th part of the oval would be about 14\" about aphelion.And the amplification from the approach of the oval does not equal one second at aphelion.So, as concerns the proposed ocular estimation of the diagram, it is not quite as simple as was said in the objection, that the shortening of the oval and its optical amplification compensate one another.This would indeed be so if all the arcs of the oval path were presented directly when seen from center B. But this happens only at the middle elongations.Near the apsides, on the other hand, these arcs are not at the same distance at both ends.Therefore, they are not made to be as much greater in their appearance, by approaching, as they are made smaller by being shortened.So, following this method, I constructed equations for Mars at all degrees of the eccentric, and I did it three times.For the first time I took an eccentricity of \n",

       ", which is half of the eccentricity of the equant in Ch.16) I went through the whole job again.First, the distances GA or CA were constructed at the individual whole numbers of degrees of equated distance anomaly GAD.Next, these were brought over to GD or GBD, the whole number of degrees of mean distance anomaly.Third, adjacent pairs, such as GA, AD, were added.Fourth, division by those divisors was carried out one hundred eighty times.The sum is 358Â° 28' 30\", which is the length of the oval path.Fifth, the individual arcs of the oval path were added to one another in order.Sixth, the optical amplifications were borrowed from the previous unsuccessful operation, since I saw that over two computations they differed hardly at all.So these, too were added to the above sum, in order.Seventh, the sums of the arcs were increased by the sums of the optical amplifications.Eighth, from the angle CBD thus found about the center of the eccentric B, and the distance CA as opposite side, and the eccentricity AB as the third side, I sought out the 180 angles of optical equation ACB, whence the total equations and the equated anomalies were derived.The resulting anomalies were:So the eccentricity still can be increased, and up above, [moving] from aphelion, the planet is made to be slightly slower than it should be, and the  same near perihelion, and therefore it is swifter than it should be at the middle elongations, as was also found before in Chapter 47.So too many of the distances seem to be collected near the apsides, and not as many as required, or not as long as required, about the middle elongations.But a consideration of this follows in its proper place.So, when I saw that the more skillfully and the more conveniently the physical causes, introduced in Ch.45, are called upon for directing the principles of calculation, the closer I always have approached to the true equations provided by the vicarious hypothesis of Ch.16, I greatly congratulated myself, and was confirmed in the opinion of Chapter 45.On the other hand, since I was revulsed at the multiple contrivances4 with which I contended in this chapter, I did not rest until I had established a more certain and direct way, and at the same time I began to suspect that what the opinion of Chapter 45 had required had in no way been achieved by the calculation.Chapter 49A critical examination of the previous method for the equations, and a more concise method, based upon the principles constituting the oval in the opinion of Chapter 45.So, in order to see the cause of the contrivance1 in this method, now fully presented, consider upon what foundations it rests.The planet is supposed to move uniformly on the epicycle, and to be swept around by the sun nonuniformly, according to the distance.From these two principles of motion, the oval path arises.But this method does not allow one to know what portion of the oval path corresponds to a given time, even if the distance of that portion be known, unless the length of the whole oval be known from the beginning.And the length of the oval cannot be known, except through the measure of the incursion of the planet from the circumference of the circle at the sides.But further, the measure of this incursion is not known before it is known what portion of the oval path is traversed in any given time.This, as you see, begs the question, and in our operation we presupposed what was being sought, namely, the length of the oval.This is not just a fault in our understanding, but is utterly alien to the primeval ordainer of the planetary courses: we have hitherto not found such an ungeometrical2 preconception3 in the rest of his works.Therefore a different approach must be taken for calling the opinion of Chapter 45 to the calculations, or if this cannot be done, the opinion itself will totter owing to its being suspected of circularity of argument.From this consideration the implication has occurred to us that in using the uniform measure of time, we divided the composite oval path into unequal parts, and thus measured out the parts of this composite oval, unequal  but equated again by the compensation of the distances, by the equal increments of time of the planet on all of them.And indeed, we had among our presuppositions that only the other power (that which is from the sun), intensifies according to distance, the power proper to the planet doing so not at all.But now, in this undertaking, we in a way encumber both forces with this relation to the distances, because we give the common work of the two, the oval, to the planet, according to the measure of the distances to be traversed.Therefore, although we have approached rather close to the truth in the effect of this method, we have nothing in which to glory that the opinion of Chapter 45 has been expressed by it if we are abandoned by reason.We would therefore have appeared to be going about our business more correctly if, dismissing the composite oval and the quadrature of its area, the subject matter of Chapters 46,47, and 48, we were to convert the calculation to the principles themselves of the oval path, assumed in Chapter 45.Let Chapter 45 be taken up again, and about A, the center of the sun's body, with radius AD, let the circle DG of the center of the epicycle be described; and another, with center A, and radius AB, the circle of the aphelion; in which AGB is the line of apsides, and let the planet, when it is at aphelion,4 be at B. Now let some time have passed from when the planet was at B, and let its measure be CDE, the angle on the epicycle, in order that as the aphelion of the epicycle B is translated to C, and the center of the epicycle G to D, the planet will have moved on the epicycle from C to E. Therefore, in order to know the angle DAB at the time CDE, consider that the planet has passed across from B to E by two powers.One made it move nearer the sun, and at the same time also drew it away from the line AC or AD, on which it had been previously, when AC was at AB.The other moved the planet forward alongwith the center of the epicycle, so that the center D of the epicycle was on the line AC, although it was formerly on AB.Now the power that drives the center of the epicycle around in a time designated by 360Â°, moves through 360Â°, or four right angles, about A, owing to the sum of 360 distances.Therefore, the sum of any number of distances being given from the time CDE, as before, the angle DAB will also be given.For the impression which the sun makes upon the body of the planet through the mediation of the distancesAB, AE, is also presumed to make the same impression upon the center of the epicycle GD.This is because if the planet had not disengaged itself from the ray of power AB or AC and move towards B, but only descended towards the sun, it would then still be at the point F*  on AC, on which line the center of the epicycle D also lies.And it has disengaged itself by the law of the epicycle, at the distance DE and the angle CDE (for this is prescribed by the opinion of Chapter 45, under which we are operating here).Thus by a kind of fiction for itself it places the center of its epicycle at D. For we have said in Ch.39 how it is to be imagined that the power or fictitious radii of power AB,AC, and so on, serve as a position for the planet.Now, though, the ratio of the arcs BE of the oval path to the whole oval is not quite the same as the ratio of the corresponding arcs GD of the perfect circle to the whole circle.But neither is it true that as BC is to the whole perimeter of the circle BC so is the arc BF of the oval to the whole oval.But this should not stand in our way, for BE, and BF too, are composed of two powers, and if anything is disturbed in the proportion this comes from the planet's making its  own descent on the circumference of the epicycle (following the opinion of Chapter 45).For if the planet had remained at the highest point of its epicycle, and had been subject to the same motive force from the sun, adumbrated by AB, AE, which is nonuniform (which indeed cannot happen simultaneously, for when the distance of the planet from the sun remains the same, the motive strength from the sun remains the same), then a perfect arc of a greater circle BC would have been described, whose ratio to the whole BC is the same which the arc GD has to the whole GD.I am indeed aware that if the planet is supposed to be on a smaller perimeter, that of the center of the epicycle DG, it will go much faster.But that is not a reason for assigning a greater speed to the center of the epicycle.For, by supposition, the center of the epicycle moves, not in its own right, since it is not a body, but because of the planet.It is thus presupposed that the planet moves its own body away from the solar rays according to the law of the epicycle, and makes use of certain rays of power from the sun for its position (ideas which were indeed rejected in Ch.39, but taken up again in Ch.45 in considerably altered form, and which are retained here in order to explain my attempts).On this basis, the foundation of the subsequent calculation is sound, whatever its result might be.For the oval is present here no less than before, since DE and AB do not remain parallel.For to the extent that the long distances AB, AE exceed the medium distances AG, AD, the arc DG, or the angle DAG, is made less than the angle CDE, the measure of the time.Thus DE inclines towards B, and E consequently makes an incursion from the circumference of the circle towards BA.For by Chapter 2, if DE had remained parallel to AB, then E would have been on the circumference.This gives rise to the following method.Let the distances be found for each degree of mean anomaly.The method you have in Ch.39 above, and I also used it above in Ch.47 and 48.First, distances are found for nonintegral degrees of mean anomaly, or CE.Then, by interpolation, they are carried over to integral degrees of CE.If you find this meandering route annoying, and if the greater labor of the direct way pleases you, and if, further, you want to have the whole thing presented in one overview, proceed thus.Measure the time, or the artificial units expressing time, which is the astronomers' mean anomaly, on the epicycle CE, from its aphelion C, in a direction opposite the series of signs ^5.Thus the angle ADE, or its supplement CDE, is given as a whole number of degrees of mean anomaly.The radius AD is also given as \n",

       " and dividing the product by each of the distances in the semicircle, 180 times, or  better, by half the sum of adjacent pairs of distances (following the advice given in Ch.48), yields the angles of the center of the epicycle, DAG.Next, beginning from the two least values of DAG, add them, and to the sum add the third, and again add the fourth to the sum of the three preceding, and so on, until you have accumulated all the 180 degrees.And if your final sum comes out to be exactly 180Â° it will prove to you that you did everything right, never departing from the instructions.And let these sums of yours, which are the angles DAG, again be inscribed in a catalog with the corresponding mean anomalies in the margin, for ready reference.So, since an integral equation is to be computed, that is, the equated anomaly for a given mean anomaly, first, with the mean anomaly CDE measured on the epicycle, you extract the angle DAG or CAB from the latter catalog, the one with the sum of the angles.And with the same mean anomaly, you also extract the part of the equation CAE from the previous catalog.And when this is subtracted from the angle DAB, the remainder is the equated anomaly EAB.The variations in the other semicircle are known.In this manner, at 6Near the apsides the planet is made to be slower than it should be, and near the middle elongations swifter than it should be.You will say that we have come out worse, since in Ch.48 we came nearer the truth in our results.But, my good man, if I were concerned with results, I could have avoided all this work, being content with the vicarious hypothesis.Be it known, therefore, that these errors are going to be our path to the truth.Meanwhile, let us be assured that at last we have brought the physical causes, which we supposed in Chapter 45, at least once to a calculation entirely free of error.At the same time, moreover, the calculation of Chapter 47, above, is confirmed, since this one is equivalent; and it is certain that what we held in suspicion there as ungeometrical,7 have not obstructed us in any perceptible way.Thus if there remains any discrepancy between these equalities and the truth, it is to be attributed, not to the method of applying numbers, but to the opinion of Ch.45, whence these numbers flow.This is to say, not that the opinion itself has immediately become totally false, but just that we have been hasty.For instead of waiting for the plenary judgement of the observations, when we understood the planet's path to be oval we immediately seized upon  a certain quality for that oval, solely on account of the elegance of the physical causes and the graceful uniformity of the epicyclic motion, which was falsely given credence.Now the manner in which the ultimate and truest opinion is to be brought to a calculation, and made to conform most closely to these chapters, will be told in its place.*  I am now going to complete the unfolding of my remaining trials.Chapter 5The extent to which this arrangement of orbs, using either an equant or a second epicycle, while remaining entirely one and the same (or very nearly one and the same), can present different phenomena at one and the same instant, according to whether the planets are observed at mean or at apparent opposition to the sun.This is done in two ways: one, in which the Ptolemaic and Copernican forms are equivalent, and another which is peculiar to the Copernican form.This latter, as it is further from our enterprise, we shall explain first, for it remains more allied to itself than the other.About center Î³, with radius Î³Î´, let an eccentric be described,  upon which, in the first instance, let Î±Î³ be the line of apsides, with Î± the observer, and let this line be extended to Îµ. And let Î³Î± be the magnitude of the eccentricity, or the radius of the greater Copernican epicycle (the equivalence of the two was discussed at the end of Ch.4, preceding).Next, about center Îµ, with radius ÎµÎ·, let the smaller epicycle be described, and since its center is at Îµ, let the planet be at Î·, falling on the line ÎµÎ³, so that it is not the star but the center of the epicycle bearing the star that runs along the eccentric ÎµÎ´.Thus, by Ch.4, it is the Copernican form that is expressed here.By Ch.3, we shall set up another that is equivalent to it in reality or in the indication of the exact planetary path, but is different in appearance.Thiswe shall do by moving the observer from Î±. By what was said at the end of Ch.3, we could do the same thing even if the observer were to remain at Î±, by moving the eccentric while keeping lines parallel, in such a way that the size of the eccentric remains constant and only its position changes.But we shall carry it to completion as we have begun it.Adopting a position for the observer not on the prior line of apsides (let it be Î²), such that Î²Î³ has a magnitude different from that of Î±Î³ (that is, a new eccentricity or new radius of the greater epicycle), let us draw a new line of apsides Î²Î´ through Î²Î³, and at Î´ let us describe an epicycle equal to the former.Here, although the center of the epicycle is at the apsis Î´, nonetheless we shall not place the planet at the point nearest Î³, as before, but, taking the measure of the angle ÎµÎ³Î´, we shall set out the angle Î¸Î´Î³ twice that size, in the direction of Îµ, and shall place the planet at Î¸, when the epicycle is at the apsis Î´. For this is where the planet would be, were the observer at Î± and the epicycle at Î´. In this way, the true compound planetary path remains the same to a hairâs breadth, while the appearance is altered.For when the lines of sight are inclined to one another, as Î²Î¸ and Î±Î¸ here, or Î²Î· and Î±Î·, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars.You may object that even when the lines of sight are parallel, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars, and it is therefore not essential that they be inclined to one another.I answer, this is indeed true, but in that case the space of the sphere of the stars intercepted between the two lines is not perceptible to the power of sight unless the distance between the parallels is perceptible in relation to the radius of the sphere of the stars.In the physical account, this must be posited in addition to what was said in Ch.3, in order to establish the identity of the path while the appearances are altered: the mind to which the smaller epicycle is committed pays attention to a point on the circuit different from the one regarded by the mind of the greater epicycle.For in the second position, the greater epicycle or the eccentricity returns to its starting point on the line Î²Î´, while the smaller epicycle does so on the line Î±Îµ which does not pass through the place of the observer.This is because, in the second position, the observer is located at Î², while in the first position, where the observer is located at Î±, both epicycles return to their starting points on the same line ÎµÎ±.The form of the hypothesis thus does not  remain simply the same physically in such a way that that the planet keeps the same path.But suppose you were going to simulate the same path in the second position by having both epicycles return to their starting point at the same line of apsides Î²Î´.If so, while the eccentric as well as the epicycle stay the same in both instances, the position of the planet on the epicycle will be different at every single moment.Thus, although in the second instance the form of Ptolemaic hypothesis presented is the same to a hairâs breadth, the actual path of the planet will be altered.Hence, it will be inferred below, even though the first inequality of the planets may be entirely accounted for by the compound hypothesis of Ch.4, it cannot happen that the first inequality have the same measure at the planetâs mean opposition to the sun as at apparent opposition, unless the planetâs orbit be moved from its own location at the same time (unlike the circles in the theory of the sun), or the Ptolemaic form of Ch.4 be changed.Maestlin made use of this form of transposition in constructing the table in Ch.15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum.For when Copernicus transformed the Ptolemaic [models] into his own general form of hypotheses, he supposed the observer to be stationed at some nearly motionless point near the sun, distant from the sunâs own body by the entire eccentricity of the solar orb.I, however, in adapting Copernicus to the subject matter of that book, needed a different fiction.The observer was to be imagined as transported from that point to the very center of the solar body, and from there (that is, from the body of the sun) the departures of the planetary bodies were to be computed, moving on the same path which the suppositions of Copernicus fashioned.But, as has just now been shown, by reason of the particular times my translation of the line of apsides did not effect exactly the same path.The difference, however, was very slight, and was clearly of no importance in that little book.For there the question concerned only the location of the path, which this procedure did not affect.As for the rest, in order to avoid confusion in what follows, I shall no longer make use of this Copernican eccentric, described by the center of the epicycle rather than the star.It differs from the planet's true path, which is higher at perigee and lower at apogee.The term \"eccentric\"  from now on we will use only to designate the actual path of the planet, or of the point to whose motion the first inequality belongs.In proceeding in this way, it is appropriate that we imagine only the Ptolemaic eccentric, or something like it.For it was shown in the fourth chapter that our computation of the equation, based upon the Ptolemaic form, will differ from the Copernican by only two minutes at most.Then, too, the procedure for computing the first inequality is easier in the Ptolemaic form than in the Copernican.Finally, as was said, this Ptolemaic form of the first inequality is better accommodated to nature herself and to our speculations that follow in the third and fourth parts.However, because of the equivalence, anyone who so chooses will always be able to supply in thought  the Copernican eccentric-cum-epicycle considered so far in this fifth chapter.I now proceed to the prior procedure for setting up the two sorts of equivalence that I have proposedâthe one common to the particular hypotheses of the authorities.I shall demonstrate this first in the Ptolemaic form.About center Î² let the Ptolemaic eccentric Î¹Î¶Î· be described, with Î¹Î² the line of apsides, Î± the observer, and Î³ the equalizing point ^1.Now when I say that the observer is at Î±, I mean it either as a fiction or as truth.Physically speaking, it is not so much the observer which is to be placed at Î± as the power which renders the planetary circuit around itself slow or swift according to the ratios of its proximity to Î±, as was said above.Let some point on the circumference not on the line of apsides (say, Î·) be connected with Î³, Î², and Î±. Let it be that about as many angles Î¹Î±Î· may be computed by this hypothesis throughout the entire circuit as are observed from Î±, and after certain periods of time, which the angle Î·Î³Î¹ measures uniformly.Later, in the second part, it will be shown how one can find, through astronomical observations, how great the angle Î·Î±Î¹ should be for any given \n",

       " let the observer or moving power be at some point not on the line Î¹Î±, and let this be Î´. Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about Î´ be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from Î´. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at Î´ square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered.But since it is certain that at one and the same time the planet traverses one and the same path in the heavens, not one seen to an observer at Î´ and another to an observer at Î±, it is also certain, as a consequence, that the planet cannot appear to both observers (both the one at Î± and the one at Î´) to be equally moved in the same time.For let Î¹Î· be a portion of the planetâs true path, and let the planet traverse this in a given time, say twenty days.Now since Î± is nearer Î¹Î· than Î´ is, Î¹Î· will appear greater at Î± than at Î´, by what is demonstrated in optics.Therefore, during the same twenty days the planet will appear to make greater progress to one who is at Î± than to one who is at Î´. And since any planet maintains a fixed and constant number of days in which it is returned to the same sidereal position, the slowness has to be compensated by a contrary speed.Therefore, since in the portion Î¹Î· the planet appears slower to one at Î´, it will in some other portion appear swifter to the one at Î´ than to one at Î±. Hence it happens that it appears slowest to the one at Î´ in one place, and to one at Î± in another.Nevertheless,  the planet itself can be truly slowest in but one place on its orbit.With these as preliminaries, the question is raised whether one and the same true path of the planet in the heavens (this is presupposed) can present two sets of appearances each proper to an observer, one at Î´ and the other at Î±, and each such as comply with and admit the Ptolemaic form of computation.If the planet were of equal speed at all parts of its orbit, the answer, according to what was said in Ch.3, is yes.But since in terms of real and true increment of time2 the planet is slowest at one point on the eccentric and fastest at the opposite point, the answer must therefore be, clearly not.The reason for this is that the two slowings are intermingled, one real and physical, occurring at one place on the eccentric, and the other optical and apparent and not occurring at a single place, but in the place most distant from whatever position is chosen for the observer.Now, when the observer Î± lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric Î² and the center of the equant Î³ on the side of Î² opposite the center of the equant Î³, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position Î¹. But when the observer departs from this line, as at Î´, then a straight line drawn from Î´ through the center of the circle Î² marks the place of the optical slowing, Î·, while the true and physical slowing is at Î¹. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between Î¹ and Î·, as would be if a line were to be drawn from Î´ through Î³ to the point Î¶. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which Î´Î² were the line of apsides of the eccentric and Î²Î³ the line of the equantâs eccentricity, then even though the planetâs true path Î¹Î· remained the same, it would be represented differently at Î´ than at Î±. For to the observer at Î´ the planet would be slowest at Î¶, and to the one at Î± it would be slowest at Î¹. But no such thing would be represented at Î´ that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above.For the forms of the hypotheses differ in that in the former, Î² is the midpoint between Î± and Î³ (as physical considerations require, if the moving power is in Î±), while in the latter the center of the eccentric Î² would not be the midpoint between Î´ and Î³, nor would the line of the equantâs eccentricity pass through the observer Î´, as before.Even if it did pass through Î´, as Î´Î³, it would not cut the eccentric into two equal parts, because it would not cut it at the center Î², and it would not allow the planet to appear on one side fastest and on the other slowest, at opposite places.It is thus established that when a planet's path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged.This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about Î´, and how much this newly established hypothesis at Î´ will be at variance with the appearances as seen at Î±. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from Î³ to the line Î´Î², and Î²Î¼ be made equal to Î²Î³, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at Î· rather than Î¹. This  changes what cannot be changed in the planetâs path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observerâs viewpoint.Even though the planet would traverse the same path Î¹Î· in twenty days (which path appears greater at Î± and smaller at Î´), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between Î¹ and Î·. In particular, for the observer at Î± the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at Î´, you will prevent the planetâs being slowest at Î¹; that is, if you transfer the equant from Î³ to Î¼. For if you draw a straight line through Î³Î¼ to the point Î½ on the circumference and connect Î±Î½, this equation Î±Î½Î¼ alone will be equal to the prior, \n",

       " Î½ the equations about Î¼ will be smaller, and below Î½, greater.For example, at Î· the angle Î¼Î½Î± is much less than Î³Î·Î±.But then what we proposed to do has not been done, for the prior form of hypothesis has not yet been quite established.For Î±Î² is not to Î²Î³ as Î´Î² is to Î²Î¼, since Î²Î¼ is equal to Î²Î³, while Î´Î² is greater than Î±Î².But if, on the other hand, you make Î´Î² be to Î²Î¼ as Î±Î² is to Î²Î³, Î²Î¼ will become greater than Î²Î³.Whence it follows that for the observer at Î±, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity.Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness.It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from Î´ through the center of the eccentric Î². And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point Î³, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere.But what will happen if a new line of apsides be drawn from Î´ through the old equant point Î³, and a new hypothesis of the same form as the old be set up?That is, if the center of the eccentric be transferred from Î² to the line Î´Î³, and Î´Î¸ be made to Î¸Î³ as Î±Î² is to Î²Î³, Î¸ thus being the center of the eccentric?Obviously, the result will be this: the path of the planet in the heavens does not remain entirely the same.About Î¸ let the eccentric ÎµÎºÎ» be described, equal to the previous one, and through Î¸Î² let a straight line be extended to the circumference, on one side to Î¾Î¿ and on the other to ÏÏ.Therefore, Î¾Î¿ and ÏÏ are both of the same magnitude as Î¸Î², and the planet is this much closer to Î² at Î¿, and more remote at Ï, than it would have been had it traversed the previous eccentric.However, the planet is slowest in a different region, for previously the apsis was at Î¹, and now it is at k. Through this mutual tempering it is brought about that the observer previously stationed at Î± has his observations pretty much unchanged, which is the only thing sought for here.But now we shall prove it with numbers belonging to Marsâs motion, although Brahe recorded somewhat different ones.This should prove no impediment to us, since we are only performing a preliminary exercise3 here.Let the magnitudes on the line Î´Î³Î± be taken as follows: let Î´Î± be the quantity of the sunâs eccentricity, \n",

       " should be kept in mind.To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at Î´, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from ÏÎ¸Î¿ to ÏÎ²Î¾, we must proceed as follows.Since Î³ is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line Î³ÎµÎ¹ indicate the same moment in both hypotheses.Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric ÎµÎ¿, it will at that moment be at Îµ with equation Î´ÎµÎ³, but if it is traversing Î¹Î¾, it will be at Î¹ with no equation, since the line of apparent motion Î±Î¹ coincides with the line of mean motion Î³Î¹.Again, after a certain amount of time, whose measure shall be Î¹Î³Î¶ or ÎµÎ³Îº, whose vertical angle is Î´Î³Î±, just found to be 5Â° 27â 47â, let a common moment be taken, represented by Î³ÎºÎ¶.At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric Îµo will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing Î¹Î¾ will be at Î¶ with equation Î³Î¶Î±.Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from Î³, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric.If the observer were at Î³, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at Î¶. But since in the present model the observer is placed at Î´ by the practitioners4 and at Î± by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at Î´. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur.First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around Î¿Î¾ and ÏÏ).Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at Î´ (just as it vanishes at Î¶Îº and the point opposite) according to optical principles.Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below Î¾ and above Ï. Third, it must be close to Î´ (just as it is closer above Ï than below Î¾, because the center of the other eccentric Î² lies off to the right of Î´).If we construct a right angle to point Î³ of the line Î³Î´, this perpendicular from Î³ to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest.Let ÏÏ be drawn through Î³ perpendicular to Î´Î³, intersecting the eccentric about Î¸ at Ï and Ï, and the other at Ï and Ï, and to this let the perpendicular Î²Ï be dropped.Therefore, at the moment Î³Ï the planet will be at Ï and Ï, and at the moment Î³Ï, at Ï and Ï.

       " of the old units.In the next chapter we shall see how much of a difference in Marsâs apparent position this would occasion.Hitherto, we have transposed the observer from Î´ to Î±. Let it now be demonstrated that very nearly the same things happen if the observer remains fixed while the point of the equant is transposed.This we do to make it clear that the same thing can be done in this chapter with an eccentric that has an equant as could be done on a simple eccentric (at the end of Chapter 3 above).In the earlier case, the result was the same whether the observer or the center of the eccentric were transposed, while here, likewise, the result is almost the same whether the observer or the center of the equant be transposed.However, it necessary to adapt this demonstration to this divergence , on account of the great dissimilarity of the opinions followed by the practitioners in demonstrating the second inequality of the planets, which opinions will be keeping us in court in the next chapter.Let the points Î± and Î´ merge into one, so that the observer remain in the same place.Let Î´, Î¸, and Î³ remain the same, but let the line Î³Î²Î± of the previous diagram be deleted, and replaced by ÎÎÎ parallel to it and passing through the point Î´ or Î. Let the segments ÎÎ, ÎÎ be equal to the previous segments Î±Î², Î±Î³.Therefore, ÎÎ³ will be the transposition of the equalizing point Î³, equal to the previous transposition of the observer Î±Î´.Once more, two eccentrics or planetary paths through the aethereal air will be described, about Î and Î¸. All the letters on each circle will be carried over along with them, and the magnitudes of the lines will remain precisely the same.The only difference is that the two points on the two eccentrics at which the planet is to be placed at a given moment are no longer determined by a single line, but by parallel lines drawn from the two equant points Î, Î³, each extended to its own eccentric.For example, when the eccentric Î¸Îº has its planet at Îº, the eccentric ÎÎ will have it at Î, where Î³Îº and ÎÎ are parallel.And when the former has the planet at Îµ, the latter will have it at Î, where Î³Îµ and ÎÎ are again parallel.The rest is clear from the diagram without demonstration.Now, suppose it is not permissible to shift the observer (and it is not permitted by those who make the earth the center of the world, as will be remarked in the next chapter), and that the planet has been observed in several positions on the zodiac, always at opposition to the sun's mean position, and that the practitioner will use the positions and the intervals of time between them to construct this sort of hypothesis, with the observer at Î´, Î´Î¸ the eccentricity of the eccentric Î¸Îº, Î¸Î³ the eccentricity of the equant, and Îº the apogee.Comes now Kepler, who would change the observed positions and times; that is, he would observe the moments and points at which the planet is at opposition to the apparent position of the sun rather  than its mean position.From these positions and times he will have come up with another hypothesis, in which the observer would be left unmoved at Î´ or Î, but where the eccentricity would come out to be ÎÎ in a new eccentric ÎÎ, and the eccentricity ÎÎ of a new equant Î, and there would be a new apogee Î. The question now is whether, if the prior practitioner combines the new eccentric ÎÎ with his original equalizing point Î³, the computed equation and sidereal position of the planet will turn out much different from what he had formerly found using his eccentric Î³Îº.(It is the first inequality that is in question; this discussion is not concerned with the second inequality, and the nature and magnitude of the changes which this procedure would effect therein.)The answer, arising from the equivalence of transpositions, is that the discrepancy will be extremely small.Its maximum, reached in the neighborhood of the points Ï and Î¦, will not exceed five minutes, exactly as before when the observer was transposed, except that now the line ÏÎ¦ is closer to the observer Î´ than is its endpoint Ï. Consequently, the angle ÏÎ´Î¦, which previously was 4â 24â, is now 4â 43â.The opposite happens at ÏÎ¤.It has thus been demonstrated in a Ptolemaic eccentric what sort of disturbances would arise if one should transpose either the observer or the orb and construct a new eccentric, making use of the planetâs oppositions to the sunâs apparent position.I do not think there is any need to repeat the arguments and demonstrate the same equivalence in the Copernican or Tychonic form, which makes use of two epicycles.I shall only show, by what was established at the end of Ch.3, how to delineate both the eccentric-cum-equant that suits the planet, and its transformation into different magnitudes and different positions for the observer, in terms of the Copernican double epicycle.This is done in such a manner that, while the observer is transposed, the path of the planet through the aethereal air is invariant, as nearly as possible, in accord with what has been said in this fifth chapter.(This is exactly the possibility adumbrated in Ch.3).Let the triangle Î´Î³Î± be constructed equal to the previous one, with corresponding lines parallel, and through Î± let Î±Î² be drawn parallel to Î´Î³, and through Î´, Î´Î¸ parallel to Î±Î³.And about centers Î±, Î´ let two concentrics be described, equal to the previous eccentrics Î´Î¸, Î±Î².Let Î´Î³ be extended to Î¶ and Î», and Î±Î³ to Îµ and k, and let Î´Î¶ and Î±Îµ be semidiameters, as before, and lines of apsides (since both go through the same point Î³).Now let Î´Î³ and Î±Î³ be cut at Î· and Î¾ in the same ratio as before, and let Î·Î³ and Î¾Î³ be bisected at Ï and Ï. Then, with radius Î´Ï and upon centers Î¸ and Î¶ let the epicycles Î¹ and Î» be described, and let Î¶Î» be parallel to Î¸Î¹.Then, about centers Î¹ and Î», with radius ÏÎ³, let epicyclets be described through ÏÎ¼ and ÏÏ.Again, let the epicycles Îº and o be described about centers Îµ and Î² with radius Î±Ï, and with Î²Î¿ parallel to ÎµÎº.Next, about centers Îº and o with radius ÏÎ³, let epicyclets be described through ÏÏ and ÏÎ½, and let Î¸Î¹Î¼ and Î²Î¿Î½ be double Î´Î³Î±.Let  the planet on epicyclet ÎºÏ be at Ï nearest Îµ, and the planet on epicyclet Î»Ï be at Î½ nearest Î¶. Therefore, according to the hypothesis deriving from Î´ the planet falls upon ÏÎ¼, while according to the hypothesis deriving from Î± the planet falls upon Î½Ï.Here you see that the points Î¼ and Ï, as well at Ï and Î½, hardly differ when seen from Î´ and Î±, respectively, when the planet is near the apsides.But around the middle intervals these points will be separated from each other only by the amount that separated Ï and Î¦ in the previous diagram.The magnitudes will all be nearly equal and the demonstrations entirely the same.For if Î¸Î¹ and ÎµÎº be extended to meet at Ï, and Î¶Î», Î²Î¿ to meet at Ï, the triangles Î¸ÏÎµ and Î¶ÏÎ² will be congruent to triangle Î´Î³Î±, and corresponding sides will be parallel.These demonstrations will be perplexing enough in themselves, so it is not really advisable to make them more involved by a heaping up of Copernican or Brahean epicycles.Therefore, in what follows, we shall decree that the Copernican or Brahean form count as belonging to the first inequality.For the procedure for treating the hypotheses of the second inequality, since it is always going to concern each of the three, will furnish us with a great abundance of things to do.I now immediately state it as a postulate that whatever we shall demonstrate using the Ptolemaic equant-cum-eccentric also be taken as demonstrated in the Copernican or Brahean concentric-cum-double-epicycle, or eccentrepicycle.For in Ch.4 above, the difference was found to be very small.Chapter 50On six other ways by which an attempt was made to construct the eccentric equations.How small a heap of grain we have gathered from this threshing!But you also see what a huge cloud of husks there is now.They ought to have been hauled back to the beginning of Ch.48, since before I investigated the arcs of the oval path I would have dealt with them.But for the sake of bringing light, it was appropriate to winnow them.Besides, we might end up finding a few useful grains.In the first and second method, the procedure was thisFirst, with eccentricity \n",

and at the same time the trustworthiness of the vicarious hypothesis is explored.While I am thus celebrating a triumph over the motions of Mars, and fetter him in the prison of tables and the leg-irons of eccentric equations, considering him utterly defeated, it is announced in various places that the victory is futile, and war is breaking out again with full force.For while the enemy was in the house as a captive, and hence lightly esteemed, he burst all the chains of the equations and broke out of the prison of the tables.That is, no method administered geometrically under the rule of the opinion of Ch.45 was able to emulate in numerical accuracy the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16 (which has true equations derived from false causes).Outdoors, meanwhile, spies positioned throughout the whole circuit of the eccentricâI mean the true distancesâhave overthrown my troops of physical causes called forth from \n",

And the longitudinal refraction is 2' 39\" or 4' 34\" ^5.Of these two methods of determining the refraction, I shall follow the one which is confirmed by the latitudes, as  follows.In the earlier observation, the observed latitude was 6â North.And because Mars was near the earth, and the angle at the sun was 10Â° 17', while at the earth it was 28Â° 41', this latitude requires an  inclination of 2' 30\".Therefore, in our later observation the inclination will also be 2' 30\", or a little less, since we are 8' closer to the node.But with the inclination assumed to be 2' 30\", since here the angle at the sun is 61Â°, and at earth 38Â°, a latitude of about 1' 50\" N. must follow, as indicated by our parallactic table ^6.But by using the refraction of the fixed stars, we were left with a latitude of 3' 29\" N., while by using the solar refraction we were moved down to 0Â° 33' S. Thus in the second our refraction was greater than would be correct, and in the first, less.So the correct refraction is between the two, namely, 3' 36\".That is, for us Mars will be put at 8Â° 46ââ Sagittarius.Let O be the sun, B and A points on the earthâs orbit, A the position of the earth in the earlier observation, B in the later, M Mars.Let the lines be connected.And although Mars does not return to exactly the same place, let it nonetheless be represented in both instances by the line OM.Thus MAO is 28Â° 41' 14\", and AO is 101,365.Let MO, the distance of Mars from the sun (which is being sought here), be taken as if known, and let it be 154,200.Thus OM will fall at 15Â° 31' 3\" Scorpio.And if OM is assumed to be \n",

       " at an anomaly of 161Â° 45Â½', an admirable consensus much to be suspected.For they can hardly all be so certain and neat.Furthermore, both distances must be increased somewhat owing to the inclination of this position on the eccentric, which is at a maximum.So, from this long induction, using a great many positions on the eccentric, it is clear that those distances of Mars from the sun are mutually equal whose points on the orbit are equally remote from aphelion, a question which we have investigated in Ch.16 and 42.This is an evident way of showing that the aphelion we have obtained is correct, by Euclid III.7.At the same time, the distances of the sun from earth are confirmed, which were derived in Ch.29 above and employed here in various ways.Nor is there any great discrepancy in the numbers that could testify to any flaw in them.The implications of the observations presented in this chapter, and of the distances found through them, for the shaping of the planetary path, for which purpose we have produced them in this chapter, we shall postpone until Chapter 55.First, there is something that must be proved in Ch.52 following, and in Ch.53 many more observations are going to be called upon to testify.Chapter 52Demonstration from the observations of Chapter 51 that the planetâs eccentric is set up, not about the center of the sunâs epicycle, or the point of the sunâs mean position, but about the actual body of the sun; and that the line of apsides goes through the latter rather than the former.It is a happy accident that the distances found in Chapter 51 also inform us about this, which, though promised in Chapters 6, 26, and 33,I deliberately postponed until this point.For if I was correct in constructing the eccentric of Mars about the body of the sun, it is necessary that the planet really be at its greatest distance from the sun in the parts around 29Â°Leo, and that those parts which are atequal intervals from 29Â° Leo in either semicircle be at equal distances from the sun, and at unequal distances from the point that stands for the sun, which for Brahe is the center of the sun's epicycle.More specifically, the distances should be less in the descending semicircle.When this is proved, it will follow in addition that the parts around 24Â° Leo are neither the most distant from the sun's body, nor from the Copernican center of the world, which for Brahe is the center of the sun's epicycle, and also the center to which the planetary circle is attached; and the parts at an equal arc's removal from 24Â° Leo in either semicircle are at unequal distances from the sun and from the point that stands for it.For let there be set out the sun's center A, Mars's line of apsides AC, eccentricity AC, and the eccentric ED with center C, and let the point F above AC be the point of uniform motion, G the aphelion, GFE and GFD equal angles, and let EA, DA be connected, which will be equal, as has now been proven.And through A let the line AB be drawn towards Capricorn, and let AB be extended from A towards Capricorn until its length be \n",

       " or even more, who could not tolerate observations with a mere 200 units' error?Hence, regions on opposite semicircles of the eccentric that are equidistant from G, such as E and D, are not equidistant from any points not at the center other than those on the line CA that goes through the body of the sun ^1.You may reply, however, that if BC is connected and extended, a new apsis is created where that line intersects the circle, and the point D is closer to that apsis than is the point E. So is it any wonder that BD is also longer?I answer that whatever lines are drawn, AE and AD always stay the same, since they are proven from the observations, in all three forms of hypotheses, and thus absolutely nothing in this derivation was assumed that could be subject to controversy.And so, with AE and AD remaining the same, let BC be drawn exactly as is objected against me.Nevertheless, that line BC by no means gives rise to a hypothesis that will fit the acronychal2 observations, as I proved in Chapter 6.Instead, to save the acronychal positions, one needs to substitute for BC a line FH through F parallel to CB, passing through F and H, the centers of uniform motion for Mars and the sun.But when this is done, the center of the eccentric is at the same time transferred from C to I, and there is more than a semicircle on the side of E, and less on the side of D. Nor are AE and AD left unchanged, but AE is lengthened, and AD is shortened.And since these lines are altered, the observations at positions other than acronychal will never be saved, since they give evidence that AE and AD are equal.I don't think there is any need for computation.Nevertheless, if there is anyone who enjoys this labor (even though no astronomer should try anything with numbers whose foundations he has not previously seen in geometry, and geometry has just overturned the foundations of such an undertaking), he has an example of it in Ch.24 above.There, I computed the distances of earth from H, the point of uniformity of the earth's motion, and the distance of Mars from the same point H, simultaneously in a single operation, using the same observations by which I afterwards computed the distances of earth and Mars from the center of the sun A, in Ch.26.For the peculiar cleverness of the method I have used is this: that it shows that whatever point in the plane of the earth's circle is chosen that has, with respect to the sun's body, a position described and determined through a number of observations both in zodiacal longitude and in distance from the sun, also shows the distance of earth and Mars from that chosen point; and it does these things without any knowledge of the equated anomaly on the eccentric corresponding to that point.In fact, the only reason why I used that knowledge in Chapter 26 was that it is a short cut ^3.But in addition, there is another way to argue the point.It was proved in Chapter 44 above that the planet's orbit is not a circle but an oval, such that the diameter on it which is called the [line] of apsides is the longest.Just now, in \n",

       " it was proved that regions that are equally removed from the point of the aphelion G also make an equal incursion at the sides.There is thus a real oval situated about the line AC, and therefore, it is not situated about the line FH.And one who would compute the various distances of Mars from the point H by the method just recommended will find a great irregularity in the distances, incapable of being included by any means in a circle or in any other possible figure set up about FH.So again the faith that was pledged in Chapter 6 and in many other places in this work, I have redeemed from all tincture of circular reasoning, and have shown that the eccentric of Mars cannot be referred to anything but the sun itself; and that, in consequence, it is not only reason that stands with me, but the observations themselves, in my releasing the observations of Mars from the sun's mean motion and measuring them out by the apparent motion of the sun.Chapter 53Another method of exploring the distances of Mars from the sun, using severed contiguous observations before and after acronychal position: wherein the eccentric positions are also explored at the same time.Since we are establishing new hypotheses here, in that we are enquiring into the natural cause of the eccentric equations, it is appropriate that we should explore everything as carefully as possible, lest in neglecting the foundations we build upon them a building doomed to ruin.And so it furthers us to  explore this same thing (perfectly accurate distances of Mars from the sun) by many methods.Let Î± be the sun, Î² the position of earth before opposition of Mars to the sun, and Î±Î²Î´ the angle of vision, or the arc of the elongation of Î´ from the sun.Likewise, let Î³ be the position of the earth after opposition, and Î±Î³Î´ the angle of vision.Thus, at the first time, let the planet be on the line Î²Î´, and at the second, on the line Î³Î´, and let it actually traverse Î¸Î·.So, when the time of the two observations is given, the angle Î¸Î±Î· will be given precisely enough by the vicarious hypothesis, for whatever eccentric position.If the pair of times are not far from each other, or if the planet is near the apsides or the middle elongations, the difference in length of the lines Î±Î¸, Î±Î· will also be known tolerably ^1.And we have included this much among our presuppositions only in order that there be no remaining difficulty here.And so, in dealing with the angles Î¸Î²Î±, Î·Î³Î±, given by observation, and Î²Î±, Î³Î±, which are known from Part III, if we were to assume [a value for] Î¸Î±, and consequently also Î·Î±, it is obvious that if this assumed value were longer than it should be, such as ÎºÎ±, Î¹Î±, then the angle Î¹Î±Îº would come out less than it should be; and if, on the other hand, it were shorter than it should be, such as Î¶Î±, ÎµÎ±, the angle ÎµÎ±Î¶ would come out greater than it should be.So we must assume such distances as will make the angle of motion on the eccentric come out right.Any possible remaining error in the eccentric position will also occur in the same way.For let it be that Î¸Î±, Î·Î± are in their correct positions, and from that point let Î¸Î± be carried forward, in error, through the angle Î¸Î±Î´.And let Î·Î± likewise be carried forward, through the equal angle Î·Î±Îµ.You see that Î±Î´, substituted for Î±Î¸, is going to be very much too long, and Î±Îµ, following Î±Î·, will be quite short, contrary to what, by hypothesis, is known at the start.Furthermore, the angle Î³Î±Î² ought not to be as small as possible, so that no error of observation, or at least no minimal one, in opposite directions in the sky (as can happen) could have any great effect.Now, with the help of this method, we must go through the years 1582 in Cancer, 1585 in Leo, 1587 in Virgo, 1589 in Scorpio, 1591 in Sagittarius, 1593 in Pisces, and 1595 in Taurus.For sufficient observations are at hand in all places.If it seems a good idea to investigate demonstratively the elongation of the earth from the line through the sun and the planet at which any error in the distance of Mars from the sun would be most evidently perceived, let Ch.6 be consulted.For, following that chapter, we shall define it as that angle at the sun whose sine has to the radius about the same ratio as the excess of Mars's distance from the sun over the sine of the complement of the angle has to the distance itself.For let Î± be the sun, Î¸ the planet, Î½Î¾ the earth's orb.From Î¸ let the straight line Î¸Î¼ be drawn perpendicular to Î¸Î±.And on Î¸Î¼ let a number of centers be chosen, about which let circles through Î¸ be described, until one of them be tangent to the earth's orb at Î½ ^2.The point Î½ will be where the defect of Î±Î¸ at Î¸ appears most evidently, that is, where it subtends the greatest angle.3 From Î½ let Î½Î¿ be drawn parallel to Î¼Î¸, intersecting Î±Î¸ at Î¿. I say that Î¿Î½ is to Î½Î± as Î¿Î¸ is to Î¸Î±.For as Î½Î¼, or (which is the same thing) Î¸Î¼, is to Î¼Î±, so is Î¿Î½ to Î½Î±.But Î½Î¼ is to Î¼Î± as Î¿Î¸, and (very nearly) Î¾Î¸, is to Î¸Î± ^4.Therefore, etc.Let Î±Î¸ be 161,000.Thus Î¾Î¸ will be nearly 61,000.And as 161 is to 61, so is \n",

       " over the radius 100,000.Therefore, if the radius is substituted for the secant at the middle elongation, this accomplishes what the observations suggest.And, in the diagram in Chapter 40,1 have concluded generally that if you use HR instead of HA, VR instead of VA, and substitute EB for EA, and so on for all of them, the effect on the rest of the eccentric positions will be the same as what was done here at the middle elongations.And by equivalence, in the small diagram of Chapter 39, Î±Îº will be taken instead of the lines Î±Î´ or Î±Î¹, and Î±Î¼ for Î±Îµ or Î±Î».And so the reader should peruse Chapter 39 again.He will find that what the observations additionally testify here was already urged there, from natural causes, namely, that it appears reasonable that the planet perform some sort of reciprocation, moving on the diameter, as if of an epicycle, that is always directed towards the sun.He will also find that there is nothing more at odds with this notion than this: that when we proposed to represent a perfect circle, we were forced to make the highest parts Î³Î¹ of the reciprocation unequal to the lowest Î»Î¶, which parts correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the highest being short, and the lowest long.So, now that the planet's circular path is denied, and ÎºÎ±, Î¼Î± are taken instead of Î´Î±, ÎµÎ±, that is, instead of Î¹Î±, Î»Î±, as was said, it follows further that those parts of the reciprocation, such as Î³Îº, Î¼Î¶, are equal.And that which had tormented us for a long time in Chapter 39 now surrenders to us in the face of the proof of the truth we have perceived.As for the middle parts ÎºÎ¼ still being larger than the extremes Î³Îº, Î¼Î¶, it willbe said in Chapter 57 following that this is in accord with nature, contrary to what we had been able to understand in Chapter 39.But in addition, the difficulty that arose in Chapter 39 through supposing that the increase of the sun's [apparent] diameter serve the planet as an index for its approaching and receding, now vanishes entirely, as will appear in Chapter 57.Thus, concerning the eccentric anomaly of 90Â°, I easily was able to see in the manner just mentioned, that instead of the distance EA of the perfect circle, EB is to be taken, corresponding to an equated anomaly EAB.And although I have drawn a general conclusion concerning all the anomalies using a single one as an example, this was not a consequence just of that one anomaly: there was need to strengthen it using closely spaced observations.So now you understand the special capacity in which the observations of Chapters 51 and 53 are appointed to serve us, namely, to give this evidence.Come, then: let the eccentric anomalies CBG, CBH be computed at the equated anomalies set out in those chapters, that is, at the angles CAG, CAH, and so on.Nor is there any need to strive after minute parts, nor be concerned about the imperfection of the eccentric equations that still remain in Ch.19, 29, 43, 47, 48, 49, and 50.Use any of these methods, particularly the one in Ch.43.You will not err in the equations by more than eight minutes.When the angles are set up, seek out the lines, HR corresponding to the equated angle HAC, RV corresponding to the equated VAC, and so on for the others, and transpose them to the dimension of the orbs found in Ch.54.You will find them as in the following table.From the observations of Ch.51On the descendingsemicircleComputed from the reciprocation162,994163,051158,091158,111148,000148,050In the observations of Chapter 53, there is no need to do the same thing.For I previously used this same method of reciprocation to find out the distances of Mars from the sun which I called upon in order to compute Mars's apparent positions.And since the observations were represented by these, they will therefore be correct ^2.As you see, therefore, the distances measured on the diameter, found a priori in Ch.39, are confirmed by closely spaced and very reliable observations throughout the entire perimeter of the eccentric.Chapter 57By what natural principles the planet may be made to reciprocate as if on the diameter of an epicycle.It is clear, then, from the most reliable observations, that the course of the planet through the aethereal air is not a circle, but an oval figure, and that it reciprocates on the diameter of a small circle in the following manner.Suppose that, after describing equal arcs on the eccentric, the planet comes to be  at the diametral distances Î³Î±, ÎºÎ±, Î¼Î±, Î¶Î±, instead of the circumferential distances Î³Î±, Î´Î±, ÎµÎ±, Î¶Î± (that is, Î³Î±, Î¹Î±, Î»Î±, Î¶Î±), upon which the perfect circle lies.It is clear from inspection that a lunule is cut off from the perfect semicircle of the eccentric, whose breadth at any point is equal to the differences between the two diverse distances, such as Î¹Îº, Î»Î¼.This is proposed not on the basis of arguments a priori, but of observations, as I have just said; so now the physical theories will proceed more correctly than they had hitherto.***  For it is not by any ratiocinative or mental process that a planetary mind assigns the equal parts of the reciprocation Î³Îº, ÎºÎ¼, Î¼Î¶, to equal arcs CD, DE, EF, of the as yet untraversed eccentric, for the former are not equal.Instead, the reciprocation is coordinated with the space traversed on the eccentric in a natural way, which depends not upon the equality of the angles DBC, EBD, FBE, but upon the strength**1  of the ever increasing angle DBC, EBC, FBC, which strength approximates the sine (so called by the geometers).The ascentâs being changed into descent thereby gradually, by a continuous diminution, is more probably than if the planet were said suddenly to turn its prow in the other direction â which we indeed said in Ch.39 clearly conflicts with observational results.And since the measure of this reciprocation points the finger at a natural mode, its cause will also be natural; that is, it will be some natural â or better, corporeal â faculty, and not a planetary mind.Also in Ch.39, for the best reasons, one of our suppositions was that a planet cannot make a transition from place to place by the bare effort of its  inherent forces unless these be assisted or directed by an extrinsic force.This being the case, we must consider whether we should also carry over this reciprocation in part to the solar power itself.In our exertions to this end, we shall  be obliged once again to take up our oars which were introduced in Ch.39 ^2.Let there be a circular river CDE, FGH, and in it a sailor who revolves his oar once in twice the periodic time of the planet, by an inherent and perfectly uniform force.Thus at C let the line of the oar be at right angles to the line from the sun, and let it direct now the bow and now the stern forward at alternate returns.At F, however, let the line of the oar be part of the line from the sun, and at other positions let it have an intermediate inclination.Now the stream, flowing down upon the oar at DE, will push the ship3 down towards A, while from C it will push very little, since the ship is also but slightly inclined.The same is true at F, because at this moment the stream strikes the oar directly.At D and E, however, it pushes down more strongly, because here the oar is greatly disposed to such an approach by its inclination.The opposite happens in the ascending semicircle.For the river, coming beneath the oar at G and H, drives it away from the sun.At the same time it will also happen, other things being equal, that the impulse is less at C than at F, since our river is weak at C and strong at F.And this is is also in accordance with our wishes, since our reciprocation was following equal spaces on the eccentric, and the planet spends longer in the upper ones than in the lower.This example shows only the possibility of this arrangement.In itself it  is rather inadequate, since the rotations of the oar and the river are accomplished, not in the same time, but a double time.Furthermore, to those looking at them from earth, the faces of the planets should appear to change, while the face of the moon, although it participates with the planets in that motion which we are discussing, does not change over the course of a month.Instead, it always is turned towards the earth, whence its eccentricity is reckoned.In addition, while the force of a river is material (for its water acts by its weight and material impetus), the force of the sun is immaterial.Therefore, the comparison with the planets ought to be different: they will need no oar, no physical instrument, for catching hold of the force of some weighty thing (for that motive species of the sun has no weight).Nor do we deem it fitting that the stars have a corporeal oar, seeing that we hold them to be round.But from this very refutation, there comes another example, which will perhaps be more suitable.The river and the oar are of the same quality.The river is an immaterial species of magnetic power in the sun.So why not have the oar too borrow something from the magnet?What if all the bodies of the planets are enormous round magnets?Of the earth (one of the planets, for  Copernicus) there is no doubt.William Gilbert has proved it.But to describe this power more plainly, the planetâs globe has two poles, of which one will seek out the sun, and the other will flee the  sun.So let us imagine an axis of this sort as a magnetic strip, and let its point seek the sun.But despite its sunseeking magnetic nature, let it remain ever parallel to itself in the translational motion of the globe, except to the extent that over the ages it transfers the polar inclination from one of the fixed  stars to another, thus causing the progressive motion of the aphelion.I nevertheless admit the possibility that a mind may be needed for both of these, of such a nature as to be adequately instructed by the animate faculty for performing this motion.For this is a motion, not of the entire body from place to place (which motion, in Ch.39 above, was rightly denied to a motive cause inherent in the planets),4 but of the parts about the center of the whole, as if at rest.Here again, in the globe of the earth there is an example of this directional property of the axis, from Copernicus.For as long as the axis of the earth, in the annual circulation of its center, remains almost perfectly equidistant from  itself in all its positions, summer and winter are brought about.* On the other hand, insofar as very long ages cause it to incline, the fixed stars are thought to move forward, and the equinoxes to retrogress.Why, then, should we have doubts about attributing to all the planets, in order to save the phenomena of eccentricity, something that is observed to be in one of them (that is, the earth) because of the phenomena of the precession of the equinoxes and the sun's annual cycle of rising and falling?Copernicus, for example, was deceived here when he thought that he needed a special principle to cause the earth to reciprocate annually from north to south and back so as to produce summer and winter, and to bring about the equality of the tropical and sidereal years (to the extent that they are equal) by constructing it in a manner commensurate with its revolution.For all those effects are obtained by having the earthâs axis, about which the diurnal motion is made, retain a single, constant direction: there is no need for extrinsic causes, except to account only for the extremely slow precession of the equinoxes.And so here, too, there is on no account any need for movers for the planet, which would carry its body about the sun in a parallel position, and at the same time perform the reciprocation.For the one will naturally depend upon the other.The only thing remaining to be considered is the extremely slow progression of the aphelia.To continue: when the strip is at C and F, there is no reason why the planet  should approach or recede, since it holds its ends at equal distances from the sun, and would undoubtedly turn its point towards the sun if it were allowed to do so by the force that holds its axis straight and parallel.When the planet moves away from C, the point approaches the sun perceptibly, and the tail end recedes.Therefore, the globe begins perceptibly to navigate towards the sun.After F, the tail end perceptibly approaches, and the head end recedes from the sun.Therefore, by a natural aversion, the whole globe perceptibly flees the sun.And when it is opposite A, where the length of the axis is pointed directly at the sun, its approach in the former situation, or its flight in the latter, is strongest.Furthermore, our earlier presuppositions derived from the observations postulated this.For there, of the parts of the reciprocation Î³Îº, ÎºÎ¼, Î¼Î¶ which correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the parts at the middle, such as ÎºÎ¼, were longest, and those near Î³ and Î¶ were short.But it is also consistent that the observations would have Î³Îº, Î¼Î¶ equal, although their arcs Î³Î´, ÎµÎ¶, or better, CD, EF on the eccentric, though equal, are traversed in unequal times, longer for CD, so that the part of the reciprocation Î³Îº is traversed in a longer time than Î¼Î¶ which is equal to it.For similarly, magnets approach one another more slowly when they are at a greater interval, and more swiftly and more quickly at a shorter interval.In fact, we can transfer that force which keeps the  magnetic axis in a parallel position, and does not allow it to remain pointed  towards the sun, from the attention of a mind, to which we had entrusted it a little earlier, to the functions of nature.It appears to be an objection to this, that nature always acts in one and the same way, while this retentive force appears to make its exertions differently at different times.This is seen, for  example, in the tendency of the axis to incline towards the sun, for the impeding of which the retentive force is ordained, which tendency is evanescent at the middle elongations but most strongly evident at aphelion and perihelion.Nevertheless, what is there to prevent this force of retention's being in many places stronger than the tendency to incline towards the sun, so that the force is either not at all or but little wearied by such a weak adversary?Let us again  take an example from the magnet.In it are manifestly mingled two powers, one of directing it towards the pole, and the other of seeking iron.Thus if a strip or nautical needle be directed towards the pole, while some iron approach from the side, the needle quickly declines from the pole and inclines towards the iron, thus indulging somewhat in its intimacy with the iron, but in such a way that it gives most of it to the pole.Indeed, Gilbert thinks this  to be the reason why a strip declines from the pole towards the continents of greatest magnitude, the cause of this declination thus lying in the tracts of land, being greater and having a more vigorous power in the vicinity to the extent that they are higher on the right or left.Therefore, we can ascribe the same tasks and a uniform action to both  natural faculties, and by the interplay of the two we can show a cause for the translation of the aphelia which will be neither obscure, nor, by Hercules, imaginary.For suppose that this force of directing the axis towards the sun does detract somewhat from the retentive power, commensurate with the ratio of the two.Accordingly, in the aphelial semicircle, as at C, the point will gradually incline towards H (that is, backward), and the tail end will turn away from the sun, gradually overcoming the retentive force.Thus the aphelion will become retrograde.But in the perihelial semicircle, as at F, the same point will incline towards G (that is, forward), again overcoming the contrary retentive force.Thus the aphelion will then be made to move forward, and to be fast.But because AF is shorter than AC, and the sun is closer to F than to C, the force tending to turn the magnetic axis towards the sun is therefore stronger at F than at C. Thus more will be detracted from the retentive [force] at F than at C. So the perihelial forward inclination not only compensates for  the aphelial backward inclination, but even overcomes it.And so the reason is clear why the apsides progress, and do not retrogress.Thus the aphelion we have found will have that value only at an equated anomaly of 90Â° and 270Â° when the axis of power is directed straight at the sun, which is its correct place.And the motion of the aphelion will be spiral, as will become clear below in Chapter 68 for the motion of precession of the equinoxes also, which exists through another cause.So the direction of the magnetic axis in its parallel position, or the force which is its custodian, will not respect one or another of the fixed stars, but only the position of its body, as it is at any particular time.And, to think the matter through simply: because this direction is more like rest than motion, it is more appropriately sought in the material, and in the disposition of the body, than in some mind.But come: let us track more closely this similarity of the planetary  reciprocation to the motion of a magnet, and that by a most beautiful geometrical demonstration, so that it may be clear that magnets have such a motion as that which we perceive in the planet.Let DFA be either a round magnet or the body of Mars, DA the line along which the magnetic power is oriented, D the pole that seeks the sun, A the pole that flees the sun.You will note, first, that in this theory it is all the same whether we consider the entire globe of the magnetic body, or one single physical line of its power, parallel to DA.For this magnetic power is corporeal, and divisible with the body, as the  Englishman Gilbert, B. Porta, and others, have proved,5 surely because its globe consists of an infinite number of physical lines, as it were, parallel to DA, whose power is extended in a straight line and in one direction in the world.Therefore, the judgements made about individual parts with respect to the quality of their motion will be the same as those concerning them all joined together, and vice versa.So let the central axis DA be proposed for theorizing, in place of the whole body and all its filaments.Let DA be bisected at B, and let FBI be drawn perpendicular to DA.Thus, when the planet is so positioned that BI points toward the center of the sun, there will be no [tendency to] approach.For the angles DBI, ABI are equal, and thus have equal strength, the former for approaching, and the latter for receding.So this is like an equipoise in mechanics ^6.Under these conditions, the center of Mars B is on the apsides, at aphelion, say, at its greatest distance from the sun.Now let some arc IC be taken, measuring the angle of equated anomaly, and let BC be drawn and extended to K. And let the planet be so situated that BC points towards the sun, which is understood to be indicated by K. The first  thing to be sought is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach.Now the approach occurs because the seeking pole D is inclined towards the sun K at the angle DBK, while the fleeing pole A is turned away at the angle ABK.And since the strength of this angle is natural, it will follow the same ratio as the balance.But  when a line CP is drawn from C perpendicular to DA, between DP and PA there will be the ratio of the balance.For if a pair of scales is suspended from the balance support KB, and the arms come to rest at the angle DBK, the weight of the arm BD will be to the weight of the arm BA as DP is to PA, just as, if the balance arms were suspended from CP at P, and the weight of the arm BA were applied to PD while the weight of BD were applied to PA, then DA would be at right angles to the hanging balance support CP.See my Optics,7 and do not be easily swayed by insufficiently  careful experimentation.Therefore, as DP is to PA, so is the strength of angle ABC to the strength of angle DBC.Thus DP here measures the force of fleeing, and PA the seeking force.From PA subtract a magnitude equal to DP, and let this be AS.Therefore, SP is the measure of the seeking power alone, with the impediment of fleeing [power] subtracted, and it will be in the same proportion in which AD measures the single greatest force.But where the half DB measures the greatest force, the half of PS, which is PB, or the sine CN of the equated anomaly CBI, measures the net force of the planet's approach towards the sun at this location.So the sine of the equated anomaly is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach towards the sun in this place.And this is the measure of the increments of power.The measure of the distance of the reciprocation traversed by these continuous increments of power is quite another thing.For the observations show that if the eccentric anomaly GI corresponds to the equated anomaly IC, the versed sine IH of the arc GI is the measure of the reciprocation accomplished.If this can also be deduced from the previously indicated measure of the speed CN, then we shall have reconciled experience with the demonstration involving the balance.Since the sine of any arc is the measure of the strength of that angle, the sum of the sines will be an approximate measure of the sum of the strengths or impressions over all the equal parts of the circle.And the completion of the entire reciprocation is the effect of all of these in common.Furthermore, letting IC and IG,  though they are unequal elsewhere, be equal here to avoid confusion, the sum of the sines of the arc IG is to the sum of the sines over the quadrant, approximately as the versed sine IH of that arc IG is to the versed sine IB of the quadrant.Approximately, I say.For at the beginning, when both the versed sine and its increments are small, it is less by half than the sum of the sines.For: Let the quadrant be taken as 90 units.The sum of the 90 sines is \n",

       " ^12.It has been demonstrated that if any magnet be set out as we have  supposed the bodies of the planets to be set out in the heavens with respect to the sun, a reciprocation of the magnetic body will result that is such as is measured by the versed sine, as regards the space traversed.And indeed, the observations testify that the planet's body reciprocates according to the measure of the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly.It is therefore perfectly consistent that the bodies of the planets be magnetic, and so disposed to the sun as we have described.I must now show that it was not a great mistake to have taken the arcs IC  and IG as equal.When I say that the arc IC on the body of the planet is the measure  of the equated anomaly, I am speaking properly, and CN is then the genuine measure of the strength possessed by the planet when it has the sun on the line BK.However, when I say that IG is the measure of the eccentric anomaly which corresponds to the [equated] anomaly IC, I am speaking improperly, incorrectly using the circle of the planet's body to represent the eccentric.But on the eccentric's descending semicircle, since a greater arc of eccentric anomaly corresponds to  a smaller arc of equated anomaly (namely, IG to IC), we will be adding up considerably more sines on IG than on IC, and rightly so.For since the sine measures the strength, and the strength acts in proportion to the time and to the closeness to the sun (magnets being stronger when closer)âthat is, to put it briefly, in proportion to the arc IGâjust as many sines should be set up on IC as are found on IG.Our only error is this, that we take those many sines to be longer than they should be, as GH is longer than CN.But first of all this excess is in itself very small and imperceptible.For at the beginning of the quadrant the arcs IC and IG hardly differ, and the sines are small, and at the end of the quadrant, where the eccentric equation CG is greatest, the sines hardly differ.And then this error is in accord with our wishes.For the sums of the sines  always come out a little greater than the versed sines; and here we are keen to accommodate and reconcile the libratory and magnetic ratios to those commended by experience.Therefore, this present error of ours, of accumulating long sines instead of short ones, is avoided if we use the versed sines instead of the sums of the sines themselves, for the sums of the sines are not exactly equal to the versed sines, but exceed them because of the effect of the reciprocation.Therefore, by the best reasoning at our disposal, we have brought the calculation within the limits of observable error ^13.Let us conclude that the body of the planet, like a magnet, approaches and recedes according to the law of the lever along an imaginary diameter of the epicycle tending towards the sun, and that the body's diameter of power, its true diameter DA, tends towards the middle elongations, so that for this time BD tends toward 29Â° Taurus BA towards 29Â° Scorpio.Thus this reciprocational approach is performed without the action of mind, by a magnetic force which, though it inheres in the planet and is independent, nevertheless depends for its definition upon the extrinsic body of the sun.For the force is defined as seeking the sun or fleeing it.And while the force between magnets tending to bring them together ought to be mutual, I have denied, in Chapter 39 above, that the sun has the planets' attracting force: it was instead understood to be purely attractive only, as is clear from the argument presented there ^14.The planets' force, on the other hand, is supposed to be simultaneously attractive on one side and repulsive on the other.Alternatively, one might suppose that the sun, like unmagnetized iron, is only sought after, and does not in turn seek other things.For in the above passage, its filaments were circular, while those of the planets are here supposed to be straight.I am satisfied if this magnetic example demonstrates the general possibility of the proposed mechanism.Concerning its details, however, I have doubts.For when the earth is in question, it is certain that its axis, whose constant  and parallel direction brings about the year's seasons at the cardinal points, is not well suited to bringing about this reciprocation or this aphelion.The sun's apogee, or earth's aphelion, today closely coincides with the solstitial points, and not with the equinoctial, which would fit our theory; nor will it have remained at a constant distance from the cardinal points.And if this axis is unsuitable, it seems that there is none suitable in the earth's entire body, since there is no part of it which rests in the same position while the whole body of the globe revolves in a ceaseless daily whirl about that axis.So indeed, there may be absolutely no material, magnetic faculty that can accomplish the tasks entrusted to the planets individually, since there may be a lack of means, that is, no suitable diameter of the body which remains equidistant to itself as the body is moved around.For this lack has just been made apparent in one of the planets, namely, the globe of the earth.Therefore, let a mind be summoned, which, as was said in Chapter 39, arrives at a knowledge of the distances it traverses by contemplating the growth of the sun's diameter ^15.Let this mind govern a faculty, either animate or natural, that keeps its globe in a parallel position in a manner allowing it to be suitably impelled by the solar power and to reciprocate with respect to the sun.(For a mere mind, unassisted by a faculty of a lower order, could not by itself do anything in a body.16) At the same time care should be taken that the periodic time of the reciprocation not be made exactly equal to the periodic return of the planet, so that the apsides will move.The plausibility of these things is argued in Chapter 39 above ^17.Now that we have obtained from the observations the laws and quantitative characteristics of this reciprocation by which the sun's apparent diameter is varied, matters of which we were still ignorant in Ch.39, it remains for us to see whether those laws may be such that the planets may plausibly know them.The laws of the reciprocation were that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly is the measure of the part of the reciprocation completed.To begin, therefore, I say that admitting as given  the observational evidence, namely, that after equal arcs of the eccentric are traversed, the planet is found at Î³, Îº, Î¼, Î¶ rather than at Î³, Î¹, Î», Î¶, the increment of the sun's diameter presents a legitimate measure of the versed sine of the equated anomaly,18 no less so than we know the versed sines of the eccentric anomaly to be a measure of the reciprocation.Now, as was said in Ch.39,19 the planet's mind (if it has such an adjunct) perceives the spaces it traverses in the reciprocation in no other way than by the evidence provided by the increase of the sun's diameter.It will therefore be fitting that it know the versed sine of the equated anomaly, in order that by approaching it might increase the sun's diameter to its prescribed size.The proof is as follows.Let the planet be at Î³, Îº, Î¼, Î¶ after traversing equal arc of the imperfect eccentric CD, DE, EF, and let the points D and H be joined, the line intersecting the diameter CF at I. Therefore, since the straight lines Î´ÎºÎ¸, ÎµÎ¼Î· cut the {marginal:277} epicycle into arcs similar to those on the eccentric, by construction, as CF is to CI, so will Î³Î¶ be to Î³Îº, one section being a measure of the other.These things being so, I say it will also follow that the diameters of the sun at Î±, as observed from Î³, Îº, Î¼, Î¶, will be augmented by the same measure, namely, the measure by which the versed sine of the equated anomaly increases.It would be inconvenient to prove this solidly here.It will, however, easily be understood as holding solidly if we prove it for both ends and the middle.At C the equated anomaly is nothing, and the versed sine is nothing, and the sun, observed from Î³, appears at its minimum, so that the amount of its increase is again nothing.At F the equated anomaly is 180Â°.The versed sine is equal to the whole diameter, 200,000.And the sun, observed from Î¶, appears at its maximum, so that it shall have acquired all of its increase.Now for an equated anomaly of 90Â°, from A let AM be set up perpendicular to CF, and let MB be joined.Also, from Î± let a line be drawn tangent to the epicycle at Î½, and the tangent point Î½ be joined with the center Î². Now since Î±Î½Î² is right, by Euclid III.18, and MAB is right by construction, and Î²Î½, BA are equal by construction, as well as Î²Î±, BM, therefore, the triangles are equal and congruent.So Î½Î²Î±, ABM are equal.From Î½ let Î½Î¿ be drawn perpendicular to Î³Î¶.Therefore, since Î½Î¿Î² is right, it is equal to MAB, and Î½Î²Î¿ will be equal to MBA.So the triangles are similar, and as Î½Î² is to Î²Î¿, so is MB to BA, and vice versa.And since Î½Î², Î²Î³, and Î²Î¶ are equal, and also MB, BC, and BF, as Î½Î², Î²Î¿ together, or Î³Î¿, is to Î¿Î¶, so are MB, BA together, or CA, to AF.Therefore, since CA is the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly CBM, and is supposed to be the measure of the corresponding part of the reciprocation, Î³Î¿ will be that part.Therefore, at this eccentric anomaly CBM, or equated anomaly CAM of 90Â°, the planet will be at Î¿.But the versed sine of the equated anomaly of 90Â°, the angle CAM, is half the total diameter, or 100,000.I say also that the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the sun at A, Î±, as seen from Î¿, will be a mean between the magnitudes as seen from Î³ and Î¶, so that it shall have acquired half of its increase when the planet is at Î¿ belowÎ².For let the diameter of the sun's body be Î±Î¾, and the apparent angles formed by joining Î¾ with Î¶, Î¿, Î³, be Î¾Î¶Î±, Î¾Î¿Î±, Î¾Î³Î±.And because AF, Î¶Î± are equal, as well as AC, Î±Î³, and as CA is to AF, so is Î³Î¿ to Î¿Î¶, therefore, as Î³Î± is to Î±Î¶ so is Î³Î¿ to Î¿Î¶.But Î³Î¾ differs imperceptibly from Î³Î±, and Î¶Î¾ from Î¶Î±.Therefore, as Î³Î¾ is to Î¶Î¾, so is Î³Î¿ to Î¿Î¶, within the limits of perception.So in the triangle Î³Î¾Î¶, the angle Î¾ is divided by the line Î¾Î¿ so that the base Î³Î¶ is divided in the same ratio as the sides Î³Î¾, Î¶Î¾.Therefore, by the converse of Euclid VI.3, the angle Î³Î¾Î¶ is divided into two equal parts by the line Î¾Î¿, and Î³Î¾Î¿ is half of Î³Î¾Î¶, the total increase of the sun's diameter.Q. E. D. It is therefore certain at both ends and the middle that in this way, if the diameter of the reciprocation is divided by the planet in proportion to the versed sines of the eccentic anomaly, the sun's diameter would increase in  proportion to the versed sines of the equated anomaly.To make it more evident, this is clear in part from the following.Let the straight line BL be drawn from B perpendicular to CF, and about center A, with radius equal to BC, let an arc be drawn intersecting BL at L, and let AL be joined.Since the eccentric anomaly CBL is 90Â°, the versed sine will be CB, \n",

       " BL is also longer than Î±Î¿, and AL is longer than BL.Thus AL is much longer than Î±Î¿.Therefore, the sun appears smaller at the distance AL than at the distance Î±Î¿.But the distance Î±Î¿ was just now seen to be the mean between the maximum and the minimum.Thus at distance AL the sun appears less than the mean.So at L, even though half the semicircle of the eccentric has been traversed, less than half of the increase has been added to the sun's diameter.This is, of course, because the equated anomaly LAC is less than the half, 90Â°.And this was the problem that had tied us in knots in Ch.39, as was said in the preceding chapter (Ch.56).For if the planet's orbit had been a perfect circle, the increase of the sun's diameter would have been a measure of the increases of the versed sines of the eccentric anomaly, whose observation is more foreign to the planet's mind than is the observation of the equated anomaly, as we shall shortly hear.You can see from this contrast just how conveniently this measure is attributed to the planet, and how plausibly.We might suppose that the measure of the reciprocation (the versed sine  of the eccentric anomaly, as the observations show) is to be grasped directly by the mind.But then the planet's mind would be deprived of the assistance of the variable solar diameter, because it does not adjust itself to the versed sines of this anomaly of the eccentric.For the planet's path is not a circle.And the planet's mind would have to intuit the parts of the reciprocation, or the distances to be traversed in them, without any indicators.This we long ago rejected as absurd.It would also have to intuit the eccentric anomaly, which is the angle between two straight lines projected from the center of the eccentric, one through the aphelial point and the other through the center of the planetary globe.In the diagram, it is DBC (or if the line DK be projected from D parallel to BC, KDB is then the supplement of the same eccentric anomaly).Therefore, if the mind perceives the angle KDB, it must perceive the triad of the points K, D, B. Concerning the point D there is no problem, since it is the center of its globe.I am not much concerned about K, because, owing to the infinite distance of the fixed stars, BC and DK ultimately coincide at the same  location among the fixed stars, and the fixed stars are real bodies.Therefore there is no absurdity in holding that the planetâs mind uses some hidden sense to keep in view that fixed star which provides lodging for the aphelion at any planetâs mind, because B is not clothed in any body.Furthermore, when one removes the cause for keeping watch on B, the effect is also removed.But B ought to be watched if the circle CD is to be traversed.However, the planets' orbits are not perfectly circular, as was proven from the observations in Chapter 42.Therefore, the planets do not take aim at B. And thus this putative center B is actually secondary to the path CD.But if it were watched by the planet, it would be prior to the path.For these reasons, therefore, I deny that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly provides the planet with a measure of its reciprocation, not because this is not such a measure, but because even if it is, it is not discerned by the planet's mind.But if we suppose it to be the increasing and decreasing of the sun's diameter that serves as the means or aid by which the planet arrives at the correct distances (imperceptible in themselves) in its reciprocations, and then for the variation of this diameter of the sun, from the demonstration just completed, we posit a rule or measure, to be perceived by the planet's mind, [namely,] the equated anomaly of the eccentric, DAC, or rather, KDA, in the diagram,  we now stand closer to the truth.For both measures are perceptible: for the reciprocation, the increasing and decreasing magnitude of the sun's diameter, and for the measure, or angle, three points clothed in bodies.For at A there is the sun itself, at D the planet, and at K the fixed star that indicates the aphelia.Perhaps it ought therefore to be said (as indeed we also just embraced above in Ch.39, when we supposed that the forces of Nature were insufficient to administer the celestial motions) that there is attributed to the planet an ability to sense the light of the fixed stars and the sun, the confluence of whose radiations at the center of the planetary body gives an estimate of this angle of equated anomaly ^20.There is but one difficulty to clear up.For what reason is it not the angle itself  that is made to be the measure of the planetary operation (that is, to make the sun's diameter increase by approaching the sun), but the versed sine in place of the angle?*21  And by what means might the planet perceive the sine of the equated anomaly?Does it proceed in the way humans do, by geometrical reasoning?Nevertheless, hitherto no faculty of administering the celestial motions belongs to the planet's mind that could not have been acquired by a divine inspiration imparted at the very beginning of the world and lasting even to this day, without any reasoning whatever.Therefore, what was said just above should be repeated, namely that the sine of the equated anomaly is the index of the strength of the angles KDA: on this point, see Aristotle's Mechanics,22 and what was said above in this chapter.For when the two balance arms are disposed at an obtuse angle, they are more easily directed than when they are at a right angle, the ease of direction being proportional to the sines.And, on the other hand, when the two arms are connected at an acute angle, they are more easily made to move together into a single line, head-to-head, than if they were connected at a right angle.Refer again to the demonstration contained in what was just presented.Thus, in one way, if it makes sense for the planet to have a sense of the strength of the  angles, there will be no absurdity in our saying (using our human conception) that the sines of the angles are known to it.But why would it take note of the natural strength of the angles?(We are evidently returning to natural principles).As before, let there be certain regions of the planetary body in which there is a magnetic force of direction along a line tending towards the sun.However, contrary to the previous case, let it be an attribute, not of the nature of the body, but of an animate faculty of the sort that governs the body of the planet from within, that as it is swept along by the sun, it keeps that  magnetic axis always directed at the same fixed stars, except to the extent that it turns the axis a little over the ages.The result will be a battle between the animate faculty and the magnetic faculty, and the animate will win.It is no different from what we had said in Ch.34, that the bodies of the planets naturally seek rest, but are moved by the extrinsic force of the sun.Alternatively, here is a more apt example.The weight of the human arm naturally tends towards the center of the earth.However, in a flag bearer the animate faculty takes over and makes the weight extend over his head and wave in a circulatory motion.Here the animate faculty overcomes the natural weight, and would do so forever if the body of the flag-bearer together with all its faculties had not been created mortal.On the basis of these presuppositions, the planet's mind will be able to intuit and perceive the strength of the angle from the wrestling match between the animate faculty, which is designed to keep the magnetic axis in line, and the magnetic power of directing it towards the sun.This arrangement seems also to be confirmed by the example of the moon, which is incontestably more strongly propelled when it is on the diametral line of the sun and the earth, perhaps because of this strength of the angles.The final conclusion, then, will be this.A planet situated at aphelion makes no endeavor in the direction of the sun, but is carried along in proportion to the distance AC.The angle KDA results from its forward motion.In accord with the proportion of strength of this angle, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase by approaching the sun.In its approach, it diminishes the distance, making it AD.Since the distance is diminished, the forward motion is increased.Therefore, the angle KDA is changed more rapidly.Therefore, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase more rapidly (other things being equal).Thus is established a perpetual circulation which does not occur by leaps such as we have supposed in our thinking and calculation, ignoring imperceptible errors, but is quite continuous.What I have said so far holds conditionally, if the reciprocation supported by the observations cannot be performed by some magnetic power, implanted in the bodies of the planets, and if it has become absolutely necessary for us to have recourse to a mind.Otherwise, if a comparison between the natural motion and the mental one is in order, the former stands on its own, requiring nothing external, while the latter, the mental motion, appears to give evidence of the magnetic one, and to require its assistance, no matter how you equip it with an animate faculty of moving the body.For in the first place, mind by itself can do nothing to a body.It is therefore necessary to provide for the mind an adjunct faculty that performs its functions in making the planet's body reciprocate.This faculty will be either animate or natural and magnetic.It cannot be animate, for an animate faculty cannot transport its body from place to place (as this reciprocation requires) without the power of another assisting body.Therefore, it will be a magnetic, that is, natural, faculty of sympathy between the bodies of the planet and the sun.Thus the mind calls upon nature and the magnets for assistance.Second, at the halfway point in its pattern, which is the equated anomaly, it has traversed a greater part Î³Î¿ of its reciprocation above, and a smaller part Î¿Î¶ below, while completing half of its task, which consists of increasing or decreasing the sun's diameter.Nor do Î³Î¿, Î¿Î¶ correspond to parts of the time.For more time is consumed on Î³Î¿ than its excess over Î¿Î¶ required.Nor do the parts increase continuously from Î¶ to Î³, the ones about Î³, Îº being smaller, as well as those about Î¼, Î¶. The operations of mind, however, are accustomed to being constant.There was consequently a need for us to equip the mind with an animate faculty, as well as a magnetic one, and to contrive a battle between the two which would remind the mind of its duties, of which it could not have been reminded by the equality of either the times or the spaces traversed.So again we have asked nature to assist the mind.On the other hand, all these modifications really appertain to the workings of the sun's extrinsic magnetic power, and of the magnetic [power] joined to it, which inheres in the planet, as was explained above.If, therefore, the magnetic powers can do the job on their own, what need have they of the directing function of mind?Although we have remained uncertain about the magnetic force inherent in the planetary bodies, through our consideration of the earth's axis, which is different from the sun's line of apsides, this difficulty is common to both explanations.For even when we supposed a mind, we were compelled to admit the kind of axis that we wanted in the earth, through whose mediation the mind could apprehend the strength of the angle, or its versed sine.On the contrary, probability strongly urges us to ascribe this reciprocation of the planets, which without doubt is in accord with the laws of nature, entirely to nature, whatever may be the means by which it occupies the planet's bodies.Moreover, I do not know whether I have given sufficient proof to the philosophical reader of this perceptual cognition of the sun and the fixed stars, which I myself so easily accept, and bestow upon the planet's mind.Furthermore, in those very modes of operation which we have prescribed to the mind, the soundest of all those which were deemed possible appear to involve some geometrical uncertainty.I am not sure whether this might not be repudiated by God Himself, as to this point He has always been seen to proceed by the path of demonstration.For if a planet, insofar as it may have approached the sun partly by its inherent force, comes into one and another degree of extrinsic power from the sun (as it does indeed come); and if the different degrees also reciprocally intensify the planet's own force of approaching while they increase the angle, which is posited as the standard of measure23 of the approach, or of the increase of the sun's diameter; then the planet's own striving finally becomes in part its own measure, and simultaneously prior and posterior in the intensification of the planet['s force].For in its parts it is unequal, and for this reason it requires a measure.Thus, the search for the forces tempering both powers will be concluded by a kind of iterative method24 rather than deductively, so that they may complete their cycles in the same time, and in the same revolution of the body.Someone might, however, want to think he had found the cause of the  progression of the aphelia in the ungeometrical25 nature of this measure.But in Ch.35 we left it undecided whether this category of motion might not  exist through another cause, namely, occultation ^26.That is, just as a plate of iron intercepts the force of a magnet on a strip of iron, the bodies of the planets might also mutually intercept the magnetic powers proper to them, by which they incline towards the sun.And so that this might not happen to the solar powerâso that, I mean, the solar power, common to all, could not be intercepted for one planet by the interposition of anotherâwe have drawn a distinction between the essence of the solar body and that of the planets' bodies.So, since we have not drawn a distinction between the bodies of the planets themselves, this seems still to be a possible cause.It could, of course, not have been arranged thus unless the exact magnetic disposition of the planet's body, by which the reciprocation is administered, were known.But to give an example of reasoning: let the planet have a magnetic disposition of the sort which, though we had introduced it somewhat earlier, we later denied the earth to possess.In this disposition, impediment through occultation does not have any place.For because it was the effect of the magnetic power to tend towards the sun and to recede from the sun, meanwhile keeping the fibers of its magnetic seat in line, if another planet, coming between the sun and the planet, impedes this travel towards the sun, or recession from it, while not impeding the common motion from the sun, the planet will approach or recede less than it should, and thus the size of the circuit will be altered along with the periodic time, over the ages, and will again be corrected by contrary eclipses.However, the aphelion will not change position through this occultation.So the cause for the motion of the aphelia previously proposed by us still reigns alone, without peer or rival.Further, if a mind should preside over the reciprocation in the manner described, occultation will still do no harm.For as was said, the mind would use the angle of equated anomaly as its measure for increasing the sun's diameter; and, while deprived of the perception of it for a slight amount of time (that is, while the sun is hidden), it would be possible (the gods willing) to compensate for what the mind would have missed, upon the sun's re-emerging and restoring the equated anomaly into view.For mind (where there is one) is master of the animate faculty, and uses it differently and unequally according to circumstances.So why should it not use the animate faculty in an unusual manner here too, in removing the discrepancy between the measure (the equated anomaly) and the measured quantity (the sun's diameter) which had insinuated itself through the means of the sun's eclipse?What about other slow motions of this kind, such as the precession of the equinoxes arising from the earth's axis being directed at one or another of the fixed stars, and not at the sun?For here, the removal of the sun's light can have no effect, since its presence has no effect either.We would like to avoid the inconvenient effects of magnetic occultations  upon the reciprocations proper to the planets, just as we did in Ch.35 for the common revolving effect of the sun.It should therefore be said that the bodies of the planets can indeed be similar in their magnetic dispositions, but either (1) they are so far from one another that the planets' orbs of power would not overlap, or (2) the power coming from the sun is so strong (that which activates the planets' proper powers no less than that which makes them revolve in their orbs) that it could not be impeded at all by the interposition of a small, weak body, so that it would pass on through, just as light passes through a globe  of water, or (3) the bodies of the planets are so meager that they would have no effect, nor is the sun ever substantially blocked by any planet for any of the other planets moved by the sun, as the sun is never substantially blocked from the earth by the moon.For although the whole sun can be covered for the moon for several hours, the moon performs its reciprocation with respect to the earth, not the sun, and it can never be deprived of its perception of the earth since there is no body between the earth and the moon.Nevertheless, it might appear plausible to someone that the transposition  of the apogees is instantaneous, and occurs through the cause of the sun's being eclipsed.Let him say, if he please, that to prevent the reciprocation's undergoing a sudden leap of speed when it is interrupted by an eclipse, during which the planet is moved by the sun to another angle and another degree of its strength, this angular leap is compensated by the planet itself, by having its axis incline towards the sun at the same angle after the eclipse as it was at the beginning of the eclipse.For thus a transposition of the aphelia will be obtained, but one occurring by leaps, and remaining in the same sidereal position for many years, until there happens to be another occultation of the planet.On the other hand, the prior cause of the transposition of the aphelia,  arising from the reciprocation's aberration from its sidereal circuit, produced by the ungeometrical27 interconnection of its components, favors the uniform transposition of the apogees.Finally, if neither of these causes obtains, let the mind, furnished with an  animate faculty which presides over the constant direction of the magnetic axis, have the additional task of inclining the axis over the ages.But if none of these causes stands, nor even the general idea of a mind, let us be satisfied with nature, which, as she has allowed everything else to be disentangled, has also shown a splendid occasion for the motion of the aphelia.Chapter 58In what manner, while the reciprocation discovered and demonstrated in Chapter 56 holds good, an error may nevertheless be introduced in a wrongheaded application of the reciprocation, whereby the path of the planet is made puff-cheeked.With an apple Galatea seeks me, the lusty wench:She flees to the willows, but hopes I'll see her first ^1.It is perfectly right that I borrow Virgil's voice to sing this about Nature.For the closer the approach to her, the more petulant her games become, and the more she again and again sneaks out of the seeker's grasp just when he is about to seize her through more twists.Nevertheless, she does not cease to invite me to seize her, as though delighting in my mistakes.Throughout this entire work, my aim has been to find a physical hypothesis that not only will produce distances in agreement with those observed,  but also, and at the same time, sound equations, which hitherto we have been driven to borrow from the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16.So, while trying to use a false method to do the same thing through this hypothesis, which is itself perfectly correct, I began once again to fear for the whole undertaking.On the line of apsides, about centers A and B, let the equal circles GD, HK be described.And let AB be the eccentricity of the circle GD.Also, let the eccentric anomaly, or its number of degrees, be the arc GD or HK, by the equivalence established in Chapter 3.Next, about center K, with radius KD which shall be equal to AB, let the epicycle LDF be described, which will intersect the circle GD at D, through the equivalence established in Ch.3.Let AK be drawn, and extended to intersect the epicycle at L, so that the arc LD is similar to the eccentric anomaly GD or HK.And let BD be joined.Now, from D let perpendiculars be drawn to GA, LA, and let these be DC, DE.Therefore, by what has previously been demonstrated in Ch.56, AE will indubitably be the correct distance at this eccentric anomaly.The question remains how much time was taken to arrive at it.Now the versed sine of its arc, GC, which, after multiplication, becomes LE, when subtracted from GA, yielded the correct distance AE.These indications persuaded me that the other end of AE should be sought, not on the line DC (which was actually perfectly correct), but at the point I of the line DB, such that if I were to draw the arc EIF about center A with radius AE, it would intersect DB at I. Thus, according to this persuasion, AI would be the correct distance, both in position and length, and IAG would be the true equated anomaly.But it is manifest that the arc EIF would intersect the line DC at a higher place, namely, at F. Thus the angles IAG and FAG differ by the quantity IAF.I therefore erred in taking the line AI instead of AF ^2.I first discovered the error empirically.For when I explored the quantity of the area DAG, either using all the distances or using the small area DAB, and then fitted the angle IAG, rather than FAG, to this area DAG, now converted into time, in the upper part of the semicircle I found 5Â½â more, and in the lower half 4' less, than the vicarious hypothesis gave with sufficient certainty.And so, since the equations disagreed with the truth, I began once more to accuse these perfectly correct distances AE, and the planet's reciprocation LE, of the crime for which my false method, which took I in place of F, was to be blamed.What need is there for many words?The very truth, and the nature of things, though repudiated and ordered into exile, sneaked in again through the back door, and was received by me under an unwonted guise.That is, I rejected the reciprocation on the diameter LE, and began by recalling the ellipses, quite convinced that I was thus following an hypothesis far, far different from the reciprocation, although they coincide exactly, as will be demonstrated in the following chapter.The only difference was that the errors I committed in method earlier were corrected by this procedure, and that F was used instead of I, as it should have been.My line of reasoning was like that presented in Ch.49, 50, and 56.The circle of Ch.43 errs in excess, while the ellipse of Chapter 45 errs in defect.And the excess of the former and the defect of the latter are equal.But the only figure occupying the middle between a circle and an ellipse is another  ellipse.Therefore, the ellipse is the path of the planet, and the lunule cut off from the semicircle has half the breadth of the previous one, namely, 429.Moreover, if the planet's path were an ellipse, it was clear enough that I could not be taken in place of F, for if this is done, the planet's path is made to be puff-cheeked ^3.For let the angles QBP, SAR in the lower part be equal to GBD, HAK, and about center R let the epicycle PT again be described, equal to the previous one, and from P, the intersection of the epicycle with the eccentric, let perpendiculars PV, PM, be dropped to BQ, AR [respectively], and let PB be joined.And about center A, with radius AM, let the arc MN be described, intersecting PV at O, and PB at N. So, by analogy with the above, just as we are taking I in place of F, let us now take N for O, and let us consider that just as AN is the correct distance in length, it is also correct in position.Now the points I, N, and the like do indeed make the planet's path puff-cheeked.For the arcs GD and QP are equal.And BD, BP, projected from a common center, intersect the lunule cut off.But DI and PN, the breadths of the lunule extended towards the center, are unequal.And DI is smaller, and PN greater.For since ED and MP are equal, and EDI, MPN are right, while EI is a greater circle, since its radius AE is greater, and MN is a smaller circle, since its radius AM is smaller, therefore, PN will definitely be greater, and DI smaller.Therefore, the lunule cut off is narrower above, at D, and broader below, at P. In the ellipse, in contrast, this lunule is of equal breadth at points equally removed from the apsides G and Q. So it is clear that the path is puff-cheeked, so it is not an ellipse.And since the ellipse gives the correct equations, this puff-cheeked path should by rights give incorrect ones.Nor was there any need to compute the equations anew from the ellipse.I knew they were going to perform their function without further prompting.I was only concerned about the distances, that if they were taken from the ellipse they might cause me trouble.But although this did happen, I had already prepared a refuge, namely, the uncertainty of 200 units in the distances.Consequently, I did not hesitate much here, either.The greatest scruple by far, however, was that despite my considering and searching about almost to the point of insanity, I could not discover why the planet, to which a reciprocation LE on the diameter LK was attributed with such probability, and by so perfect an agreement with the observed distances, would rather follow an elliptical path, as shown by the equations.O ridiculous me!To think that the reciprocation on the diameter could not be the way to the ellipse!So it came to me as no small revelation that the ellipse is consistent with the libration.This will be made clear in the following chapter, where it will be demonstrated at the same time, through the agreement of arguments from physical principles with the body of experience, mentioned in this chapter, that is contained in the observations and in the vicarious hypothesis, that no orbital figure is left for the planet other than a perfectly elliptical one.Chapter 59Demonstration that when Mars reciprocates on the diameter of an epicycle, its orbit becomes a perfect ellipse; and that the area of the circle measures the sum of the distances of points on the circumference of the ellipse.Protheorems1I.</br> If an ellipse be inscribed within  a circle, touching it at its vertices at opposite points, and a diameter be described through the center and the points of contact, and further, if perpendiculars be drawn to the diameter from other points on the circumference of the circle, all these lines will be cut in the same ratio by the circumference of the ellipse ^2.Using Book I page3 21 of the Conics of Apollonius, Commandino4 proves this in his commentary on Proposition 5 of Archimedes' On Spheroids.Let there be the circle AEC with ellipse ABC inscribed in it, touching the circle at A and C, and let the diameter be drawn through the points of contact A and C, passing through the center H. Then from the points K and E on the circumference let the perpendiculars KL, EH be dropped, cut by the circumference of the ellipse at Î, B. BH will be to HE as ML is to LK, and so on for all other perpendiculars.IIThe area of an ellipse thus inscribed in a circle is to the area of the circle in the same ratio as the lines just mentioned.For as BH is to HE, so is the area of the ellipse ABC to the area of the circle AEC.This is Proposition 5 of Archimedes' On Spheroids.III.If from a given point on the diameter lines be drawn to the points on the perpendiculars where the circumferences of the circle and the ellipse intersect them, the areas cut off by these lines will again be as the segments of the perpendiculars.Let N be the point on the diameter and KML the perpendicular, and let K and M be connected with N. I say that as ML is to LK, or (by Protheorem I) as the shorter semidiameter BH is to the longer HE, so is the area AMN to AKN.For the area AML is to the area AKL as ML is to LK, by Archimedes' assumptions in On Spheroids, Prop.5, which Commandino demonstrates under letters C and D in his commentary on this proposition.But the altitude NL of the right triangles NLM, NLK is the same, and the bases are LM, LK; and consequently MLN is to KLN as ML is to LK.Therefore, by composition, the whole area AMN is to the whole area AKN as ML is to LK.Q. E. D.IVIf the circle be divided into any number of equal arcs by perpendiculars such as these, the ellipse is divided into unequal arcs; and the arcs that are near the vertices adopt the greatest ratio [to the arcs of the circle], while those in the middle positions adopt the least ratio ^5.For about the vertices the ratio of the arcs is close to the ratio of the perpendiculars cut off [by them], to which they closely approximate in length, although they are less.About the middle positions they are nearly equal, but the elliptical arcs are smaller because they are less curved than the circular ones.This is self-evident.VThe entire elliptical circumference is approximately the arithmetic mean between the circle on the greater diameter and the circle on the smaller diameter.For it was proved in Chapter 48 above that that circumference6 is longer [than the ellipse] whose diameter is the mean proportional between the diameters of the ellipse, the area of which circle, by Archimedes, On Spheroids Prop.7, being equal to the area of the ellipse.But, too, the arithmetic mean is longer than the mean proportional.Therefore, they are approximately equal.VIThe gnomons7 of squares divided proportionally are to one another as the squares.Let there be two squares, PL and SH.Let their sides KL, EH be divided proportionally at the points Î, B. Let the gnomons KOQ and CRE be described.Therefore, because ML is to LK as BH is to HE, OL will also be to LP as RH is to HS.But the gnomons are the differences of the squares.Therefore also, as LP is to its gnomon, so is HS to its, and permuted, as PL is to HS, so is the gnomon KOQ to the gnomon CRE.VIIIf from the end of the shorter semidiameter on the circumference of an ellipse, a line equal to the longer semidiameter be extended, ending at the longer semidiameter, the distance between that point of intersection and the center is equal in square to the gnomon that the square of the longer semidiameter places about the square of the shorter semidiameter ^8.From the end B of the shorter semidiameter HB, let the straight line BN be  extended, equal to the longer semidiameter AH.I say that HN is equal in square to the gnomon ERC, that is, that it is the mean proportional between EB and the remainder of the circle's diameter.This was proved in Chapter 46 above.But it is demonstrated more easily and briefly in the pure case here.For the gnomon is the difference of the squares BH and HE or HA, by the sixth of these protheorems.But the square on HN is also the difference of the squares BH and BN, that is, HE or AH, by Euclid I.46 ^9.Therefore, the square on HN is equal to the gnomon ERC.Q. E. D.VIIIIf a circle be divided into any number (or an infinity) of parts, and the points of division be connected with some point within the circumference of the circle other than the center, and also be connected with the center, the sum of the lines drawn from the center will be less than the sum of those from the other point.Also, a pair of lines close to the line of apsides drawn to opposite points10 from a point other than the center will be approximately equal to two drawn to opposite points from the center, while a pair so drawn at intermediate locations will be much greater than those drawn from the same center.This was proved in Chapter 40 ^11.So12 that excess does not increase uniformly with the number of lines, much less with the sines.For their differences vanish at the end, while the differences of the said excesses are greatest at the end.And since the area of the circle KNA increases uniformly, its part KHA increasing with the number of lines, by construction, and its part KNH with the sines of the arcs to which the lines are drawn, multiplied by HN, by Chapter 40, the area of the circle is therefore not adapted to the measure of the sum of the distances to its circumference ^13.IXIf, on the other hand, instead of the lines from the point other than the center, those lines be taken which are bounded by perpendiculars drawn from that point to the lines which are drawn through the centerâthat is, if, in  the terms of Ch.39 and 57, the diametral distances are taken in place of the circumferential onesâthen their sum equals the sum of those drawn from the center ^14.For let any point whatever on the circumference of the circle be chosen, K in the present instance, and from K let a straight line be drawn through H to the opposite part of the circumference I. Now from N let a perpendicular be dropped to KI, and let this be NT.Then KH, HI together, are equal to KT, TI together.And any sum of the pairs KH, HI, is equal to an equal sum of the pairs KT, TI ^15.And since, when AK is divided into any number of equal parts, the sum of the lines AN, KT to those parts increases partly with the number of lines HA, HK and partly with the sines multiplied by HN, the sum therefore increases uniformly with the area KNA, by the foregoing.Thus the area of the circle, and the parts KNA, are a measure of the sums of the diametral distances.XThe ratio of distances from a point not at the center of an ellipse to equal arcs of the ellipse, no less than those on the circle in Protheorem 8, is contrary to the ratio of arcs of the circle and the ellipse to one another, explained in Protheorem 4.For the pair drawn from the point not at the center exceeds the pair drawn from the center in opposite directions, in the least ratio, and nothing at all, at the apsides; but at the middle elongations they exceed the latter in the greatest ratio.This is clear from Chapter 40 ^16.So, again, as in Protheorem 8, the area of the ellipse is not suited to measuring the sums of the distances of equal arcs of its elliptical circumference ^17.XIWith these preliminaries completed, I shall now proceed to the demonstration.If in an ellipse divided by perpendiculars dropped from equal arcs of the circle, as in Protheorem 4 above, the points of division of the circle and the ellipse be connected to the point that was found in Protheorem 7, I say that those that are drawn to the circumference of the circle are the circumferential [distances], while those that are drawn to the circumference of the ellipse are the diametral, which are established at an equal number of degrees from the apsides of the epicycle.From the point I, opposite K from the center H, let IV be dropped perpendicular to AC, intersecting the elliptical circumference at Y. And from the point N found in Protheorem 7 let the lines NK, NM, and also NI, NY be drawn to the points of intersection K, M, and also I, Y made by the two perpendiculars, respectively.Further, let the diagram of Ch.39 and 57 be brought back, and let the semidiameter of the epicycle Î²Î³ be equal to the eccentricity HN, and the arc Î³Î´ beginning from the apsis Î±Î³ be similar to AK beginning from the apsis, and let Î±Î² equal the semidiameter HA.I say that NK is the circumferential distance Î±Î´ (this was proven in Ch.2) and NM is the diametral distance Î±Îº.First, KN is equal in square to the sum of the squares on KL and LN.Likewise, MN in square is equal to the sum of the squares on ML and LN.Let LP be the square on LK, and LO the square on LM.Thus when the square on LN and the square on LM (that is, the square LO), common to both, are subtracted, there remains the gnomon KOQ, by which the square on KN exceeds the square of, or on, MN ^18.Now as KL is to EH, so is KM to EB, by the first protheorem.Therefore also, as KQ, the square on KL, is to EC, the square on EH, so is the gnomon KOQ to the gnomon ERC, by Protheorem 6.And further, as KL, the sine of the arc AK, is to EH or AH, the whole sine, here in the eccentric circle, so is the perpendicular Î´Îº in the epicycle (from the point Î´ of the arc Î³Î´, which is similar to AK, to the diameter of the apsides Î²Î³) to the semidimeter of the epicycle Î²Î³.Therefore also, as the gnomon KOQ is to the gnomon ERC, so is the square on Î´Îº to the square on Î²Î³.But HN is equal to Î²Î³.And the square on HN is equal to the gnomon ERC, by Protheorem 7.Therefore the square on Î²Î³ is also equal to the gnomon ERC, and consequently, the square on Î´Îº, the perpendicular from the point on the epicycle just mentioned, will equal the gnomon KOQ.But the square on that perpendicular Î´Îº is the excess of the square on the circumferential distance Î´Î± over the square on the diametral distance ÎºÎ±.Therefore also, the gnomon KOQ, equal to it, is the excess of the square on Î´Î± over the square on ÎºÎ±.But KN is equal to Î´Î±.Therefore [the square on] KN exceeds [the square on] ÎºÎ± by the gnomon KOQ.But it also exceeds the square on MN by the same gnomon.Therefore, the diametral distances MN and ÎºÎ± are equal.Q. E. D. It also will be demonstrated likewise concerning NY, that it is equal to Î±Î¼, where Î¶Î· is similar to CI.And so for all.XII</br>Again, it is also clear from the same thatThe area of the circle, both as a whole and in its individual parts, is the genuine measure of the sum of the lines by which the arcs of the elliptical planetary path are distant from the sun's center.For by Protheorem 9, if the area of the whole circle is set equal to all the diametral distances of all the arcs of the division chosen, the parts of the area, as KNA, bounded  at the point N from which the eccentricity originates, are made equal to those diametral distances that belong to the arc KA enclosing that area.But by Protheorem 11, preceding, the diametral distances KT, TI, that is, ÎºÎ±, Î¼Î±, by Chapter 40, are the same as the distances MN, NY of the points Î, Y of the ellipse.Therefore, as the area of the circle is to the sum of the distances of the ellipse, so is the part of the area of the circle KNA bounded at the sun's center N, whence the eccentricity is measured, to the sum of the distances on the ellipse belonging to the elliptical arc AM having the same number of degrees as the arc of the circle enclosing the area AK ^19.XIIIHowever, the following doubt arises: if the area AKN is equivalent to all the distances of as many points on the elliptical arc AÎ from N as we have taken to be present on AK, what, then, would that elliptical arc be; that is, where would it end?For it seems that it should not end at the perpendicular line KL.The reason for this is that in this way, by Protheorem 4, unequal elliptical arcs correspond to equal arcs on the circle, and thus the arcs are less about the vertices A, C, and greater about B. However, it appears necessary to take equal arcs of the elliptical orbit, should we wish to estimate and compare the times of the planet to traverse them.To be specific: because it is certain that the end of this arc should be at the distance MN from N, therefore, as in Chapter 58, an arc MZ drawn about center N with radius NM somewhere indicates a point bounding this arc of the ellipse, and it appears that that point is going to be not M but Z, at which the arc intersects the line KH, making that arc of the orbit AZ.The reply is made that the arc of the ellipse whose time increments the area AKN measures should by all means be divided into unequal parts, with those near the apsides being smaller.For let it be that the actual path ABC of the planet be divided into equal arcs.Since the planet takes a longer time on arc A than on arc C proportionally as NA is longer than NC, while NA and NC taken together equal the longer diameter of the ellipse, and HB is the shorter semidiameter of the ellipse, the planet's amount of time on the arc at B and the opposite arc together will therefore be less than on the equal arcs at A and C together ^20.Therefore, to make the amount of time at A and C shorter, and at B and its opposite longer, thus making the amount of time on any two opposite arcs taken together the same, the arcs at A and C should be made smaller, and at B and its opposite, longer.But this is accomplished by the perpendiculars KML, as is clear from the objection itself.But by this solution we only discover with certainty that the arcs about A, C should be somewhat shorter.Whether the particular arcs determined by the perpendiculars KML are exactly the required arcs, is not yet established.But it will now be made clear, in the following manner.XIVIf someone were to divide an ellipse AMC into any number of equal arcs, assigning to each individually its distance from N, while taking the areas AMN,  ABN, ABCNA in place of the sum of the distances on AM, AB, ABC, by Protheorem 10 he would bring about the same error that occured in Ch.40 above when we tried to do on a perfect circle what we are here supposing to be tried on an ellipse.That is, two lines MN, NY from two points Î, Y opposite one another through center H, are taken as equivalent to the shorter line MHY.Suppose, however, that that same person were to divide an ellipse AMC into the same number of unequal arcs, contrary to Protheorem 10, according to the following law: the circle AKC being first divided into equal arcs, perpendiculars KL would then be drawn to AC from the ends of the individual arcs, cutting the ellipse AM into arcs also; and the elliptical area would be taken for the distances of these arcs from N. In that case, a remedy would be provided for the error which has been committed: a most perfect compensation.I shall prove this for the beginnings of the quadrants, A and C; for the ends, B; and the motion in between.At the beginnings of the quadrants A, C, if the two lines NA, NC be taken for the line AHC, there is no error.At the end, however, if for BN (that is, for EH) I take BH, the consequent error or defect is a maximum, by Protheorem 10, the amount being BE.And by Protheorem 7 of this chapter, as HE is to EB, so is the required length to the error committed at this position.Now, suppose that the sum total of all the distances receives a measure erring in defect, namely, the area of the ellipse.Then when the defect is distributed among the individual distances by the force of our operation or computation, it will happen that the distances NA, NC are taken too small with respect to this measure of all of them.We are thus deceived in thinking that all the lines err equally in defect, since NA and NC are not in fact in error.They do indeed add up to the correct sum, but when the sum is in turn distributed, NA and NC will not have received their correct value, because certain lines about B will have defrauded the whole.Let us now see how we can remedy this error in the same proportion.By Protheorem 4 of this chapter, the least arcs AK, AM about the apsides A or C are in the same ratio as KL to LM, that is, EH to HB.This was the ratio by which the lines about B formerly erred in defect.And at B, in turn, the least arcs of the circle and the ellipse, KE and MB, say, are equal; just as, before, the straight lines AN, NC together were equal to the line AHC.Therefore, as in the previous consideration of the straight lines, so will it be here in the consideration of the arcs: when the mean and uniform measure of the arcs is conceived, the arc at the apsides A or C will be short with respect to it, and the arc at the middle intervals B will be long.Thus where the  distances are too short with respect to their erroneous sum, in the faulty area of the proposed ellipse, the arcs will be small with respect to their mean value, as at A, C; and where the distances are too long, the arcs are too long, as at B. And so to the extent that we accumulate too small an interval of time in our calculation, owing to the rather short distances at the apsides, there are that many more distances on that arc, it being cut into small parts each of which has its own assigned distance.And inversely, to the extent that about the middle intervals B more time is accumulated by the individual distances than is fitting in our calculation, when we carried over to the innocent apsides A, C, the part of the defect at this location, the calculation has collected correspondingly fewer distances, they having been obtained from the large parts of the arc by begging.At that place (A and C), what the individual distances cannot do owing to their brevity in the calculation, they accomplish by their being closely spaced, with the result that they accumulate the correct time intervals.And here, the error arising in the calculation occasioned by their excessive length is again removed by their being more widely and loosely spaced.Of the beginning and end, I have said that both the arcs of the circle at A and C and the correct distances differ at the beginning from those that the area of the ellipse accumulates, in the same ratio that EH has to HB; and that the arcs at BE and the distances at A and C end up differing by the same ratio, namely, the ratio of equality.We must now state the same for the progress in between.The lines NA, NC, from small beginnings, by swift increments exceed the lines AHC by a perceptible amount.On the other hand, where the excess is greatest, as that of BN over HB, the increments are slowed down perceptibly.They are greatest in the middle, near an eccentric anomaly of 45Â°.This is to some extent shown by the angle and secants of the equation.For BN differs from BH by about the same amount as the secant of the angle of the optical equation differs from the whole sine, while the opposite angles of the equations assist each other in the same ratio.Now the increments of the secants of the optical equation at about 45Â° are near a maximum, and are slow at the beginning and end of the quadrant.Concerning these, see the end of Ch.43.Furthermore, the increments of the elliptical arcs marked off by the perpendiculars KL progress in the same ratio.For at the beginnings, A and C, the arc AK, always beginning from A, is to its increment as LK is to KM.But the whole arc itself is small, and so the increment is small as well.At the end, near B, the ratio of AE to AB is reduced nearly to equality, even though the arc AB is large, since it is near the quadrant.Therefore, the increment is again small.So it is at the middle, about 45Â°, that the increment of the arcs is most evident.It is thus clear that in the intermediate progress, too, the ratios are equal, so far as minute consideration can be carried.Although the demonstration is most certain, it is likewise gauche and ungeometrical,21 at least in that part pertaining to the progress of the intermediate increases.As elsewhere, I would like to have this small part carried out geometrically and with finesse,22 so that even an Apollonius would be satisfied.Meanwhile, until someone else discovers and provides us with this small part, we should be content with what we have.XVBut let us complete the proof.The arc of the ellipse whose time is measured by the area AKN, should end on LK, so it would be AM.For hitherto we have been proceeding on the fiction that if anyone had so much leisure as to want to compute the area of the ellipse, it would turn out that in using the area of the ellipse AMN in place of the same number of distances of AM as there are equal arcs on AK, he would not miss the mark.Let this serve us as the previously demonstrated major premise of the proposition.I shall now add the minor premise, derived from Protheorem 3 of this chapter.Here it was shown that the area AKN is to the area AMN as the area AKC is to the area AMC.The conclusion therefore is, since the ratio of equimultiples is the same, that the area of the circle AKN also measures the sum of the diametral or elliptical distances (such as KT, TI) on AM, there being as many as there are parts in AK.Whence it is clear that I correctly assigned more closely spaced distances to the parts of the ellipse about A, C: that is, the same number of distances as there were intersections made by the perpendiculars KL coming from equal arcs of AK.So that no one may doubt the truth of this, confused by the subtlety and perplexity of the argument, this truth previously came to be known through experience, in the following manner.At the individual degrees of eccentric anomaly, I set up the diametral lines KT, TI in place of the distances from N. I also added each in order to the sum of the previous ones.When all were collected, the sum was \n",

       " would be to 360 degrees (the nominal value of the whole periodic time) as the individual sums would be to the increments of time they signify.This produced exactly the same results, down to the last second, as would have come out had I multiplied half the eccentricity by the sine of the eccentric anomaly, [added the area of the sector contained by the eccentric anomaly], and compared [the sum] to the area of the circle, which would be given the same value of 360 degrees (the nominal value of the periodic time) ^23.Then, when I was of the opinion that the correct distance NM should be applied to the line KH, becoming ZN, and had thus investigated the equated anomaly ZNA, attributing it to the mean anomaly AKN, the equations disagreed obviously with my vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16.At about 45Â°, the difference between the equated anomaly and the true value found through experience in the observations was a defect of about 5Â½ minutes, and near 135Â° about 4 minutes.But when NM24 was so applied as to end on KL, then when the equated anomaly MNA was applied to the mean anomaly AKN, it agreed exactly with the vicarious hypothesis, that is, with the observations.And when the fact was established, I was afterwards driven, once I had settled on the principles, to seek the cause of the matter which I have revealed to the reader in this Chapter as skillfully and lucidly as possible.And unless the physical  causes that I had originally taken in the place of principles had been good ones, they would never have been able to withstand an investigation of such exactitude.If anyone thinks that the obscurity of this presentation arises from the perplexity of my mind, I shall myself only thus far acknowledge to him my guilt, that I was unwilling to leave anything untested, no matter how utterly obscure, and not strictly necessary to the practice of astrology, which many deem the sole end of this celestial philosophy.But as for the subject matter, I urge any such person to read the Conics of Apollonius.He will see that there are some matters which no mind, however gifted, can present in such a way as to be understood in a cursory reading.There is need of meditation, and a close thinking through of what is said.Kepler's woodcut of the planet's magnetic body (p.414), showing the boatman and his oar pulling the planet along.Kepler's woodcuts for the diagrams in Protheorem 11 (opposite).Note Urania in her triumphal chariot coming to crown Kepler with a laurel wreath for his conquest of the war god;

and opposite the sun, retrograde, low, and large; while in between it becomes stationary and of a medium size.The Latin authors considered that in the sunâs aspects and rays there is a force by which the other planets are in fact attracted.Their opinion cannot be shown numerically, because it is not astronomical.But it is also improbable, now that the true causes have been found, and manifestly false, since Saturn begins to retrogress at quadrature with the sun, or beyond; Jupiter, at trine; Mars, at biquintile or before sequiquadrate, and all at variable distances ^1.Ptolemy said that at a determined point on the planetary circle that serves for the first inequality, there is fixed, not the planet itself, but the center of an epicycle bearing the planet fixed upon its circumference, which is in turn borne by the planetâs chief circle.The motion has the following form: if the center of the epicycle be in conjunction with the sun, the planet is also at the highest point of the epicycle and is moved along with the sun in the same direction, [and] when the sun, which is faster, departs from the center of this epicycle, the planet simultaneously descends on the epicycle.But since the epicycleâs motion about its center is faster than the motion of its center about the earth, it hence happens that when the planet traverses the lower parts of the epicycle while the epicycleâs center is at opposition to the sun, the compounding of motions makes it actually retrograde.Thus Ptolemy made his opinions correspond to the data and to geometry, and has failed to sustain our admiration.For we still seek the cause that connects all the epicycles of the planets to the sun, so that they always complete their periods when their centers are in conjunction with the sun.Copernicus, with the most ancient Pythagoreans and Aristarchus, and I along with them, say that this second inequality does not belong to the planetâs own motion, but only appears to do so, and is really a by-product of the earthâs annual wheeling around the motionless sun.In this way, just as in Ch.1 the diurnal motion was separated from the motion proper to the planets, the second inequality of the planets is likewise now separated from the first by Copernicus, and in quite the same way.For some practitioners admit that the first motion is extrinsic to the planets, but still think it is in fact in the planets, inserted into them, so that the planets, too, are moved with the same motion.Copernicus holds that it is neither intrinsic to the planets nor inserted, but only attached to them through an optical illusion.For while the earth rotates upon its axis from west to east, it appears to our eyes that the rest of the world rotates from east to west.It is, I claim, in just the same way that Copernicus asserts that the planets do not really become stationary and retrograde, but  only appear so.For he says that since the earth is in addition carried along by another motion, which is annual, in a very large circle (which he calls the orbis magnus), those who believe that the earth is at rest think that the planets and the sun are carried in the opposite direction; and he says that when the sun is between the planet and the earth, in the appearance the motions of the earth and the planet in are added, whence the planet appears to be swift; and when, on the other hand, the earth is between the sun and the planet, the planet is apparently left behind and thus retrogresses, owing to the earthâs being swifter than the planet.Tycho Brahe holds something in common with the Latins: although the sun does indeed not attract the planets through the aspect, the planets do fawn upon the sun.For he says that they strive to keep the sun (although it is moving) nearly in the middle of their circuits, and indeed, that they arrange their real paths around the sun as if it were motionless.Thus any given planet, besides its own path, traverses the sunâs path in the aethereal air, and out of these motions compounded with one another there is produced exactly what Ptolemy had (that is, a spiral), as described in Ch.1.In astronomical terms, Ptolemy put epicycles on eccentrics, while Brahe put eccentrics on a single epicycle, which is the sunâs orb itself.I, in the demonstrations that follow, shall link together all three authorsâ forms.For Tycho, too, whenever I suggested this, answered that he was about to do this on his own initiative even if I had kept silent (and he would have done it had he survived), and on his death bed asked me, whom he knew to be of the Copernican persuasion, that I demonstrate everything in his hypothesis.Furthermore, we shall demonstrate, both right here and through the entire book (though while doing other things), that these three forms are absolutely, perfectly, geometrically equivalent.For the present we must carry out what we set out for ourselves and what is to be demonstrated, namely, that there is a very great error indeed in the second inequality if the apparent position of the sun is replaced by its mean position, to which the planet is at opposition at the beginning of this second inequality.I shall begin with the Copernican opinion ^2.About center Î² let the earthâs eccentric Î³Ï be described, such as Copernicus, putting his trust in Ptolemy, imagined.Let Î³Î² be its line of apsides, Îº the position of the motionless sun, and Î² the point about which the earthâs motion is uniform.Through Î² and perpendicular to Î²Î³ let ÏÎ²Ï be drawn, intersecting the circumference at points Ï and Ï, and let Ï and Ï be joined to Îº.Copernicus, intending to transfer the Ptolemaic numbers into his own form of hypothesis, reckoned the eccentricities of the planets from the conjectural center Î² of the earthâs uniform motion rather than from the sun Îº. For if lines be drawn from Î² (as Î²Î³, Î²Ï, Î²Ï), whenever a planet and the earth lie upon one of these, the planet was supposed to shed the second inequality, to which it was subject on account of the earthâs motion, as, for example, if the earth were at Ï and the planet were found on Î²Ï extended.In effect, by adopting this procedure, Copernicus established a fictitious  observer at the point Î². For provided that the planet is on the line Î²Ï, it makes no difference for the purpose of designating its sidereal position whether it be viewed from Ï or from Î². The same may be truly said of the lines Î²Î³, Î²Ï, and all the other infinite lines intersecting at Î². Therefore, Î² is the point of intersection of all the lines of vision, and is thus the fictitious common point for all observers.In fact, however, the point of vision is the earth, our home, which is found at one or another point on the circle ÏÎ³Ï at various times.So Copernicus believed the planet was freed from the second inequality whenever the planet and the earth were found on any one line passing through Î². Consequently, he endeavored to find the apparent sidereal position of a planet at those moments of opposition to the mean position of the sun through mathematical instruments.For if the planetâs position was found on one of the nights near the planetâs opposition to the sun, and if at that time the mean position of the sun was found by calculation to be at the point precisely opposite, then that was the moment of time desired.However, if there was still a little distance between them on that night, then he tracked down this moment of time, and the point or position held by the planet at this moment, by a comparison of two or more nights and of the diurnal motions of Mars and the earth over the interval.When he had done this as many times and in as many places  on the zodiac as he thought necessary (suppose, for example, Î²Î³, Î²Ï, Î²Ï), the practitioner now began to use these known sidereal or zodiacal positions of the planet, Î²Î³, Î²Ï, Î²Ï, to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality.This involved finding the magnitude of the planetary circle's eccentricity from the selected point Î², and the parts of the zodiac into which the apogee points, by comparing the angles which the observed positions set up about the point of observation Î², with the time intervals between them.The method of this undertaking, however, I shall present clearly in its proper place, below.Suppose these things already done, giving a line of apsides Î²Î´, eccentricity of the equant point Î²Î´, and the center of the eccentric on this line at the point Î», and let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the moment of opposition to the sunâs mean position.Now, Kepler, what more could you ask of Copernicus?Are you denying that this hypothesis corresponds entirely to observations or to astronomersâ experience?3 That is indeed not in question at present.Nor was I, when I first entered upon this undertaking, tempted by the observations to take up a different opinion.But it is this that I have been wanting: Let Î²Î´ be extended so as to intersect the eccentric at Ï and Î¾, and near Ï let some point Ï on the eccentric be chosen, and lines be drawn from Ï to Î´ and Î». Now ÏÏ is the measure of the angle ÏÎ»Ï, while the angle ÏÎ´Ï is greater than the angle ÏÎ»Ï by the amount Î´ÏÎ», and Î´ is the point of temporal uniformity ^4.Therefore, the time designated by ÏÎ´Ï is greater, with respect to the whole periodic time designated by four right angles, than is the arc  ÏÏ with respect to the whole circumference.The planet, then, is actually slower over the arc ÏÏ (this is not just an optical illusion), and fast over the opposite arc; and at Ï it is slowest, and at Î¾ it is fastest.Nevertheless, it is not farthest from the sun Îº when it is at Ï, nor is it nearest Îº at Î¶. But by all the arguments, even the testimony of the very hypothesis set up upon Î² which I am refuting, it is fitting that this real slowing down of the planet arises from its moving away from the body of the sun, and the speeding up from its approach to the sun itself, seated at Îº. On the other hand, it is impossible even to conceive of how a force could inhere in point Î², which has no body, rather than in k, quite nearby, in which there is the sun, the heart of the world, which force would drive the planet around more swiftly or slowly according to its approach and recess.Furthermore, even if one who is not prepared to admit that the slowings and quickenings arise physically from the close interconnection of the eccentrics, should consequently assert that these affects of motion are naturally under the control of the motive faculties residing in the body of the planet, we will again maintain the same probable conclusion.For what would be the reason why thoseminds would bypass the point Îº (which has a geometrical affinity for motion, being invested with a body of no small magnitude) and pay attention to the point Î², only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities)5 of the solar body distant from the sun, empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone?Even Copernicus himself admits, in Book 5 Ch.16, that the sun is really fixed at Îº, wherefore the eccentricity Î´Îº is constant, while he holds that the point Î², which he takes as the center of the annual orb, is displaced over the ages, thus making Î²Î´ shorter.Thus either Î² is no longer in the center of the world today, or it was previously not there.But it is probable either that the motion originates from the center of the world, or that the moving minds pay attention to the center of the world, and thus not to Î² but to Îº, which Copernicus says is fixed, as the center of the world should be.Led by these probable arguments, I concluded that the line of apsides taken in order to produce the planetâs first inequality, ought to go right through Îº itself rather than Î². But we shall obtain this result when we make use of the sidereal positions which the planet has at the moment when the sunâs apparent position and its own are opposite.And when the points Îº and Î² are collinear with the earth Î³, and when the planet itself falls on the same line at the same time, as at Ï, it is at the same moment at opposition to both the sunâs mean position and its apparent position.Its position is the same whether it be designated by Î²Ï or by ÎºÏ extended out to the fixed stars, and the planet is truly stripped of its second inequality, whether it depends upon the earthâs apparent position or its mean position.But when the earth comes to the side of its eccentric, or rather the middle intervals,6 a fairly large difference arises between them.For let the earth have traveled from Î³ to Ï (that is, let the sun, directly opposite, have moved from perigee in Capricorn to Aries), and let the line of the sunâs mean position ÏÎ² be found in Aries, while the line upon which the planet is observed in Libra be exactly opposite, namely, ÏÏ.Now since ÏÎº is farther eastward beyond ÏÎ², the sunâs apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.And since Ï is the observerâs home, the earth, and Ï is the planet, and both are going down towards Î¾, the earth Ï more swiftly, the line ÏÏ will at a later time be still more inclined to the line of the  sunâs visible position ÏÎº.Therefore the apparent opposition precedes the mean.So, at a time preceding the moment designated by Î²Ï (call it Î²Î¸), the planet will fall upon a line drawn from Îº through Î¸, that is, at Î¶. And then the planetâs line of vision Î¸Î¶ (as the less experienced should diligently note) lies farther eastward beneath the fixed stars than the line ÏÏ of the later time.This is because, although Î¸Î¶ precedes the line ÏÏ in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if Î¸, Ï, and absolutely all points on the earthâs circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars.Therefore, it is not the distance of the endpoints Î¸ and Ï but the inclination of the lines Î¸Î¶ and ÏÏ that causes the lines to strike upon different zodiacal positions, since they would be perceived as coinciding if they were parallel.But that Î¶ is inclined towards Ï is clear from the supposition that the planet is moved from Î¶ to Ï in the same time that the earth is moved from Î¸ to Ï. For the earth is swifter than the planet.Therefore, the earth traverses a greater space Î¸Ï than does the planet along Î¶Ï.But it can be shown even more easily that at an earlier time the planet is farther east, since at opposition it is retrograde, as is clear to everyone.It is therefore clear what is altered in the positions stripped of the second inequality, in this transition from the mean to the apparent positions of the sun.For, at Ï and the point opposite, the original positions remain; Î±t Î¶ Î¿r Ï an addition is made to the observed position, since Î¸Î¶ (as was said) is farther eastward than ÏÏ.A subtraction is made in the intervening time, because Î¸Î¶ is the line of vision at an earlier time than is \n",

       " the opposite position the outcome is the contrary, that is, an addition is made to the time and a subtraction from the position.Accordingly, these positions of the planet differ considerably from the original ones.And therefore, the operation set up in this new way produces quite different results.That is, since we have transferred the fictitious point of observation to the sun Îº (by virtue of our having viewed the planet when it was at Ï and Î¶ and the earth was on the lines ÎºÏ and ÎºÎ¶, namely, at the points Î³ and Î¸), the eccentricity will now originate at the point Îº. But in Ch.5 above, it was shown that when the observer is shifted from Î² to Îº and a line is drawn from Îº through the original point of uniformity Î´, although this new hypothesis does result in a new eccentric, it is one that, for the observer at Î², leaves nearly all his appearances undisturbed.So, by joining Î´Îº, dividing it at Î¼ so that Î´Î» is to Î´Î¼ as Î´Î² is to Î´Îº, tracing out a new eccentric Î·Îµ about Î¼ equal to the previous one Î¾Ï, and drawing a new line of apsides through ÎºÎ´, a new hypothesis will be formed, whose apsis is at Î·. Previously, however, we had improperly called Ï the apogee, because the Copernican center Î² on the line ÏÎ² was the successor to the Ptolemaic position of the earth.Now, following my own notions, we shall call Î· the aphelion (since we are in the Copernican hypothesis), and the  point opposite it perihelion, because the sunâs distance from Î· is a maximum ^7.It has been said how this pair of opinions, mine and those of the authorities, differ as regards physics.It has also been shown how each is to be constructed geometrically in the Copernican form.Third, it has been driven home that in astronomical terms those opinions8 do not differ in any important way at the moments of conjunction and opposition9.The next thing for me to do is to demonstrate what remained unexplained in Ch.5 above, that there is a considerable difference between the two hypotheses if you are required to use  them to compute the planetâs position outside the acronychal location ^10.If a line be drawn through the centers of the eccentrics Î», Î¼, parallel to Î²Îº, and extended to intersect each eccentric in two points, above and below, there will be set up, below, the maximum space ÎµÏ between the two, equal to Î»Î¼.But because it is lines from Î´, not those from Î», that designate certain unchanged moments of time, which is what we need here, let Î´Ï be drawn intersecting the eccentrics at Îµ and Ï, so that at one and the same moment the planet on one might be at Îµ and on the other at Ï. When the earth is on the line Î´Ï, at Ï, the planet, whether it is at Îµ or Ï, will in either case be seen at the same place on the zodiac.For, optically considered, the line ÎµÏ appears as a point.But when the earth departs towards either side of this line, the magnitude of the line ÎµÏ appears greater and greater, since it is viewed obliquely.It is required to find the point on the earthâs orb from which the lines of vision passing through Îµ and through Ï are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at Ï when it should have been placed at Îµ.First, the angle will be greater down at Îµ than up near Ï because the earthâs orbit, described about Î², moves the observer nearer to ÎµÏ than to Ï. Next, since Î´Ï is beyond ÏÎ², ÎµÏ is seen more obliquely from the left side than from the right.It will consequently appear less at the former place than at the latter even when the distances of the earth from the line Î´Ï are equal.Therefore, the point we are to find is on the right side.I say  that ÎµÏ subtends a maximum angle of vision when the observer is stationed at the point where a circle drawn through Îµ and Ï is tangent to the earthâs circle.For let such a circle be described through ÎµÏ tangent to the circle ÏÏ on the side towards Ï, and let the point of tangency be Î½. From Îµ and Ï let lines extend both to the tangent point Î½ and to several other points of circle ÏÏ before and after the point of contact.Now since circles touch one another in one and only one point, the sides of all angles extending from Îµ and Ï and meeting with points on circle ÏÏ will therefore be cut by the circle through ÎµÏ, with the exception of those that terminate at the tangent point of the circles, Î½. But the sides from Îµ and Ï that are cut by the circle ÎµÏ before they intersect would form a greater angle had they intersected at either of the points of section,11 by Euclidâs Elements I.21.And by Euclid III.21, all angles at the circumference set up on segment ÎµÏ are equal.Therefore, the one at Î½ (the point of contact) is greater than all the others.q.e.d.Next, to investigate its magnitude in appropriate numbers, we need to find ÎµÏ and also the perpendicular from Î² to Î´Ï.We shall find both by solution of the triangles Î´Î»Ï and Î´Î¼Îµ.Now we said above12 that in Î´Î»Ï, Î´Î» is \n",

and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Braheâs observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight.For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycleâs diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times.That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch.8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions.Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet?Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly.The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point?Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself.Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination.We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once.But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planetâs body.For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds.Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body?And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place?And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest?Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant.For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear.These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy.But something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us.For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point Î¥ (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked Î£, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself?Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of Î¥ around the earth K, since there is no body at Î¨?Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines ÎÎ£ of the sunâs apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sunâs apparent position.Again (as before) when the sun Î, the center of the sunâs eccentric Î¨, and the earth Î are on the same line, so that the line of the sunâs apparent position Î¨Î and the line of its mean position ÎÎ coincide, then for the center of the epicycle Î¤ this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by ÎÎ¤ or by Î¨Î¤, and the planet is really on the line ÎÎ¤ or Î¨Î¤ and at the lowest point on its epicycle Î¦, since here it is nearest to both Î¨ and Î. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality.But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.For let the sun have gone from Î to Î£, and the line of the sunâs mean position ÎÎ¥ be found in Aries, and the planetâs line of vision ÎÎ© precisely opposite in Libra, so that Î¥ÎÎ© is a single line.Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet Î© on this line of vision ÎÎ© is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle Î on the line ÎÎ©.But since ÎÎ£ has gone beyond ÎÎ¥, the sunâs apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.And in the last part of the time, ÎÎ© is not descending, so as to be opposite ÎÎ£, but ascends towards ÎÎ¦, because the lowest parts of the epicycle Î© are retrograde and swifter than the center Î, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.Therefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by ÎÎ¥ (let it be ÎÎ) when the sun is seen on the line ÎÎ, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at Î) on ÎÎ which forms a straight line with ÎÎ.Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line ÎÎ, say at Î. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time ÎÎ prior to ÎÎ¥ the planet is on the line ÎÎ later than at ÎÎ©.But ÎÎ and ÎÎ© are parts of the lines ÎÎ and ÎÎ.Therefore, ÎÎ too is more to the east than ÎÎ.Thus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycleâs center by this restoration from the sunâs mean position to its apparent position.For at Î¤ and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycleâs center remain unchanged.At Î this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one.That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller.And since in the greater quadrant ÎÎ of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle.Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from Î§ towards Î.</br>The quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus.It is presupposed that the planet Î© falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle Î through the earth Î, only when ÎÎ is collinear with ÎÎ£, the sunâs apparent position.Therefore, ÎÎ£ and the line drawn from Î through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel.Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sunâs mean position was ÎÎ¥, drawn through Î©, the planet was observed on the line ÎÎ©, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle Î is on ÎÎ© at the same time.Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planetâs position Î© parallel to ÎÎ£, and let this be Î©Î.We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line Î©Î, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as Î© (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from Î on the line ÎÎ.Let Î©Î be drawn from whatever point on the line ÎÎ (now, it is Î©), equal to Î©Î.From Î let a line be drawn to ÎÎ parallel to ÎÎ¨, and let this be ÎÎ.Now since ÎÎ©Î is equal to ÎÎ£Î¨, and ÎÎ£ is imperceptibly greater than Î¨Î£  or Î©Î (because ÎÎ¨Î£ is right, and the angle at Î£ is not greater than 2Â° 3â, so that if Î¨Î£ is \n",

       "), ÎÎ is also imperceptibly less than ÎÎ¨.Let ÎÎ be joined, and let a line be drawn at Î parallel to ÎÎ.Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at Î by Ptolemy and at Î by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line ÎÎ¥ in the theory of the sun.In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by ÎÎ, because Î is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to ÎÎ.Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through Î.Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy's account) is at the other end of the line of the sunâs mean position in the neighborhood of ÎÎ¥ (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove).Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line ÎÎ drawn from Î to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to ÎÎ or Î¨Î, equal to ÎÎ, and very nearly equal to Î¨Î, and the new Î will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis.But at the end of Ch.5 above, it was shown that if through Î a line ÎÎ be drawn parallel to ÎÎ¨, ÎÎ¨ being equal to ÎÎ, and if the new Î be joined to Î, and the new line ÎÎ be cut at Î in the same ratio in which the previous ÎÎ was cut at Î, then by this new hypothesis a new eccentric is constructed, that is, one having a different position from the former, which even if applied in the prior hypothesis would still leave all the appearances to an observer at Î very nearly undisturbed.Let such a new eccentric be described about Î, equal to the former, and let ÎÎ be extended in both directions.The new apogee will be Î, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points Î, Î, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at Î and farther at Î than before.However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis.(This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sunâs eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicusâs and Tychoâs discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.)The reason is not that the point of equality Î does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sunâs apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval ÎÎ.Also, from this distance of the centers there necessarily follows an equal distance of the positions of the planetary body.Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sunâs middle distances.For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from ÎÎ.It is therefore greatest near the sunâs apsides, and greater near perigee on ÎÎ extended so as to intersect the eccentrics at Î¡ and Î. For Î¡Î is of the same magnitude as ÎÎ.But this one line ÎÎ does not designate the same moment, since it is not Î or Î that is the point of equality, but Î. Therefore, let parallels be drawn from ÎÎ towards Î¡ and Î, which shall designate the same moment, and let them be ÎÎ¡ and ÎÎ.Also, let the epicycles Î and Î  be described about Î¡ and Î.The question now is, where would this discrepancy appear greatest, in terms of the circumference of the epicycle?It is certain that this does not occur at the parts of the epicycle nearest Î, the earth, because these parts would be in the same direction as Î, nor at the highest parts of the epicycle, because they would be too far away.Therefore, this will occur at the parts of the epicycle near perigee, therefore when the sun, and the planet with it, are not exactly at perigee but nearby: namely (to put it briefly) at the points Î and Î  corresponding to the same moment of time, such that the small circle through them and Î is a minimum.The center of this small circle is, moreover, on the line through Î which, extended upward and meeting Î¡Î likewise extended, makes an angle of 7Â½ degrees.Let anyone who disagrees with this adapt the previous demonstration to the present conditions.The numbers are just the same, except for Ptolemy ÎÎ is greater than Î¼Î», in the numbers taken above.For this reason, the difference in apparent  position, ÎÎÎ , is also greater.For previously, Î²Îº was to Î»Î¼ as Î´Î² was to Î´Î», which is less than half Î´Î².To Ptolemy, ÎÎ</br>(equal to Î²Îº) would be to ÎÎ as the whole ÎÎ is to the half, ÎÎ.Finally, I shall deduce the same things in the Tychonic hypothesis.About center B let the solar eccentric GS be described, with line of apsides BG, C the position of the immobile earth, and B the point of equality, following the opinion of the authorities.For it will be shown in due course that the point of equality and the center of the eccentric are not the same in the theory of the sun.Upon BC let the perpendiculars BS and CV be erected, and let SC be joined, so that CV may be the line of the sunâs mean position, and CS, of its apparent position.Now, although Tycho Brahe had never finally decided whether to refer the planets to the lines CV, or to CS instead, in his initial conception he used the lines CV, according to the explanation he left in the Progymnasmata, vol.I p.477 and vol.II p.188.This is the way shown him by the footprints of Ptolemy and Copernicus.Of this path trodden by Tycho (if we proceed on it with Ptolemyâs views), it should be said that whenever a planet is on one of the lines of the sunâs mean position CV, on the side opposite the sun, the planet is divested of its second inequality, which, in Braheâs opinion, is applied to it on account of the motion of the center of the eccentric around the earth in the same time as the sun does so.This common point, with respect to which all the planets are said to perform their eccentric motion, and at which the whole planetary system is  conceived as being attached to the sunâs orbitâthis point, I say, is always on the line of the sunâs mean position, distant from the earth C by a constant distance BS, and describing a concentric V equal to the eccentric GS.This was Tycho Braheâs opinionâexcept that he denied solid orbs.So what we said about the attachment of the whole system to the sunâs orbit, we said to win over those who believe in solid orbs.Let VC be extended, and let the planet be on that line beyond C. In this configuration, Brahe will place the point at which the planetary system is attached at V. The planet will be observed on the line VC.So, even though the observer is on the earth, C, it is exactly as if he were at V, the point upon which the first inequality depends.Next, let the planetâs sidereal position be taken with instruments whenever it shall be seen at some point on the line CV opposite V beyond C (let this be on the lines CV, CG, and points opposite).Thus the center of the planetary system will be on the circle VP, the sun at S and G, and the body of the planet opposite it at O and F.(Nevertheless, in the theory of Mars, the planetâs eccentric is so small in proportion to the sunâs eccentric that Marsâs eccentric and the points O and F are nearer to the earth C than is the sun S, which was one of the reasons why Brahe denied the solidity of the orbs.)From many positions of this sort, as many, in fact, as he could obtain, Tycho Brahe used to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality, by removing the magnitude of the orb VP and treating it as a single point, as though in the meanwhile the center VP of the planetary  system, the point at which the system is attached, had remained at rest.So he set up a comparison of the elapsed times with the angles which VO and PF, drawn from a single point (V and P coinciding), would form.These are in fact identical to the angles OCF and VCP.Suppose this treatment done, and let the line of apsides of the eccentric come out to be VLD or PLD, D the equalizing point, L the center of the eccentric on this line, and the eccentric HO and FH.Let this hypothesis correspond to all positions of the planet observed at the moment of the planet's opposition to the sunâs mean position.For the present, I am postponing a more careful examination of whether this sort of hypothesis is in accord with physical principlesâa hypothesis, that is, in which the sun, through its motive mind paying attention to the earth, moves around the earth, and of itself (since it lacks an orb) drives itself forward nonuniformly according to its approach to or recession from the earth (unless you would make the earth more important than the sun and ascribe to the earth the sun's motive force); while this same sun (as in Copernicus) sends out a motive force to all the planets, sweeping them around itself with a degree of speed corresponding to their degree of nearness to the sun; the planets meanwhile striving to accomplish their approach to and recession from the sun on a small epicycle, and at the same time to follow the sun, wherever it is supposed to be, in those same tracks not proper to them; and thus any planet, and most of all the sun, attends to many things at once, and the actual trajectories of the planets through the aethereal air (as with Ptolemy) make spirals, such as were depicted in Ch.1.Whether, I say, these are fitting, we shall consider elsewhere when the occasion arises.Here, let this form of hypothesis be supposed true in its general features.The question is, whether it is also fitting, in particular, that the planets follow the sunâs body S, G, or whether they instead follow the point V, P, void of any body, four solar semidiameters (no more) from the center of the sun, which is now above the sun and now below, now before and now behind.And further, whether it is more fitting that the force that drives the planets in an orb around the sun make its nest in the body of the sun S, G, or in some other point such as VP void of body.In brief:  if the axle [axis] (to derive the sense of the word roughly from a wagon) of the planetary system, to which the orbs of the planets are fastened as with a nailâif this, I say, is near the sun, why not in the sun itself?If this axis or point of attachment travels around the earth both close to the sun and in the very same period, why does it describe its own peculiar path?Why does it not hold to the very same path as the sun?I therefore wholeheartedly conclude that if, perchance, Tycho Braheâs opinion on the world system be universally true, it must be accepted in such form that the center of the planetary system lies upon SG, exactly on the sunâs path, not upon VP; and finally, that it is in the sun itself, and that for liberating the first or eccentric inequality from the second, one should use the planetâs oppositions to the apparent position of the sun, not the mean.Brahe himself in his final days embraced this procedure unreservedly.Let us, then, see what is changed on the eccentric.Once again, as before, when the sun is on the line BC, as at G, and the planet is at F opposite point P, the planet F will be opposite the sun itself, G. Consequently, the sidereal position of the planet will appear to be the same,  along the line GF, whether the continuation of the line be CP or CG, because both have been made into one line.Therefore, according to either procedure, the planet is divested of the second inequality.But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), an appreciable difference arises.For let the sun have gone from G to S, let the line of the sunâs mean position CV be in Aries, and the planetâs line of vision CO be exactly opposite in Libra, so that VCO is one line.Since CS is beyond CV, the sun's apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.But, because of my alteration, the center of the planetary system is not at V but at S when the planet is seen along CO.Therefore, SO being connected, the earth C will lie outside the line SO, and hence, the planetâs apparent position on the line CO still is intermingled with the second inequality.Nor will CO be farther east at a later time, so as to be at opposition to CS.Instead, it will ascend toward CF, because the sunâs motion, and with it the motion of the center of the planetary system and of all its parts (and thus those of the planet O and of the center of the eccentric L), is from the line CO upward towards F, and is much faster than the motion of the eccentric or planet at O about L from the point H towards the bottom.Consequently, O is appreciably drawn back westward by a motion extraneous, not proper, to the eccentric; and indeed, it is well known that the planets are retrograde at opposition to the sun.Therefore, at a time preceding the moment designated by CV (let it be CT), when the sun appears on  line CQ, the planet will be seen at the point opposite its apparent position, at I. And now, since in the present case it is supposed to have shed the second inequality, QCI will be collinear; that is, the point whence the eccentricity arises will be on the line CQ.But CI, the retrograde planetâs line of vision, earlier in time, is beyond the later (and hence more westerly) line of vision CO.Therefore, CQ will also be beyond CV, and Q will be the systemâs new center, beyond the old, V. Moreover, the line IQ was made to be more distant from the line ÎV to the east by the angle OCI, while the line of apsides VD or PD (from which the motion begins) remains parallel to itself in the entire circuit.As a result, it appears to be established that the planet goes farther in a shorter period of time around the center Q of the system than it previously did in a greater period of time about the center V of the system.It thereby becomes apparent what is changed in the apparent eccentric motion by this restoration from the sunâs mean position to its apparent position.For when the center of the system is at G and the point opposite, the line of the apparent eccentric position remains unchanged, at Q it is moved forward, and opposite Q it is moved back, for at Q the time is diminished, and opposite Q it is increased.Also, these lines differ greatly from the original ones.Accordingly, when we repeatedly use a new operation, based upon these several apparent positions of the planet (opposite which we are supposing the center of the planetary system to be found; that is, in the sun itself), to investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality, the result of the operation differs greatly from the previous result.For we have just transposed the point of attachment from the circle VP, upon which Brahe had it move around, to the circle GS, that is, to the body of the sun.This new center always stands on a line parallel to CB, at a distance CB from the original Brahean point; for example, above V and P at S and G. Therefore with the point of equality D fixed (so that CV represents the same moment), in order for it to be possible both for the planet to be at O and for the point of attachment to be at S, a new line of apsides needs to be drawn through D and S or G. Consequently, according to the demonstrations of Ch.5 (which we have brought forward above, in explaining the Copernican form), with DS or DG drawn and divided at M in the ratio in which DP or DV are divided at L, let there be described about center M, with the same radius as before, a new eccentric.This will not only account for the later observations, upon which it was constructed, but, introduced into the prior hypothesis, it will also save the observations previously cited, with a precision of within five minutes.However, computations which are carried out upon the previous eccentric and this new one at positions other than night rising will in some places (particularly near the sunâs perigee) be able to differ by more than one degree, if we use numbers fitting and proper for Mars, which have been furnished by Brahe.There is no need to repeat the demonstration.The drawing is easiest in the Copernican diagram, if from the earth Î½ you set up a line parallel to Î²Îº, measure off upon it, at an interval Î²Îº above Î½, the center of the sun's eccentric, and upon this center set up the Brahean eccentric of the sun through k, and delete the Copernican center of the earthâs eccentric.The differences of the hypotheses, and their equivalence in the first inequalities but discrepancy in the second, have now been expounded.Let us then conclude the first part, which, as I see it, is the most difficult of the entire work, because of the almost inescapable labyrinths of opinion and the perpetual ambiguities of words and extremely tiresome circumlocutions.What necessity it was, however, that forced me to prefix this body of instruction, will now directly appear in Ch.7.Anyone who is less energetic can defer the whole part until he understands the easier parts.Chapter 60A method, using this physicalâthat is, authentic and perfectly trueâhypothesis, of constructing the two parts of the equation and the authentic distances, the simultaneous construction of both of which was hitherto impossible using the vicarious hypothesis.An argument using a false hypothesis.In Chapters 56, 58, and 59, the planet was assumed to approach the sun and recede from it along a diameter directed towards the sun, thus making an elliptical orbit, and further, it was assumed to spend time at each individual point in proportion to the distance of the point from the sun ^1.Thus we happen upon a most convenient short cut through the preceding Chapter 59, for evaluating the sum of any number of time intervals all at once.For it was shown that when a line is drawn from a circle perpendicular to the longer diameter of an ellipse inscribed in that circle (in the previous diagram, let KL be dropped to AC), so as to intersect the ellipse at M, and supposing that the sun is at N, the sum of all the distances of points on the arc AM from the sun N is contained in the area AKN.For an arc AM of the ellipse being supposed, which is defined by the arc of the circle AK, the area AHK is given, which is the sector of the arc AK, by which arc that sector is also measured, in units of which the whole area of the circle is 360Â°.And because the arc AK is given, its sine KL is also given.But as KL is to the whole sine EH, so is the area HKN to the area HEN, as was proved in Ch.40 ^2.Also, since the eccentricity HN is given, half of it multiplied by HE will describe the area HEN.This value is found at once at the beginning, so that it may be known what this small area amounts to, when the whole area of the circle has the value of 360Â° of time.And so, once the area HEN is known, it is very easy to find the area HKN by the rule of proportions.For as EH is to KL, so is NEH to the area NKH, or its value in  degrees, minutes, and seconds; and this, added to the value of KHA, establishes a value for KNA, which is the measure of the time which the planet takes on AM ^3.This, then, is one of the parts of the equation, the one I call \"physical\"a,  namely, the area HKN.Yet I so arrange the tables that there is no need to mention the equation, nor is there a separate column showing the opticalb  part of the equation, that is, the angle NKH.The [meanings of the] terms, \"mean anomaly,\" \"eccentric anomaly,\" and \"equated anomaly\" will be more personal to me.The mean anomalyc  is the time, arbitrarily designated, and its measure, the area AKN.The eccentric anomalyd  is the planet's path from apogee, that is, the arc of the ellipse AM, and the arc AK which defines it.The equated anomalye  is the apparent magnitude of the arc AK as if viewed from N, that is, the angle ANK.Now the angle of equated  anomaly is found as follows.The arc AK being given, the sine of its complement LH is given.And as the whole is to LH, so is the whole eccentricity to the part to be added4 to \n",

       " (subtracted, below 90Â°) to give the correct distance of Mars from the sun, namely, NM ^5.So in triangle MLN, the angle at L is right, and MN is given, and LN is also given.For it is made up of LH, the sine of the complement of AK, the distance from apogee, or the eccentric anomaly; and the eccentricity HN.Below 90Â°, in place of the sum LH, HN their difference should be taken, and in place of the complement of the eccentric anomaly, its excess.Therefore, the angle of equated anomaly LNM will not be hidden.Here anyone who wishes can easily figure out what has to be changed in the other semicircle.On the other hand, given the eccentricity and the equated anomaly, the  eccentric anomaly is given, a little more laboriously, whether we proceed demonstratively or by analysis ^6.It can be investigated demonstratively by this method: namely, by  measuring the angle under which is viewed the planet's incursion KM made from any point K on the circle as if seen from the center of the sun.This method depends upon several protheorems.I.The small lines of the planet's incursion towards the diameter of the apsides increase in proportion to the sines of the eccentric anomaly.For as EH is to KL, so is EB to KM.This was established in Chapter 59, and demonstrated in the Conics.IIThe ends of one of the small lines being connected to the center, and it being supposed that the small line remains the same in quantity at all points of the eccentric, the tangent of the angle at the center decreases approximately in proportion to the sines of the complement of the eccentric anomaly.Let DF be the small line, part of DV, the sine of the eccentric anomaly AD.Let the ends D, F be connected to H, and let HF be extended.And let the straight line ED be tangent to the circle at D, intersecting HF at E. Therefore, since DVH is right, VDH will be the complement of VHD, the eccentric anomaly.And since EDH is also right, HED will be less than a right angle by the quantity EHD.This is of hardly any significance, since where it is greatest it does not exceed 8 minutes.And for the same reason, VFH, that is, EFD, is greater than the complement FDH of the eccentric anomaly, but by the quantity FHD, which is clearly of no significance.And since FED is somewhat more acute than a right angle, the arc circumscribed about FED will be somewhat longer than a semicircle.Therefore, ED is to DF as the sine of an angle which somewhat exceeds the complement of the eccentric anomaly, is to the sine which is slightlyâreally, hardly at allâsmaller than the whole sine.Now if FD retains this length throughout the whole quadrant, ED is made approximately proportional to the sines of the complement of the eccentric anomaly.For if FD remains the same in length, and the end D is at A, the angle FDH is right, and thus FHD is a maximum, and then DFH is at its most acute, and consequently the arc above FD is at its longest.From that point, as FD moves down from A, the arc FED decreases and the angle FED increases, until at degree 90 FD becomes part of the line DH.Thus HF belongs to HD, and ED vanishes, and there, by analogy, the arc above FD is equal to the semicircle, and is at its least.IIIThe ends of the small line of the planet's incursion towards the diameter of the apsides being connected, however long the line happens to be at any eccentric anomaly, the tangents of the angles at the center (and thus the angles themselves as well, when they are at their smallest), increase approximately in the ratio compounded of the ratio of the sines and the ratio of the sines of the complements of the eccentric anomaly; that is, in proportion to the rectangles  on the quadrant formed by multiplying the sines of the angles by the sines of their complements.Thus, the greatest rectangle at 45 degrees is to the greatest angle at the same eccentric anomaly of 45Â° as the remaining rectangles are to the angles of the remaining eccentric anomalies.For at these angles, such as EHD, two factors are compounded: the length of the incursion, varying from nothing to a maximum, and its apparent magnitude, from nothing to a maximum.But, by I, the incursions increase in proportion to the sines, and by II, the tangents of the angles of apparent magnitude of these incursions, as if viewed from the center of the eccentric, decrease in proportion to the sines of the complement.By the former cause it happens that the angle is nothing at A when the sine is zero, and by the latter cause the angle is zero at an eccentric anomaly of 90,  when the sine of the complement is zero; and further, at both places the rectangle has vanished entirely.But at an anomaly of about 45Â°, FD has now turned out greater than half [its maximum], because the sine, \n",

Now, about center O, with radius OL, let an arc be described intersecting QO at N, and from N let a perpendicular NR be dropped to VO.Therefore, as PQ is to QO, so is RN to NO.But ML is equal to PQ.Therefore, as ML is to QO, so is RN to LO.Now ML is the sine of the angle LOM, under which the magnitude PQ or LM is observed from nearby, when LO, which is the shorter distance of the end L, is the whole sine.But QO is the longer distance of the magnitude ML, or of the end of PQ, namely, Q. And RN is the sine of the angle NOR, under which LM is observed, or the more remote line PQ, where NO, or LO, is again the whole sine.Therefore, as the sine of the apparent angle from nearby is to the longer distance, so is the sine of the apparent angle from afar to the shorter distance.And, permuted and converted, as the shorter distance is to the longer, so is the sine of the apparent magnitude from afar to the sine of the apparent magnitude from nearby.And in the present investigation, and universally as well, as the distance of Mars from the earth is to its distance from the sun, so is the sine of the latitude to the sine of the inclination of the planes.And, in turn, as the distance from the sun is to the distance from the earth, so is the inclination to the latitude.Q.E.D.Since these things are certain, and since the line designated by K appeared to be 5Â° 46Â¼â from E, multiplying the sine of this by the sine of EAK, and then dividing by the sine of AEK, results in the sine \n",

       ") Mars was not at the meridian.And the armillary spheres, by which the declination is measured elsewhere than at meridian, err more easily than the quadrants.Furthermore, a comparison with nearby dates, as in Ch.15, shows that the latitude was 0Â° 5' N., the same as we have computed.The ninth observation is not worthy of trust ^18.However, the accurately examined calculation for December 10 closely agrees with the Fabrician latitude19 of 3Â° 23', for it gives 3Â° 21ââ N. The tenth comes close to the calculation.The eleventh corresponds to a hair when refraction is excluded.The twelfth is barely two minutes greater than the calculation.I believe this is because there is that much uncertainty in my instruments.For in my quadrant of six cubits, two minutes are not easily discerned.We therefore have the acronychal latitudes determined accurately enough throughout the entire circumference of the circle, using this inclination of 1Â° 50' 30\".An examination of the remaining latitudes at observations at positions other than acronychal, of which there are many closely spaced examples in this book, I leave to more diligent scholars.Chapter 63Physical hypothesis of the latitude.It was said in Chapter 57 that if the diameter of the body or globe of Mars is  supposed to possess a magnetic force, and to be directed towards the middle elongations, and also to remain parallel to itself in that disposition throughout its entire circuit, the physical hypothesis of the eccentricity is complete.This supposition is all the more probable in that now the reason for the latitude too is explained using a closely related theory: that there be supposed some diameter of latitude in the body or globe of Mars that is directed towards the sidereal position of the limits, and remains parallel to itself in this disposition throughout its entire circuit.The ratio of this power to the former is that which [the power] of direction towards the pole in our magnets has to the force of attracting iron.That is, the former seeks the sun or flees it, while the latter, rather than seeking by sailing towards, or fleeing, those sidereal positions beneath which the limits of the latitude are reached, is only directed towards those positions, as a magnet towards the pole (for likewise, a magnet does not sail towards the polar region even if it floats freely) ^1.In fact, the excursion of the planet from the plane of the ecliptic to either side follows the direction towards which this axis of inclination, on the side that leads in the motion of its body, is pointed.Let CBAD be the ecliptic, A, C the nodes;B, D the limits.And let the axis of latitudes in the body of the planet be GNH, EAF, LOM, ICK.Now since we are supposing this axis to remain equidistant from itself throughout its circuit, it will happen that as the body moves from the ascending node C to the northern limit B, the axis IK of the body, which initially, at the node C, was tangent as it were to the imaginary circle of its circulation through CNAO, later intersects it at rightangles at the limits N, O, being directed towards the center of the world S, that is, towards the sun.But also, owing to a certain amount of declination from the royal road2 CBA, this axis had thus far been enticing the body of the planet to leave that path in the direction of N, towards which it had turned the preceding part K. Now, at the limits, although it has indeed remained inclined to the plane of the ecliptic CBS (for we have said that it remains equidistant from itself in all positions, and so once it is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic it will always be inclined), it nevertheless does not continue to decline from the royal road itself, that is, from the circumference of the plane of the ecliptic CBAD, once it is placed at GH.For it does not incline forward towards A, nor back towards C, but only to the side or towards the pole, places to which its path is not directed.So when the planet is moved forward beyond B, the other part of the axis, G, which inclines towards the south, is now in front, and it thus leads the planet from its greatest northern inclination N through the descending node A to the greatest southern inclination O.This axis of inclination is somewhat like an oar, in that just as boatmen use oars to move from one bank to the other, the planet brings this about through the inclination of the axis,  moving it from north to south and back, while the river, that is, the immaterial species of the sun, proceeds along the direct path CBAD.As for geometrical dimensions, there is no need for verbosity.A straight line moved on a rectilinear course while remaining parallel to itself creates a plane through its motion.This axis is itself a straight line, and it is moved in the direction it points (this pointing, moreover, presupposes a straight course).It therefore describes a plane.And if this plane be extended, it intersects the sphere of the fixed stars in the shape of a great circle, FEGH in the diagram of Chapter 13, because it intersects the plane of the ecliptic DC at the center of the world or the sun, A. To further convince yourself of this, you should consider that the points of intersection or nodes are in opposite positions about the center of the sun A, as you see in the diagram.This is shown by experience: see Ch.62.And so since there is a plane in which the orbit of Mars is moved about, its inclination to the plane of the ecliptic will follow a pattern.That is, when two equal circles are described, one, DC, in the plane of the ecliptic, and the other, FE, in the plane of Mars's orbit, about a common center A of the sun (i. e., on one and the same sphere of the fixed stars, concentric with the sun), the sine of the arc BD between the intersection of the circles and some point on Mars's circle, D say, is to the whole sine as the sine of the inclination DF of the point F is to the sine of CE, the greatest inclination, at the limit E. Furthermore, it was proved in Ch.13 above, using an ingenious treatment of the observations, that the declinations of all the points of the circuit from the plane of the ecliptic are arranged by the same measure.So no instance can be urged against our hypothesis.But there are still two difficult questions to be answered.One concerns how this declination of the axis originates, and the other concerns the axis itself.First, is the inclination of the axis natural or rational, the work of the body's nature or of an angel?And second, are the axis of inclination and the magnetic axis that seeks the sun the same?And if they are different, how do they exist in the same globular planetary body?The two questions are interrelated.I might almost have believed it to be natural, owing to the similarity between the natural power in the magnet and this one, were it not for the successive transposition of the nodes that had also been added, which clearly seems the work of a reasoning faculty, if not discursive, at least instinctual.For to maintain its equidistant position is less marvelous and more in accord with nature than previously in the matter of the eccentricity.There, we said that it is the sun that is sought by the axis of power, while here, it is the position beneath the far distant fixed stars.There, the axis was to have been turned about by the force of this magnetic power as the body is carried around, and would not remain equidistant to itself, if it were not restrained by a stronger directional force, or by an animate force, either unassisted or capable of reasoning in some manner.Here, the axis follows these equidistant positions by the force of our directional power itself, with no need of an animate power or of reasoning.Someone might, however, consider it the act of a mind, that the diameter that effects the latitude points directly towards the center of the sun when the planet is located at the limits, thus making a great circle of the  planet's orbit, and causing the nodes to be at opposite positions with respect to the sun.To this argument, in Ch.39 above, I affirmed that the planet moves with respect to the sun.However, it is not just any kind of relationship with the sun that argues for the assistance of reason.It is of course true that he who first ordained the heavenly motions so directed this axis as to point at the sun when at the appointed position, and did so deliberately and with perfect rationality.But this relationship with the sun can now be maintained without a mind, by the constancy of the magnetic faculty alone.For it is more like rest than motion, and hence is material, not mental.Therefore, it is only the variation of this inclination which we call the translation of the nodes over the ages that still makes a case for a motive force that is more than natural, or physical, as are magnetic powers.Nevertheless, I would prefer to think that the two must be conjoined, rather than to suppose that the rational faculty acts alone.Let the magnetic faculty be subordinate; let the rational be in charge, ruling over it, just as we said before in Chapter 57 concerning the power of seeking the sun.Once this question is settled, there follows the other.If this directive power arises from magnetic, physical, natural [powers], its substrate will be a body.Could it therefore happen that the same diameter that seeks the sun or flees from it also governs the planet's deviation from the ecliptic, by being inclined to it?If the nodes were connected to the apsides and the limits to the middle elongations then the diameter would be the same in all respects, administering both the eccentricity and the latitude.For it was said in Ch.57 that the diameter that causes the eccentricity is directed towards the middle elongations, while it was just now said that the diameter that causes the latitude is directed towards the limits.Therefore, if the limits were connected to the middle elongations, both diameters would have the same direction, and, their positions thus being in agreement, nothing would prevent their being identical.However, the nodes, or intersections with the true ecliptic, do not coincide with the apsides.For Mars, the northern limit is 12 degrees before the aphelion, for Jupiter, the northern limit and the aphelion coincide exactly, for Saturn, the node follows the aphelion by 24 degrees, and for the moon, owing to its short orbit, everything becomes interchanged with everything else.For now the node is at apogee, now at the middle elongations, now at perihelion [sic].So since these two powers differ in time and position, it follows that they are not identical.There is, however, nothing to impede their residing in one and the same planetary body as a whole, except the motion or rotation of the globe.Thus if the planets are moved like the moon, which does not rotate, but always shows us the same face, nothing prevents our saying that the two are interwoven, as  the weft is interwoven with the warp.For since the entire body of the planet would then stay in the same sidereal position as it is carried about the sun, any of its rectilinear parts, among which are numbered those two diameters, will stay in the same sidereal position.If, on the other hand, it is the earth's globe that is in question, which has a daily rotation in addition to its annual revolution, we are left in great doubt, no less than before, in Ch.57.For if the body rotates, only one single diameter of power, that which is parallel to the axis of its rotational motion, remains constant and equidistant from itself.So if you were to say that in addition to that diameter, there is interwoven with it another altogether different one, a power of another sort, which causes the latitude, it will observe the same direction as the axis of rotation, since it circumscribes a cone about that axis, successively traversing each of its parts, and since it inclines, now to the right, now to the left side, it finally leads the body towards the middle position, whither the axis of rotation points.Therefore, if the globe rotates, the subject of this declinational power is either not a body but something spiritual, or is not the same body.If it is something spiritual, how does it look to certain regions of the world, which are corporeal?And how does it impart this kind of motion (declination from the royal road) to the body?Is it perhaps that the body is more easily inclined, and departs from the royal road more easily (meanwhile receiving the cause of its translational motion extrinsically, from the sun), than it is carried from place to place by the force of its own proper mover?If, on the other hand, we prefer a corporeal subject, some mechanism will be brought into being for us, like those spherical oil lamps which, though thrown and spun around, do not spill any oil.For within is enclosed a little flask which, being drawn down by a weight in its belly,3 and held there, does not follow the convoluted motion of the surrounding sphere.Is there then also some interior globe within this globe of the earth, to which the diurnal motion of the earth's exterior does not penetrate, but which is held in place by a very strong inclination towards certain sidereal positions, so as not to follow the revolving exterior of the body?For as we shall see in Chapter 68, this question pertains to the earth as well.We shall also see there whether, if some mean ecliptic be proposed for the six planets, that which we were requiring a little earlier can be accomplished, namely, that the nodes of each of the planets correspond to the apsides.Or is it rather to be believed that there are some possible modes of celestial motion which, though physical like the magnetic [powers], cannot be comprehended by anyone on earth owing to the lack of examples?For if we had lacked the example of the magnet (which was indeed unknown at one time), we would have been ignorant of most of the causes of the celestial motions.Those who believe in solid orbs can easily set everything right, following what was said in Ch.13.For they will attribute to the plane of Mars's eccentric FE an inclination to the plane of the ecliptic DC that does not librate, but is fixed and constant, above the diameter BA of intersection of these planes, drawn through the center of the world (the center of the sun, for Brahe), and they will say that over the ages it rotates about the center A beneath the ecliptic DC.And since the poles (F, G and B, C in the present diagram) of two greatcircles (ML and KH) are distant by an amount equal to their maximum declination MK, LH, the poles of Mars B, C will therefore describe small circles about the poles of the ecliptic F, G, with radius FB, GC, of 1Â° 50' 25\".These people will also say that the poles of the Martian sphere B, C revolve forward with a motion quantitatively the same as that which was expressed above in Ch.17, and which will be corrected below in ch 69.Chapter 64Examination of the parallax of Mars through the latitudes.In Chapter 61, the two nodes were found to be at positions exactly opposed, a marvelous agreement and one which excludes all parallax.Let it be the case that Mars's parallax is at least 1' and 2' [respectively] when at opposition to the sun (and nearer to the earth than the sun\n",

       " and from the angle just found, let LCA be sought, which is found to be 160Â° 33'.Its supplement is 19Â° 27', to which corresponds the true distance of Mars L from the earth C.So now, using these angles of the operation, I find the apparent latitude LCB to be 6Â° 19' 10\", very nearly the same as the observed value ^12.Thus the hypothesis established in this work shows this very thing whose cause Brahe advised was diligently to be sought, and which ancient astronomy, for all its apparatus, cannot show.And, I would add, it shows this in all its simplicity, in that the plane of the eccentric is given a constant inclination or obliquity, and this is variously increased or diminished, not in reality, but optically only, insofar as our sighting approaches it or recedes from it, or (for Brahe and Ptolemy) it approaches or recedes from our sighting.Chapter 67From the positions of the nodes and the inclination of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic, it is demonstrated that the eccentricity of Mars takes its origin, not from the point of the sun's mean position (or, for Brahe, the center of the sun's epicycle), but from the very center of the sun.The end is a reply to the beginning.In Chapter 6, I argued on physical grounds that when solid orbs are denied, the eccentricities of the planets cannot take their origin from any point other than the very center of the sun.I postponed part of the geometrical proof of this, based upon the observations, to Chapters 22, 23, and 52, in which places I think I have satisfied even the sharpest- eyed critic.The other part I shall now expound.This is done first through the positions of the nodes.It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun.The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed?Not at all.Consider again the Copernican diagram in Chapter 6 ^1.In it let ÎºÎ´ now be the line of the limits, at 16Â¾Â° Leo and Aquarius (not, as in Ch.6, the line of apsides at 29Â° Leo).Therefore, the line [NN'] drawn through Îº perpendicular to ÎºÎ´ will be the diameter of the nodes.But if we use the mean sun instead of the apparent sun, then we are given Î² instead of Îº as the point from which the eccentricity is reckoned.So from Î² let Î²Ï be drawn perpendicular to ÎºÎ´ [and extended to PP'].This will fall at positions exactly opposite about Î², but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through Îº, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above Î²Ï by the distance ÎºÏ.It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point Îº is connected to the points of intersection of the line Î²Ï with the circumference of the eccentric.Since, by supposition, ÏÎº is at 16Â° 45' Leo, and Î²Îº is at about 5Â° 45' Cancer, the angle Î²ÎºÏ will be 41Â°; and since Î²ÏÎº is right, ÎºÎ²Ï will be 49Â°.And since ÎºÎ² is the sun's eccentricity, \n",

       " by maintaining this point, which has its own demonstration in Ch.52.It does not matter which way you do it.For both points have other demonstrations.The present way occurred to me first, and suited my purpose of showing how everything is in agreement.Chapter 68Whether the inclinations of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic are the same in our time and in Ptolemyâs.Also, on the latitudes of the ecliptic and the nonuniform circuit of the nodes.It was said in Chapter 14 that in any one period of Mars whatever, the obliquity</br>or inclination of Mars's plane to the plane of the ecliptic remains fixed.There</br>is, however, some doubt whether this obliquity is the same, and fixed, for all</br>ages.The reason for the doubt is this.In the first volume of the Progymnastica, p.233,1 Brahe demonstrated that  the latitudes of the fixed stars are different today than at the time of Ptolemy, the difference being this: that in the region of the summer solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars increased and those of the southern stars decreased; and, in turn, in the region of the winter solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars decreased and those of the southern stars increased.As one goes from these boundaries towards the equinox points, the alteration of the latitudes diminishes, until near the equinox points there is none at all.This observation of our time we shall accommodate to our principles laid down in Ch.63, thus:It is established that the sphere of the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars are not subject to any motion from place to place, and thus are truly fixed  forever in the same places.The ecliptic, in turn, is the great circle in the sphere of the fixed stars beneath which, for us on earth, the sun ever appears, and which it is seen to traverse annually.And whether this motion belongs to the sun or the earth, in either case it belongs to one of the planets.Therefore, the fixed stars do not themselves contain the cause of the ecliptic: it only results from the annual motion of the earth or of the sun about the center of the world.Thus, since the ecliptic is found to have changed its position with respect to  the fixed stars, it is not the fixed stars that have moved away from the ecliptic, but the latter that has moved away from the fixed stars.The reason for this translation is shown beyond doubt by our principles  of Chapter 63, if, indeed, they are sound.Since the sun, through its most rapid rotation in its space which, for Copernicus, is the center of the world, sets the planets in motion through an emitted species, this rotation will have determinate poles.In the last diagram of Chapter 63, let the body of the sun be IO, and the poles of rotation  be A, E, above which stand the points F, G on the sphere of the fixed stars.The great circle IO of the rotating solar body will thus be arranged beneath some great circle of the fixed stars: let this be ML.This is doubtless one and the same circle beneath the fixed stars, the poles F and G remaining constant, and the dignity of its body declaring that it first instils motion into the others.Nevertheless, the planets are found to move on various circles that are inclined to one another, owing to the natural principles explained in Chapter 63.Therefore, beyond doubt, the various circles of all the planets depend upon this \"royal circle\" ML, described by the rotation of the solar body about its axis AE, and each of them will keep its inclination to this circle constant in quantity, though having a translational motion, since we know by experience that the nodes are transposed.Since the ecliptic, too, is one of the planetary circles, either the sun's or the earth's, it is consistent for it, too, to have some inclination to the royal circle ML, described among the fixed stars by the great circle IO of the solar body.For what would be the reason why the other planets would decline from one another, while the ecliptic alone, standing above the solar or the terrestrial path, coincides exactly with this royal circle ML?Let this therefore be granted: that the ecliptic, properly so called, is inclined to the royal solar circle.Let it be represented to us by the circle KH drawn among the fixed stars, and let its poles be BC.Under these conditions, we easily discover the occasion of the alteration of the fixed stars' latitudes: as the name suggests, these are computed from the true ecliptic and not from that royal solar circle, hitherto unknown.For the intersections or common nodes of the ecliptic, truly and properly so called (as a result of eclipses' occurring only beneath that line along which the sun proceeds), with the circle ML, which we might call the \"mean ecliptic\", will be carried along no less than the nodes of the other planets.Nevertheless, the maximum obliquity MK or LH, which is measured by the distance of the poles FB, GC, remains fixed and constant, as in the  rest of the planets.That is, if about centers F, G, with constant radii FB, GC, small circles be described upon which we suppose the poles of the ecliptic B, C, to revolve, then the circle KH as well will depart from its original position on the sphere of the fixed stars FMG, and over the ages will make the southern limit come to be near the same fixed stars where the northern limit once was.Over a shorter period, however, it will be as follows.Since the limits K, H have not moved far from their fixed stars, their latitudes will be changed by some imperceptible quantity.However, since the nodes have progressed by the same amount from their fixed stars, the latitudes of their fixed stars will be altered more evidently.This is because at the end of the quadrant, near the limit, the sines of the inclinations increase by imperceptible increments, while at the beginning, near the nodes, these increments are quite perceptible.Hence, because no change in the latitudes of the fixed stars is perceived near the equinoxes, while it is noticeable enough near the solstices, we correctly conclude that the limits of the ecliptic's latitudes are near the equinoxes, and the nodes are near the solstices.Therefore, the points K, H will be near the equinoxes.We likewise  conclude this: that since the northern part of the true ecliptic flees from the north, in that the northern latitudes are increasing in Gemini and Cancer, the ecliptic's northern limit is therefore either in Libra, if the nodes progress, or in Aries, if (as is more probable) they retrogress.For the moon's nodes also retrogress, traversing the zodiac in 19 years, while the apogee progresses, traversing it in 8Â½ years.Now the sun's apogee, or the earth's perihelion, is at 5Â½Â° Cancer, and thus by Chapter 57, the diameter of power, causing the eccentricity, points at the sun when the earth is at 5Â½Â° Aries.But also, by Chapter 63, the diameter of power that causes the latitude points at the sun when the earth is at the limit, which is in Aries by the present Chapter 68.Therefore, by the same Chapter 63, both powers can be effected by the same diameter of the earth's body.Hence one may argue plausibly that this invisible circle or mean ecliptic and the true one known to us coincide at 5Â½Â° Cancer and Capricorn.If the aphelia of all the planets were arranged on a single great circle, we  could say that this is what we are seeking.For then it could be true of all planets, as it is here in the earth's circuits, that the nodes coincide with the apsides, and thus both variationsâthat of the eccentricity (in height) and that of the the obliquity (in latitude)âare effected by the same diameter of power.This would free us from the great difficulties with which we were left in Chapter 63.And in fact the apogees of the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn fit approximately.For the aphelia of all three superior planets are in the same semicircle, and at the same time in the same northern direction.Therefore, the southern limit of the true ecliptic would be in Libra, and the northern in Aries, which agrees with the above.A full consideration of this question must, however, be deferred until the motions of all the planets are examined with reference to the true ecliptic, the one known to us.Further confirmation of this opinion of a hidden royal circle, projected  from the sun among the fixed stars, is provided by the obliquity of the ecliptic that is in common use, which is computed from the equator, but which we  might more correctly call the equator's latitude from the ecliptic.Now the  equator is the great circle of the earth's body that is intermediate between the poles of the earth's daily rotation on its axis.And the same name of \"equator\" or \"equinoctial\" is given to that region of the sphere of the fixed stars that stands above the terrestrial equator in any era.The same name of \"poles\" is given to the points of the fixed stars that stand above the earth's poles in any era.Hence this axis, and this great circle, are inclined to the ecliptic differently in different eras.For to the extent that the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Cancer, and the southern latitude in Capricorn, is greater today, the equator's latitude from the ecliptic is smaller than it was once, since this obliquity is greatest in Cancer and Capricorn.It was once 23Â° 51Â½â, while today it is 23Â° 31Â½â, the difference of 20' being the change in latitude of the fixed stars.It is, however, reasonable to suppose that the circle of the equator with its axis and poles would forever decline from the poles of this ecliptic HK by an equal and fixed distance, if the true ecliptic were the world's primary circle.But the ecliptic has changed, and the inclination of this axis to the ecliptic (and with it the inclination of the equator, to which this axis belongs) has been altered, so that to the extent that the ecliptic has receded from the fixed stars in Cancer, it has approached the equator.Therefore, the equator appears to maintain a constant inclination to some other circle.So a great cause, and a great dignity, ought to belong to this hidden circle.And thus from all these plausible arguments there arises a royal circle LOM, middle among the circles of the planets, to which all the planets, and Mars with them, maintain a constant inclination.The example of the moon should not trouble us, whose inclination to the ecliptic, but not to any other great circle, is a constant 5Â°, both in the past and today, even though the ecliptic has been moved.For there is an enormous difference between the moon and the other planets.The orbs of the others encircle the center of the world.The moon's orb alone (roughly speaking) is outside the center and is transported from place to place.The others in common circle the sun, while the moon circles the earth.The eccentricities of the others and the whole theory of longitude and latitude originate from the sun, while those of the moon originate from the moving earth.The sun sweeps the others around in a circle, while the earth so moves the moon.What wonder, then, if the moon keeps the limits of its latitude constant with respect to the changeable ecliptic HK, beneath which lies the terrestrial circle, while the other planets do so with respect to some other invariable circle, such as LOIM?So the moon should not prevent us from giving credence to this theory.It is therefore granted that Mars's orbit is inclined at a constant angle to some circle that maintains its position beneath the same fixed stars, such as  LOIM.It follows that this same orbit of Mars has different inclinations to the ecliptic HK in different ages, since in certain of its parts it leaves the fixed stars it originally lay beneath and moves on to others.This only follows, however, if we grant that the nodes of Mars and the nodes of the earth, that is, the intersections of these orbits with the invisible circle LOIM, are not always carried over the same intervals in the heavens, some being faster than others.An authentic example of this was just given.For since the equator maintains a constant inclination to this invisible circle LOIM, while the ecliptic is meanwhile moved, the declination of the equator from the ecliptic is consequently perceived to be changeable.Let A be the pole of the mean ecliptic, or the point upon which the straight line falls that is drawn from the center of the sun through the pole of the solar body.About center A with radius AB of 23Â° 42' (or thereabouts) let a smaller circle be described, and let B, C be the positions of the north pole of the world, or the points upon which falls a line from the center of the earth's body through the pole of the daily rotation on the same body, B at the time of Ptolemy, and C at our time.If the nodes of the ecliptic also retrogress, the northern limit must be placed near the fixed stars in the region of Aries and Pisces.For the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Gemini and Cancer has increased, as was previously said.Let the midpoint D between B and C be taken, marking the position of the pole of the equator at an intermediate time, and let AD be joined.Thus the circle AD extended will pass through the solstice of the intermediate time.From A at right angles to AD let AE be drawn, which, being  extended, will pass through the vernal equinox of the intermediate time.Therefore, close to the line AE there would be the pole of the circle beneath which the orbit and circuit of the earth was once arranged.And because the northern limit is in Aries, let EA be extended in the direction of A, and let the point I be taken on the extension below A. Thus the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic would be at I. About center A with radius AI let a small circle be described, on which let another point O be taken, nearer to C than I is to B. And let O be the present pole of the ecliptic, 23Â° 31Â½â from C, while I, the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic, is 23Â° 51Â½â from B. This will be the theory of the ecliptic's altered obliquity and of the altered latitude of the fixed stars, except that the size of the small circle OI is not known to us.For the ecliptic's 20' alteration of obliquity can be produced in various ways.And because O is today's pole of the ecliptic, and OC points towards the beginning of Cancer, let CP be the eighth part of the circle, and P the middle of Leo, where the northern limit of Mars is today.Let PO be extended beyond O, and let GI be drawn through I nearly parallel to PO, but slanting somewhat forward in longitude (for the sidereal position of Mars's limit was once a little farther forward than today), and let it be extended beyond I. And about A let a small circle be described, intersecting PO at F and GI at H. Let the size of the circle be sufficient to make OF greater than IH.And let the pole of the circle beneath which the circuit of Mars is arranged, be placed at F today, and at H in the past.Todayâs obliquity OF, or the inclination of the plane of Mars to the ecliptic, will be greater, and the Ptolemaic obliquity HI will be smaller.Nevertheless the pole of Marsâs orbit H, F would have moved from H to F keeping at a constant distance AH, AF from A.</br>And since the pole of the Martian orbit has traversed a fairly large arc from H to F, whether forward or backward, but at the same time the pole of the ecliptic has gone from I to O about the same point A, the pole of Mars would appear to be nearly at rest, since IH and OF are nearly parallel.A great inequality in the motion of the nodes must indeed follow if it is true  that the poles of the individual planets circle some common pole in different times.For there is an anomaly originating from this source in the precession of  the equinoxes, whose treatment is very much like the present ones.I have stated what is in agreement with the principles established in this work, and by what hypotheses this can be brought about, so that the inclinations of the planes can be made different in different ages.Let us now examine the observations of Ptolemy.For since the northern latitude of Mars is with Cor Leonis, a northern star, while the southern latitude is with the southern stars of Capricorn, it is reasonable that the same happened to Mars's maximum latitudes as happened to those stars: they both increased.For the stars' latitudes did increase, the northern ones around the summer solstice, and the southern ones around the winter solstice.Ptolemy therefore said that Mars's maximum observed northern latitude was 4Â° 20', while today it is 4Â° 32' ^2.This confirms our opinion, since he shows a maximum latitude that is 12' smaller than today's, while the nodes stayed at approximately the same distance from aphelion as they are today.On the other hand, he makes the southern latitude about 7Â°, while today it could also be that much, namely, 6Â° 52ââ.We are therefore left undecided by his observations.For concerning those 12' in the northern latitude, it should be noted that the smallest graduations on his instruments were 10 minutes, and that he usually supposed an error amounting to one of these parts.Also, the difference between the Greek symbols for 20' and 40' is very small and slippery, often neglected by translators ^3.Nevertheless, the Arabic says 20' here.There is nothing besides this in Ptolemy that can lead us to a judgement of how these matters stood in antiquity.For the observation examined in the following Chapter 69 is shown to be in error.Therefore, as long as we are wanting suitable observations from antiquity, circumstances compel us to leave this discussion of the motion of the nodes, along with many other matters, to posterity, if, indeed, it should please God to vouchsafe the human race a length of time in this world sufficient to work through such remaining questions thoroughly.Chapter 69A consideration of three Ptolemaic observations, and the correction of the mean motion and of the motion of the aphelion and nodes.1From all antiquity, there have survived no more than five written observations of the star Mars, as well as one of extreme antiquity noted by Aristotle, who saw Mars occulted by the dark part of the half moon.However, neither the year nor the time of day were given.Nevertheless, I have discovered, using a very lengthy process of induction extending over the 50 years from Aristotle's fifteenth year to the end of his life, that this could not have happened on any other day than \n",

       ", 272 BC, when Mars occulted the northern star in the head of Scorpius ^3.Here again, no particular time was given.The other four were by Ptolemy himself, using an astrolabe to measure Mars's distance from fixed stars.However, he reports only the zodiacal position at the exact moment of Mars's opposition to the sun's mean motion ^4.Upon these few observations, arguments of the greatest moment are to be founded; or, if this is not possible, astronomy must remain incomplete.First, through the four Ptolemaic observations, the epoch of the mean motions, related to the fixed stars, belonging to Ptolemy's time, is to be found, and by a comparison of this with the modern data the mean motion itself is to be determined.Next, it seems possible to use the Chaldean observation to inquire whether the solar eccentricity was really once greater than it is today.And then, using both this observation and the Aristotelian one, if the time were known, one could hazard a guess at Mars's latitude at those times.But by God immortal, what is this path upon which we shall be treading?For we have hardly anything from Ptolemy that we could not with good reason call into question prior to its becoming of use to us in arriving at the requisite degree of accuracy.IFirst, at the times set out, he records the mean position of the sun by a calculation that depends upon observation of the equinoxes and solstices.The sun reveals the beginning of Aries, not by pointing a finger at the place, but by a blind conjecture of the time.For we call the beginning of Aries that point that the sun occupies when the day is observed to equal the nights.What if Ptolemy had been in error as to the time?We are not wanting conjectures.First, he does not give his method of observing it.My hope is that he observed the meridian altitudes, for by induction from these the moment of the sun's entering the northern hemisphere is obtained without error.But what if he had observed it using Alexandrian armillaries, where refraction could have put him off?He himself clearly suggests that he did so, when he says that the equinox was measured twice on the same day using these armillaries.He ascribes this to instrumental error; I, however, suspect that the error arose from refraction ^5.Let it stand, however: let him have observed it through meridian altitudes.There is another suspicion that unwelcomely but most forcefully insinuates itself: the moments of the equinoxes recorded by Ptolemy do not agree within a day and a half when compared with the previous observations of Hipparchus and the later ones of Albategnius6 and Brahe, all of which conspire in a single equality.The Ptolemaic equinoxes alone deviate.This fact has given rise to many extremely complicated opinions on the heavens, and gave birth to the motions of trepidation and libration, all of which are brought to ruin once one sees that the observations after Ptolemy always agree to the point of equality with the most ancient ones of Hipparchus.Ptolemy nevertheless supports himself by comparing the vernal equinoxes with the autumnal.For if, as a result of instrumental error, he had pronounced the true equinox to be on the following day, when it had occurred on the  previous one, the autumnal equinox would have been pronounced to be on the previous day when it belonged on the following one.If two days were thus subtracted from the length of the summer, a great alteration in the sun's eccentricity would have resulted.Nevertheless, following his observations, he left this at the same quantity found by Hipparchus.So no alternative is left us but to trust Ptolemy in believing him to have observed correctly the time at which the sun stood at the beginning of Aries.IIOnce a beginning is made, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is found through  observation, it is a trivial matter to use the sun's declinations on each day to report its elongation from the point occupied by the sun at the time stated to be the moment of the equinox, whatever it might be or in whichever sphere it might be established.For various authors thought up a variety of spheres for this purpose: after the eighth and ninth spheres established by Ptolemy,  others have set up a tenth, and most recent authors an eleventh and a twelfth, all through the merest of speculations, against which overabundance of mechanisms7 Brahe vehemently inveighed.He never, however, told me what he intended to substitute in their place, nor did he leave it in writing anywhere.Copernicus, on the other hand, acted ingeniously and wittily (in the common  opinion), and wisely (in mine), in removing his eyes from the heavens and seeking that point in the globe of the earth, above which, in the sphere of the fixed stars, there stands a point, determinate for any age you please, as was said in Ch.68.However, this is not the place to discuss this matter further.IIIThere follows a demonstration of the equation, which depends upon the sun's  observed entry into the beginnings of the cardinal signs.For when the equation is subtracted from or added to the sun's apparent position, the sun's mean motion is established with respect to the point which the sun is observed to occupy at the time of the equinox.Here too, as to the quantity of the equation, there is greater uncertainty than before over the equinox or the beginning of the zodiac.For today that equation appears to be 20' less than the quantity which Hipparchus appears to have demonstrated for himself, and which Ptolemy retained.Nor is there sufficiently good reason why we should say that the ratio of the orbs is different today from what it once was.For affirmations of the greatest moment require the most solid evidence, and this we are lacking.And those observations cannot be that accurate, especially concerning the entry into Cancer and Capricorn.If we substitute the modern equations for Ptolemy's, we shall not change his observations as much as Ptolemy himself says he can discern in observing, nor as much as the Ptolemaic observations can be vitiated by the matter of refraction.For we can with  certainty name the day of the Ptolemaic equinox observation, though meanwhile remaining uncertain about the time of day.And here, the partnership of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes is no such defense against the small error we are considering here as it was before against a large one.That the equations of Ptolemy's day were really equal to ours, the constancy of the modern ones argues.For those found today by Brahe, and those found several centuries ago by Albategnius and Arzachel,8 are nearly the same.There is therefore suspicion that the equation of the sun used by Ptolemy is in error, since it is deduced from erroneous apparent positions of the sun.Consequently, Ptolemy did not relate Mars to either the sun's mean or its apparent position, without the chance of error.Nevertheless, there is this consolation, that we need to make use of the sun's apparent position, the comprehensive argument for which was given above.We can, however, proceed on a twofold path: either we believe Ptolemy on the equinoxes, or, using the modern equations, we apply a correction to the Ptolemaic equinoxes, making the vernal equinox three hours later than that noted by Ptolemy, and the autumnal earlier by the same amount, the result being an error of 8' in the sun's declination at each place.Ptolemy's instruments were doubtless not calibrated with divisions any finer than 10'.And Hipparchus assigns an uncertainty of one such division.For this reason, the times, too, that the sun takes to traverse the quadrants of the zodiac, were not expressed more precisely than to within a quarter of a day.So much for the true length of summer and winter.IVBut what shall we now say of the sun's entry into Cancer and Capricorn, upon which the apogee and the setting out of the equations depends?And of how easily a quarter of a day can diminish the vernal quadrant of the zodiac, and increase the autumnal?For the sun's entry into Cancer is quite imperceptible.Nor can I be persuaded that Hipparchus and Ptolemy examined the very moment of this entry, ignoring the intermediate points.I find it more credible that throughout the summer they were carefully noting the sun's declinations, and were matching up the equal ones on both sides of the solstice, taking as the true entry of the sun into Cancer the time intermediate between the moments of equal declinations.In this way, if a comparison had been made of positions near to the solstice, there would indeed be little error, but there still could have occurred as much as a quarter of a day, during which time 15' of the sun's motion elapse.Therefore, even if the equinoxes were perfectly certain, it is nonetheless possible that there be an excess or defect of a quarter of a degree in the sun's position in the two segments about the solstice, and that the apogee should then fall eight degrees farther forward or farther back.So much for the sun's motion.VNow, as for the observations of Mars itself, even if Ptolemy in fact managed to line the astrolabe up accurately on the fixed stars, there is still clearly no more certainty about Mars's zodiacal position (just as in the previous consideration of the sun's position) than there is about the positions of our fixed stars.If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars.Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error.For consider both the manner in which it is found and the argument of error.In the year 2 of Antonine Ptolemy sought it through the half-illuminated moon ^9.Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon.Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*.Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed.For the measurement was made at sunset.But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree.Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial.Thus it appears that half a degree must be added to the positions of the fixed stars at the time of Ptolemy.Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition.So when these four observed positions of Mars are presented by Ptolemy: 21Â° 0' Gemini, 28Â° 50' Leo, 2Â° 34' Sagittarius, 1Â° 36' Sagittarius; we should take these: 21Â° 30' Gemini, 29Â° 20' Leo, 3Â° 4' Sagittarius, 2Â° 6' Sagittarius.Now Ptolemy actually defended himself against such presumption, affirming that he frequently had sought out this one thing, namely, the elongation of the fixed stars from the moon, of the  moon from the sun, and hence the distance of the fixed stars from the sun and from the equinox point, and had always found it to be the same.So although he produced only one observation in order to demonstrate the method, it is nonetheless credible that he consulted several observations, at both the rising and the setting of the sun or moon, finally choosing the one which he saw to be intermediate among many operations that produced various positions.Now this argument over 30' seems to be irrelevant to Mars's mean  motion, if indeed on these four occasions Mars, as it was observed with respect to the fixed stars, can be referred to them, without consideration of the equinox point, whose distance is uncertain.This is the method I used in Ch.17 above to investigate the position of the aphelion in Ptolemy's times.We are nevertheless hindered in this respect, that the observed positions of Mars are to be referred to a point opposite the sun's apparent position.This task can never proceed correctly unless the distances of both Mars and the sun from the common equinox point is previously known, since the arc of the true elongations of Mars from the sun cannot be deduced otherwise than through these components (so to speak).If, at the moment taken as the true opposition of the bodies, the planet should appear to be 30' beyond the sun's true positions, the planet still has some involvement with the second inequality, and is not yet ready for an enquiry into the first inequality.And at apogee, these 30' in the equation of the orb occupy a large arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even larger portion of the time or the mean motion.At perigee the opposite takes place.For this equation of the center occupies a small arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even smaller portion of the mean motion.Therefore, anyone who says that on these four occasions Mars was observed 30' farther along on the zodiac, says in effect that at the equinoctial point Mars's mean motion was many minutes farther back at apogee, and a few minutes back at perigee.And since the arc on the eccentric is smaller than this 30' arc resulting from faulty observation, neither Mars's eccentric position nor even its sidereal position are as far forward as Mars itself appears to have moved with respect to the fixed stars, the difference being that quantity by which the arc on the eccentric differs from the 30' arc in the observation.And since this arc is large at aphelion, differing but little from the 30' arc in the observation, and the  opposite at perigee, it therefore finally will follow that at aphelion a small amount, and at perihelion more, must be subtracted from Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars, if we accept that the fixed stars are 30' farther forward on the zodiac.Thus not only is the mean motion made smaller (although by a much smaller quantity than the 30' resulting from faulty observation), but also the arrangement of the three acronychal observations used by Ptolemy is disturbed, whence must arise another aphelion and another eccentricity.However, this will cause us no trouble later.For we may neglect it, even if the observations introduce something large, as long as there is no suspicion of error in the fixed stars, since it is certain that they do not have the same precision as the Brahean ones.So we shall use the form of equation found through the Brahean observations, as if they remain the same throughout the ages.Since we have encountered three forks in the road, one concerning the sun's eccentricity, another concerning the position of the sun's apogee, and the third concerning the zodiacal positions of the fixed stars and of Mars, there are therefore eight ways of establishing the mean motions and the aphelion at the moments of observation, even if, ignoring the zodiac, we compute only with reference to the fixed stars.Let the first investigation retain all the Ptolemaic data concerning the sun and the fixed stars.Since the positions of the sun's mean motion were 21Â° 0' Sagittarius, 28Â° 50' Aquarius, and 2Â° 34' Gemini, and the sun's apogee was 5Â° 30' Gemini, the apparent positions of the sun were 21Â° 40' Sagittarius, 1Â° 13' Pisces, and 2Â° 41' Gemini, all three beyond opposition ^10.The true opposition therefore precede them.And since the diurnal motion at 21Â° Gemini (Cancer, today) is about 23', and that of the sun, 61', and the sum is 1Â° 24', those 41' therefore require 8 hours,11 at which time Mars was visible at 21Â° 8' Gemini, opposite the sun's apparent position.Likewise, at 29Â° Leo (Virgo, today) Mars's diurnal motion is usually taken to be 24', the sun's diurnal motion 59', and the sum 1Â° 23'.Therefore, a difference of 2Â° 23' requires 1 day 17 hours 21 minutes, at which time Mars was visible at 29Â° 31' Leo.Finally, at 3Â° Gemini (Cancer, today) Mars's diurnal motion is 23', the sun's 57', the sum 1Â° 20', by which it is shown that for 7' there are required \n",

       " at which time Mars was visible at 2Â° 36' Sagittarius.12 13 14To the first interval there corresponds a mean sidereal motion of 80Â° 57' 14\" beyond the complete cycles, and to the second, 96Â° 16' 24\".But in the former instance the apparent motion of Mars was 68Â° 21' 20\" beyond the complete cycles, with precession over the interval subtracted, in the amount that it was at that time ^15.In the latter instance, the apparent motion was 93Â° 2' 20\".Now let the hypothesis previously under investigation, established on the basis of the most recent observations, be brought in, and let the question be raised, at what anomalistic position do the apparent motions on the eccentric correspond to the mean motions, as I have just now given them?After a few  trials, this is found: If for the last time the aphelion of Mars is placed at 0Â° 41' Leo, and for the remaining times somewhat before that, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, while at the first time the mean anomaly is 46Â° 37', at the second, 34Â° 21', and the third, 130Â° 37Â½â; and thus the elongation from the equinox at the middle time was 5s 4Â° 59' 20\", then by the modern hypothesis of the equations the star Mars is placed at 21Â° 7' Gemini for the first time, 29Â° [31']16 Leo for the second, and 2Â° 37Â½' Sagittarius for the third, fortuitously precise.For the foundations are not such as to allow one to hope for such precision.Had Ptolemy made note of more oppositions of his day, we would doubtless be experiencing greater difficulty.For with three solar oppositions it is handled easily ^17.Compare this aphelion with Ch.17.Second, the Ptolemaic equation and apogee being retained, let 30 minutes be added to the fixed stars.The result will be slightly different.For since Mars is half a degree beyond opposition to the sun, the corrected opposition will follow.The sums of the diurnal motions were 1Â° 24', 1Â° 23', and 1Â° 20'.Therefore, for the extra 30' the corresponding times come out almost exactly the same, to be added to all three, namely, about 8 hours 40 minutes.To this there corresponds 8Â½â of Mars's apparent motion, which is to be subtracted from these 30'.The remaining 21Â½â are to be added to the planet's positions, placing it at 21Â° 29Â½â Gemini, 29Â° 52Â½â Leo, and 2Â° 57Â½' Sagittarius.The intervals both of time and of zodiacal positions will remain almost exactly the same.Thus the distribution of the mean anomaly among these observations, which was just now found, will also be the same.Only the aphelion will be transposed by the same number of minutes, so that on the last date it is at 1Â° 2Â½â Leo.It therefore has to be moved 8Â½â back among the fixed stars.And the mean motion from the equinox will be increased by the above mentioned 21Â½â, but it will be 8 hours 40 minutes longer.And to these hours there correspond 11' 24\" of mean motion.Therefore, at the proposed time, the mean motion from the equinox will be only 10' greater than before.But the positions of the fixed stars are 30' farther removed from the equinox.Therefore, Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars has proceeded 20' less than before.Third, the sun's apogee being transposed by 11 or 12 degrees,18 while the longitude and equation of the fixed stars remains the same.Then on the first date the sun will be 20' back in position;19 on the middle date practically nothing will be changed; and on the last date it will be 21â farther along in position, owing to the altered equations of the sun.Therefore, the first opposition will be 4 hours later,20 and Mars will be the same number of minutes farther back in position, while the last opposition will occur 4â hours earlier,21 with Mars the same number of minutes farther along in position.22 23The first interval of time becomes smaller.So also the corresponding mean  motion is 5' 15\" smaller, so as to be 80Â° 53'.The second interval of time again becomes smaller.Therefore, the mean motion corresponding to it is 5' 40\" smaller, namely, 96Â° 10' 48\".So, since to the two mean motions, both smaller, there corresponds a greater apparent motion than before, and on the supposition that the mean anomaly is the same as before for both, the apparent motion is greater by about 9', it therefore appears that Mars has to move down from aphelion.However, the first interval is unchanged unless a great descent is made, while the second [is corrected] by a descent of about 36â ^24.Therefore, if we were to indulge in our enquiry, and not take the modern hypothesis as given, we would arrive at a completely different hypothesis with a new eccentricity ^25.And if, on the other hand, these three observations of Ptolemy were perfectly certain, this would constitute the basis for an argument that he established the sun's apogee correctly.But when 36' are subtracted from Mars's aphelion, placing it at 0Â° 3' Leo26 for the last time, and when its mean motion is so adjusted that for the middle time the [mean] anomaly is 34Â° 58Â½â with longitude from the equinoctial of 5s 5Â° 0' 50\", the following observations result:27Again, an accurate enough approach.For we cannot hope that the observations were of such certainty.So, whether the sun's apogee is known correctly or not, the distance of the mean motion from the equinoctial is certain within 1Â½â.Fourth, the same things will be changed in the computed positions of the second case, and in establishing the mean longitude, that is, by transposing the apogee and the fixed stars ^28.Fifth, the sun's apogee and the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars remaining the same, the modern solar eccentricity is used.Thus, while the first and last positions of the sun remain almost exactly the same, the sun's apparent position will be changed in the middle observation by 20'.For the former fall near the sun's apsides, where the equation is small, while the latter is near the middle longitude, where the equation caused by the eccentricity is maximum.And since in Aquarius the equation is additive, when 20' are taken away from the equation, the sun will be moved back through the same number of minutes, and will be, not in 29Â° 31' Aquarius, but in 29Â° 11' Aquarius.The correct and truest opposition therefore follows by 4 hours ^29.The planet will then be at 29Â° 27' Leo ^30.The earlier time interval and its mean motion is increased, and the apparent motion is decreased, while the later time interval is decreased, and the apparent motion is increased.So once again, more evidently than before, the application of this correction calls upon us to change the hypothesis, unless we had sworn allegiance to the words and numbers of the hypothesis of this era by our best judgement.For to move the planet forward a smaller distance in a greater time near apogee, and a greater distance in a smaller time near perigee, nothing can suffice but to increase the  eccentricity.If everything were kept the same, as in the first case, the results for the first and third times would indeed again be the same as then, namely 21Â° 7' Gemini and 2Â° 37Â½' Sagittarius.But in the middle position, it would come out to be 29Â° 36Â½â Leo, where it ought to have been 29Â° 27' Leo, a difference of 9Â½' ^31.To eliminate this, the aphelion ought to remain in about the same place, but the mean motion should omit 3Â½â.Then the results will be:32Sixth, the same change of the second case will occur, if we at once change both the sun's eccentricity and the longitude of the fixed stars.Seventh, if on the other hand we at once change both the eccentricity and apogee of the sun, combining the third and fifth cases, the fundamentals will be these ^33.34The first interval remains the same as in the first case, while the last is much altered.And because more of the path is traversed in a smaller time, it must descend farther down towards perigee.To 8 hours of mean motion correspond 10' 30\", to which add the extra 8 minutes of travel ^35.The total is thus 18Â½ , which we shall make up if we move the aphelion back by 1Â° 12', putting it at 29Â° 29' Cancer for the last time, with a mean anomaly of 131Â° 45' ^36.Therefore, [the position of] its mean motion is 11Â° 4â Sagittarius,37 which, in the first case, was 11Â° 18Â½â Sagittarius.From this we compute:38Finally, with alterations in all three data that we have taken from Ptolemy, the result will be the combined effect of the seventh and second cases.It is therefore apparent that the epoch of the mean motion with respect to the equinox and the fixed stars is not much changed by an alteration in the sun's eccentricity, or in the apogee, or in both at once, but that it is only changed when the positions of the fixed stars are altered.For the third case adds 1' 30\", the fifth subtracts 3' 30\", and the seventh subtracts 4â 30\".The second case alone subtracts 10â39 from the mean motion measured from the equinoctial, and 20' measured from the fixed stars ^40.As a result of this, two epochs of motion at the time of Ptolemy are  established.But what if we make something suitable by combining the second and  fifth cases, by which we can hold simply to the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars, eliminating any need for us to suspect that there might be two epochs of Mars's mean motion?For Ptolemy explicitly affirms that in his observation he found the moon's distance from the sun to be 92Â° 8â, the same amount he computed from his hypothesis of the moon's motions.Ptolemy would have spoken truly: he would have been skillful enough in observing, and would have plainly seen this distance on his instrument to be the same as that prescribed by his hypothesis of the moon's motions, which was not in error near the quadratures.From this, I argue thus.If the sun had been at 3Â° 5' Pisces,41 where Ptolemy placed it using his eccentricity, the moon could not have appeared 92Â° 8' from it, the measure that is just and computed from the hypothesis, for the reason that the setting sun reaches the eye by refraction, and appears higher than it actually is (and thus 30â farther to the east).But because the arc from the moon to the sun was observed to be 92Â° 8â, and because of refraction, this was in actual fact 92Â° 38â, the sun was therefore not at 3Â° 3' Pisces, but at 2Â° 33' Pisces.And this is in agreement with the fifth case, where we said that Ptolemy's maximum additive equation (which occurs at 5Â° Pisces) becomes 20' smaller when today's eccentricity is used, thus putting the sun at 2Â° 43' Pisces instead of 3Â° 3' Pisces.And so, on the supposition that refraction is universal throughout all places and times, as is discussed in the Optics,42 and supposing this observation to stand, we arrive at the conclusion that the sun's eccentricity is less than that reckoned by Ptolemy.It should not trouble you that I spoke of a refraction of 30', while this diminution is but 20'.For if you consider well, since 30Â° Taurus had culminated, 1Â° Pisces was then setting at Alexandria, and the sun, being at 3Â° Pisces, consequently had an altitude of two degrees, or perhaps even more, and therefore the refraction was less than 30'; nor was all the refraction simply longitudinal.Thus these two causes43 were almost exactly the same in quantity, and cancelled one another.However, anyone who knows anything of the Ptolemaic reckoning of the fixed stars will not consider this difference of ten minutes worth mentioning.For example, Ptolemy comes up with an interval of 54Â° 10' between Cor Leonis and Spica Virginis, although in the heavens themselves it is not more than 53Â° 59'.Let us therefore follow whither our inclinations and our arguments lead: as in the first case, in the second year of Antonine, on the 12th day of Epiphi, \n",

and this while the hypothesis remains valid which the modern Brahean observations have generated.For Brahe places the northernmost star at 29Â° 3Â½â Scorpio.Subtract Cor Leonis at 24Â° 17' Leo.The difference will be its elongation from Cor, 94Â° 46Â½â.But our calculation puts Mars at an elongation of 94Â° 49Â½' or 94Â° 51Â½' from Cor Leonis ^16.The difference is 3 or 5 minutes, not greater.I do not deny that the latitude presents a difficulty for me, in that I  interpret the words, á¼Î´ÏÎºÎµÎ¹ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎµÎ¸ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ­Î½Î±Î¹, as if he said, \"It appeared to approach so near that the two stars could be taken as if they were one, that they appeared to touch one another.\"The Arabic, however, translates it [with a word signifying] \"to have covered up,\" as if the Greek had read, á¼ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎµÎ¸ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ­Î½Î±Î¹.Accordingly, in the Optics, p.304, I used the word, 'superimposed' ^17.The best word in German is \"drangesetzt.\"From this I reasoned as follows.Whether Mars ran beneath it centrally, or grazed its northern or southern margin, it could not have been removed from the star latitudinally by any great distance.For indeed, the latitudes are less uncertain than the longitudes, since the manner of their variation is simpler and more consistent, as is proven in this book.We now know that the node retrogresses with respect to the fixed stars, by 4Â° 15' during one \"year of the Dog,\"18 as was proven in Ch.17.For Ptolemy, the northern limit was considered to precede Cor Leonis by 3Â½ degrees.For us, over the intervening 410 years, it had retrogressed one degree, so that at the time of observation it would be 2Â½Â° before Cor Leonis.Therefore, the node is 87Â½Â° past Cor Leonis.But Mars is 56Â° 35' past Cor Leonis.Therefore, it is 31Â° from the node, making the inclination 57Â½â, which, by the parallax of the orb, results in a true latitude of 1Â° 7' ^19.But now it is clear from Brahe that the  latitude of the Bright Star of the Brow is 1Â° 5', while that of the Northernmost Star of the Brow is 1Â° 42'.So the latitude appeared to refute me concerning the Bright Star of the Brow, leading me to believe that this star was occulted by Mars, and not the other.But this collusion of numbers is fortuitous.For in the latitude of the Northernmost Star of the Brow Brahe and Ptolemy are in agreement, the former pronouncing it to be 1Â° 46', and the latter, 1Â° 42'.In the latitude of the Bright one they differ.Ptolemy has 1Â° 20'; Brahe, 1Â° 5'.But the former numerical equality results from an error, and the latter difference is really more like an agreement.For the latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same amount, since the ecliptic has been transposed and the declinations of the degrees of the ecliptic have been altered by the same amount, as Brahe proved and as we have said in Ch.68.Thus if it is trueâand it is very trueâthat the latitude of the Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is 1Â° 5' today, at the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus it was no less than 1Â° 20', probably greater.And so Mars has a smaller northern latitude than either of the stars mentioned, and passed beneath both.For it is certain that even if we are too high by a whole degree in [the position of] the node, the latitude in the calculation was wrong by no more than three minutes.Also, it has now been shown in Ch.64 to be entirely uncertain whether the northern latitude for Mars was also once greater in the southern signs.Therefore, my clever interpretation of the word âÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎµÎ¸ÎµÎ¹ÎºÎ­Î½Î±Î¹ was in vain.It can only be explained as denoting the stars' being placed side by side in the same longitude; and on this ground, the one that I favor is just as good a candidate as the Bright, its greater latitude notwithstanding.Consider whether the meaning could be this: that since in the northern part of the brow there are three stars in the form of a triangle, Mars was sighted in the middle of them, and was thus \"placed upon the northern brow\" of Scorpius, it having simply been made one of that number of stars that are in the northern part of the brow of Scorpius.This interpretation is furthered by the observer's having said \"northern brow\" rather than \"northern star of the brow\", since he is denoting, not one single star, but an entire part of the constellation.So these two ancient observations are of no use to us in estimating either the latitude or the ratio of the orbs at that time.Therefore, since there are no observations to the contrary to impede us, while the extreme likelihood of our position confirms us in it, let us conclude that the ratio of the orbs is also the same today as it was once, while the maximum latitudes today are somewhat altered.Chapter 8Tycho Braheâs table of observed and computed observations of Marsâs oppositions to the line of the sunâs mean motion, and an examination thereof.Now the table, mentioned above, was the following:An accurate rendering of the motion of the planet Mars on its eccentric from trustworthy acronychal observations in a variety of positions, carried out sedulously of twenty years (1580 to 1600).1The amended mean longitudinal motion of Mars at the \n",

Ptolemy.Care was taken, where appropriate, concerning refraction, using the solar parallax.THIS, THEN, IS BRAHEâS TABLEWe shall begin the examination of the sunâs mean motion with the listed instants of equal time, as many as the table presents.For indeed, it is the sunâs mean position in opposition to which the table says the star Mars was found, referred to the ecliptic.You see here that the sunâs mean position differs from opposition to Marsâs apparent position on the ecliptic by 13Â½â in some cases, nearly thrice the error which could arise through a change of hypothesis.Therefore, the exactness of their hypothesis did not prevent my seeking another.But they permitted this discrepancy advisedly.This is clear from the following: since the nodes are about 17Â° Taurus and Scorpio, and the limits about 17Â° Leo and Aquarius, as will be said below, the additions and subtractions are made chiefly at 17Â° Cancer, 25Â° Virgo, 4Â° Scorpio, 27Â° Sagittarius, and 13Â° Pisces, intermediate points, and none at 21Â° Leo and 18Â° Scorpio, the nodes and the limit.They therefore had reason to believe that a planet is not divested of its second inequality unless the sunâs departure from the node is as great as the planetâs on its own orbit.Their intentions, moreover, were not consistent.For, in their way of thinking, the difference ought to be greatest at 3Â° Cancer, because Cancer is closest to the 45th degree,5 where this difference is generally greatest.But at 17Â° Cancer they subtracted 5 minutes, while at 3Â° Cancer, one minute only.Because of this, the following table, comparing the positions (referred to the orbit of Mars) with the mean positions of the sun at these moments, is presented.Clearly, they did not compensate the whole difference in this way.We shall discuss this plan of theirs once more a little later.Now, we shall also examine Marsâs mean motion, for the sake of which, see the following table.6 7I am therefore missing something small in the mean longitude.For, that nearly everywhere there is half a minute too much, may be so because of my having computed the mean motions from the most recent table, in which something might possibly have been deliberately altered.There follows a table of Marsâs eccentric positions.All positions are tolerably accurate except 27Â° Sagittarius.Here, for various reasons, a small but appreciable quantity has been accumulated.First, the sunâs position is 26Â° 45â 24â Gemini.Now the computed position on Marsâs orbit is 26Â° 24â 43â Sagittarius.In the opinion of the table, 10â 20â are to be subtracted from the latter to refer it to the ecliptic.Therefore, the computed position on the ecliptic would be 26Â° 24â 13â Sagittarius, a difference from opposition to the sun of 21â 11â.Chapter 9On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars.But it is now time for us to discuss in detail this adjusting to the ecliptic or to the planet's orbit, which serves as a foundation.First, the table provides us the following information from the observations: the northern latitude takes its rise from 18Â° Taurus, at which it was five minutes, reaches its observed maximum at 21Â° Leo, decreased thereafter and became only 1âÂ° at 3Â° Scorpio, but right away at 27Â° Sagittarius it was south  and a rather large 4Â°, and stillgreater at 13Â° Pisces.From this one concludes roughly that the ascending node is a little before 18Â° Taurus, and the descending node far beyond 3Â° Scorpio.The nodes will therefore be around 17Â° Taurus and 17Â° Scorpio, and the limits around 17Â° Leo and Aquarius.Since the plane of Marsâs eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit.I use the term, âobserved arcsâ, because here one must mentally separate out the planetâs eccentricity, and proceed as though Marsâs path were in the orb of the fixed stars, exactly as is the ecliptic, and as though it really intersected the latter.And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planetâs body intersects the ecliptic.It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosiusâs On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planetâs path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect.And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit.Consequently, the arc between the planetâs position on its orbit and the nearest node is always greater than that between its ecliptic position and the same node.Now when we observe the planets, we do not feel convinced that we have  defined their exact positions until we have referred them to the ecliptic.We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found.The ecliptic position is used, therefore, to aid our memory and comprehension.But when, on the other hand, we compute the planet in its own hypothesis,1 we are not concerned with the ecliptic to which it is inclined, but with the exact path of the planet.Therefore, to be able tocompare the observed position with the computed position, we must either extend the arc between the ecliptic position and the nearer node, or abridge the arc between the body of the planet and the same node, so that from the former operation the position on the orbit might be given, and from the latter, the ecliptic position.This is actually accomplished by adding or subtracting, according as the node precedes or follows the planetâs position.Such care concerning the planets Ptolemy considered unnecessary.Copernicus did not forego it in treating the moon, and Tycho Brahe diligently embraced it for the sake of precision.To continue: in the referring process which we have been considering, there are two things I would like to know, both of which I can seek using the same procedure  and diagram.Let A be the sidereal position of the node, AB the arc of the ecliptic, and upon it let AC be set equal to AB, and let the planet be observed beneath C. Further, from C let an arc be drawn perpendicular to the ecliptic, and let it be CE.Now in the first place the ancients thought that since E is the position on the ecliptic and C the position of the orbit of the planet I, the planet is at the point opposite the sun when the sun is at E, the planet being observed at C. However, as was said above, those who constructed the tables thought that the planet is not exactly at opposition to the sun unless arc AB,the elongation of the place opposite the sun from the same node, is made equal to AC (the observed distance of the planet from the node).Now the truth of the matter is quite different.The planet is, indeed, seen in opposition to the sun at that time, but it really is not, and the advantage we seek from the planetâs opposition to the sun is more harmed by making AC and AB equal, than they themselves were hoping it would be corrected.For why are the planets observed at opposition to the sun?In order, of course, that they then lack the second inequality of longitude.And when the point opposite the sun is at B and the planet is at C, both being between the nodes and the limits, the planet is more wrapped up in the second inequality of longitude than if the point opposite the sun were at E, the planet remaining at C. For let G be the sun, the center of the planetary system, at which all the orbs intersect the ecliptic, whether in the Copernican or the Brahean form.Let G be joined to A and E, points on the ecliptic, and let the earth be on the line EG, at H. Let HC be joined, and from H let the sun G be observed opposite E, while from the same point H let the planet be seen at C, its sidereal position along the line HC.Therefore, in this sighting, the planet is really on the line HC.It is, however, far below the fixed stars.Let it be at the point I on the line HC, and let a straight line be drawn from G through I, which will intersect the arc CE.For the whole plane CEHG is beneath the arc EC.Let its point of intersection be F, and let a third arc AF be drawn from A through F to BC, cutting BC at D. It is obvious that the plane of the planetâs eccentric viewed from H towards C is set beneath AF, not AC, and that when the point opposite the sun is at E, the planet will really be beneath F, while when the point opposite the sun is located at B the planet is really going to be beneath D, although both do appear beneath C. But AD is shorter than the legs of the isosceles triangle BAC.Therefore, the point B opposite the sun is farther from A than is D, the position beneath which the planet is at the moment they have chosen.Therefore, the sun really stands beyond the point opposite the planet's true position.This is contrary to what they proposed to do.But it is likewise false that if the orbit of the planet were beneath AC, AB should on that account be taken equal to AC.For the orbitâs really being beneath AD is likewise not sufficient reason for taking AD equal to AB.For since the planet is observed at the point opposite the sun in order that it might shed the second inequality of longitude, while the longitude is to be reckoned on the planetâs true orbit, or on AD which stands above it, surely, unless the point opposite the sun falls upon the arc drawn through the planet at right angles to the orbit (that is, unless ADB is a right angle), the point B opposite the sun will not coincide in longitude with D. But if ADB is a right angle, AB is longer than AD.They are therefore not equal.Clearly, therefore, the equality between arcs AC and AB that the table aspires to is undermined.However, for practical purposes, these differences are smaller than can be perceived.I therefore do not hesitate to allow the place opposite the sun to be at E, with AEF right and AFE consequently acute, even though it has just been demonstrated that AFE should be right instead.But it was also necessary to proceed against a new claim of accuracy, by means of accurate arguments.What follows here is the harm arising from this accuracy.In the second place, then, I wish to establish this: that in the table of adjustment they followed a procedure that is unsound.For, given Marsâs ecliptic position E and apparent latitude EC, they computed the length of AC, and stated that the planet on its orbit was then distant from the node by their quantity AC.Now the orbit of the planet (whose first inequality we are investigating) is not beneath AC, but beneath AD, as was just shown.Therefore, the arc AC has nothing to do with the first inequality, but adulterates the planetâs true elongations from A. And furthermore, the apparent latitude is EHC, while the true latitude of the point F, the inclination of the line GF to the ecliptic, is EGF.Thus, although the second inequality of longitude is swallowed up at opposition to the sun, the second inequality of latitude is nonetheless near its maximum there, and its measure is the angle HIG.Therefore, just as the whole latitude EC causes AC to be longer than AE by the arc EB, similarly, the part FC or HIG of this apparent latitude, which is a result of the second inequality, makes AC longer than AF.So it is longer than it should be.And this error cannot be ignored, as it can be as much as 9 minutes.This error could also have been perceived in the inconstancy of the angle BAC, which they attributed to the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars's orbit.This is clear from the result obtained if you suppose the arc AC to be increased by the amount of the addition expressed in the table, and use this and AC to compute the angle EAC.For the angles come out as in the accompanying table,  from which it is clear that in the northern semicircle they suppose an angle of maximum northern latitude of 4Â° 33â, and in the southern, of 6Â° 26â south.According to this, at the subtending line connecting the nodes, which passes through the sun or earth, the plane of the eccentric would somehow be bent, since the upper part is less inclined than the lower.Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planetâs eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle.However, all this is in conflict with the simplicity of the celestial motions, as many examples from experience will attest.Therefore, the true procedure for referring the inclinations to the orbit is this: from the planetâs position E on the ecliptic, known from the observations, to find the angle of inclination EGF for that position, using the method that will follow below.Then, since the angle E is right, from AE and EF (the measure of the angle EGF) AF is found by trigonometry, or instead of EF the constant angle  EAF may be used.And since, from arguments which I shall present below, it is clear that for the star Mars the angle EAF is not greater than about 1Â° 50â, the adjustment about 45Â° from the node (where it is maximum) accordingly does not exceed one minute, for which the table nonetheless has one add 8 or 10 minutes in certain places.So for this reason, too, the hypothesis can be in error by as much as 7 and 9 minutes, since the observations upon which it was founded suffered no little loss through this adjustment.I was consequently subject to much less restraint than before in seeking out a new hypothesis.</div>"
