To find the position of Mars at opposition, Kepler computed the angular distance that Mars and Earth—now substituting the place of the Sun—moved during 17 hours 20 minutes; Mars moved eastward about 16' 20\" and the Sun westward about 42' 18\". Accordingly, Kepler determined the longitude of Mars at opposition to be 198° 37' 50\" from which he subtracted about 39\" in order to correct Mars's orbit; he got 198° 37' 10\" (18° 37' 10\" Libra).   \n",
