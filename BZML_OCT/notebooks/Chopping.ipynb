Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there. Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate. But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet. It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it.

Its altitude being 35½°, it was not subject to refraction. After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. This would have appeared larger, except that Mars was low enough to be refracted, and appeared too high. For the refraction at this altitude is 3½’, of which about 2' is accounted to the latitude; thus, the apparent latitude would be 5' south. But since we are...</td>\n",

For the latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same amount, since the ecliptic has been transposed and the declinations of the degrees of the ecliptic have been altered by the same amount, as Brahe proved and as we have said in Ch. 68. Thus if it is true—and it is very true—that the latitude of the Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is 1° 5' today, at the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus it was no less than 1° 20', probably greater.

       "5869  Let us begin with the nodes. On 1593 December 10, at 7h 0m in the evening, Mars was observed at 4° 44' Aries, with latitude 0° 1' 15\" south, parallax not accounted for ^1. Its altitude being 35½°, it was not subject to refraction. After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. This would have appeared larger, except that Mars was low enough to be refracted, and appeared too high. For the refraction at this altitude is 3½’, of which about 2' is accounted to the latitude; thus, the apparent latitude would be 5' south. But since we are...   \n",

       "6662  But this collusion of numbers is fortuitous. For in the latitude of the Northernmost Star of the Brow Brahe and Ptolemy are in agreement, the former pronouncing it to be 1° 46', and the latter, 1° 42'. In the latitude of the Bright one they differ. Ptolemy has 1° 20'; Brahe, 1° 5'. But the former numerical equality results from an error, and the latter difference is really more like an agreement. For the latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same amount, since the ecliptic has been transposed and the declinations of the degrees of the ecliptic have been altered by the same amount, as Brahe proved and as we have said in Ch. 68. Thus if it is true—and it is very true—that the latitude of the Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is 1° 5' today, at the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus it was no less than 1° 20', probably greater. And so Mar...   \n",
