    "Kepler's \"New Astronomy (Astronomia Nova)\" was completed and published in Linz in 1609. Buried deep in this, at times very mystical book, is Kepler's first formulation of his first and second laws of planetary motion, which in modern parlance can be stated as follows:\n",
    "*  Planetary orbits are ellipses, with the Sun located at one focus;\n",
    "*  Planets move along their elliptical orbit with a speed such that a line segment joining the planet to the Sun sweeps equal surface areas in equal time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time he reconceptualized \"oppositions\" as based upon the observed, rather than \"average,\" position of the Sun, Kepler analyzed Brahe's individual **observations** of Mars for potential errors of various other kinds. with this introduction observations, sentiments play an important role in tracking the knowledge. This motivates us to:  \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position.
