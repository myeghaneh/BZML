       "'Chapter 1 On the distinction between the first motion and the second or proper motions; and in the proper motions, between the first and the second inequality. The testimony of the ages confirms that the motions of the planets are orbicular. Reason, having borrowed from experience, immediately presumes this: that their gyrations are perfect circles. For among figures it is circles, and among bodies the heavens, that are considered the most perfect. However, when experience seems to teach something different to those who pay careful attention, namely, that the planets deviate from a simple circular path, it gives rise to a powerful sense of wonder, which at length drives people to look into causes. It is just this from which astronomy arose among humans. Astronomy\\'s aim is considered to be to show why the stars\\' motions appear to be irregular on earth, despite their being exceedingly well ordered in heaven, and to investigate the specific circles whereby the stars may be moved, so that by their aid the positions and appearances of those stars at any given time may be predicted. Before the distinction between the first motion(1) and the second motions(2) was established, people noted (in contemplating the sun, moon and stars) that their diurnal paths were visually very nearly equivalent to circles. These were, however, entwined one upon another like yarn on a ball, and the circles were for the most part smaller(3) circles of the sphere, rarely the greatest(4) (such as here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south. They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion. The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I). The sun (on ABE) is slower, as on the following day it stands at E and so its setting follows that of the fixed stars at I with which on the previous day it was conjoined on HA. Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG). Hence the Pythagoreans, when they shared out musical tones among the stars, gave the lowest (the hypate among the strings of the lyre)1 to the moon, because the motions of both were slowest. Hence have originated the words προηγούμενος and ὑπολειπτικός ^2. The former of these terms originally corresponded to a star which, on the next day, comes to its setting earlier (the sun E is said to be προηγούμενος with respect to the moon G). The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I). For more on this subject see our Optics, Ch. 10. 3 This first adumbration of astronomy consists, not of the unfolding of a cause, but solely of the experience of the eyes, extremely slowly acquired. It cannot be explained in figures or numbers, nor can it be extrapolated into the future, since it is always different from itself, to the extent that no spiral is equal to any other in increments of time, and none carries over into the next with a curvature of the same quantity. Nevertheless, there are some people today who, riding roughshod over two thousand years\\' work, care, erudition, and knowledge, are trying to revive this, obtruding admiration of themselves far and wide (an attempt which has not been fruitless among the ignorant). Those with more experience consider them with good reason to be incompetent, or (if, like that man Patricius,4 they want to be known as philosophers) to act mad with reasoning. For it was helpful to astronomers to understand that two simple motions, the first one and the second ones, the common and the proper, are intermingled, and that from this mingling that continuous sequence of conglomerated motions follows. And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile. When a planet (such as the moon at G) is \"left behind\" (by the sun at E or the fixed stars at I), it is carried in consequence*  through FG more swiftly than the sun (through AE) or the fixed stars (through HI). It, however, it appears to be \\'leading\\' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion. For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at P while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP. This turned out to be of great profit in astronomy in grasping the simplicity  of the motions. Instead of unending spirals, a new one always being added to the end of the earlier one at E or G, there remained little but the solitary circles FG and AE, and a single common motion, either of all the planets and the whole world as well in a direction opposite to the proper motions, or (with the world standing still, according to Aristarchus) of the earth\\'s globe T around the axis QR in the same direction as the proper motions. Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them. For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observed—less striking to the eyes—because the diurnal motion was very swift. And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals. But now, that minute division and distribution of the star\\'s proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously. First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun. For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen. At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion. From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5. And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence. If one were to bundle all this together, and were at the same time to believe that the sun really moves through the zodiac in the space of a year, as Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe believed, he would then have to grant that the circuits of the three superior planets through the aethereal space, composed as they are of several motions, are real spirals, not (as before) in the manner of balled up yarn, with spirals set side by side, but more like the shape of a pretzel,6 as in the following diagram. This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the year 1580 until the year 1596, on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it. These motions, continued farther, would become unintelligibly intricate, for the continuation is boundless, never returning to its previous path. Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram. Moreover, we are forced to ascribe similar spirals to the remaining four planets, and much more complicated ones to Venus, if the earth stands still. Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun\\'s motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun. Nevertheless, both leave the spirals themselves in the heavens. Copernicus, by attributing a single annual motion to the earth, entirely rids all the planets of these extremely intricate spirals, leading the individual planets into their respective orbits7 quite bare and very nearly circular. In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the \\'garlands\\' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times. Again, however, it was noticed that these loops in each planet\\'s spirals are unequal in different signs of the zodiac, so that in some places the planet would retrogress through a longer arc of the zodiac, at others through a shorter, and now for a longer, now for a shorter time. Nor is the increment of brightness of a retrograde planet always the same. Because, if one were to compute the times and distances between the midpoints of the retrogressions, neither times nor arcs would be equal, nor would any of the times answer to its arc in the same proportion. Nevertheless, for each planet there was a certain sign of the zodiac from which, through the semicircle to the opposite sign in either direction, all those things successively increased. From these observations it came to be understood that for any planet there are two inequalities mixed together into one, the first of which completes its cycle with the planet\\'s return to the same sign of the zodiac, the other with the sun\\'s return to the planet. Now the causes and measures of these inequalities could not be investigated without separating the mixed inequalities and looking into each one by itself. They therefore thought they should begin with the first inequality, it being more nearly constant and simple, since they saw an example of it in the sun\\'s motion, without the interference of the other inequality. But in order to separate the second inequality from this first one, they could not do anything but consider the planets on those nights at whose beginning they rise while the sun is setting, which thence were called ἀκρονυχίους [acronychal, or  \"night rising\"]. For since the presence and conjunction of the sun makes them go faster than usual, and the opposition of the sun has the opposite effect, before and after these points they are surely much removed from the positions they were going to occupy through the action of the first inequality. Therefore, at the very moments of conjunction with and opposition to the sun they are traversing those very positions that are their own. But since they cannot be seen when in conjunction with the sun, only the opposition to the sun remains as suitable for this purpose. But since the sun\\'s mean and apparent motions*  are two different things, for the sun, too, is subject to the first inequality, the question is raised which of these releases the planets from the second inequality, and whether the planets should be considered when at opposition to the sun\\'s apparent position or its mean position. Ptolemy chose the mean motion, thinking that the difference (if any) between taking the mean sun and the apparent sun could not be perceived in the observations, but that the form of computation and of the proofs would become free from difficulty if the sun\\'s mean motion were taken. Copernicus and Tycho followed Ptolemy, carrying over his assumptions. I, as you see in Ch. 15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum, instead establish the apparent position, the true body of the sun, as my reference point, and will vindicate that position with proofs in Parts 4 and 5 of this work. But before that, I shall prove in this first part that one who substitutes the sun\\'s apparent for its mean motion establishes a completely different orbit for the planet in the aether, whichever of the more celebrated opinions of the world he follows. Since this proof depends upon the equivalence of hypotheses, we shall begin with this equivalence. Chapter 2 On the first and simple equivalence, that of the eccentric and the concentric with an epicycle, and their physical causes. And now, to begin, I take up the equivalence of hypotheses adopted to save [the appearances of] the first inequality,1 which were demonstrated by Ptolemy in Book III and by Copernicus in Book III Ch. 15. There, an eccentric is shown to square accounts with an epicycle on a concentric, provided, that is, that the line of apsides in the eccentric and the line through the center of the epicycle and the planet on the concentric always remain parallel, and that the semidiameter of the epicycle in the latter is equal to the eccentricity in the former, while the semidiameters of eccentric and concentric are equal. And also provided that, in the former, the planet is moved uniformly on its eccentric, so as to traverse equal arcs in equal times. First, let A be the position of the observer and the center of the concentric BB on which is the epicycle BC, BE. Let the arcs between two B\\'s, or the angles BAB, be equal, and the planet be first at C, then at E and G, with the lines BE, BG parallel to BC. Next, let β be the center of the eccentric γζ, with βγ, βε equal to AB, and let α be the point at which the observer is, and βα (the eccentricity) be equal to the semidiameter of the epicycle BC, BE, and parallel to them. Also, let the arcs γε, γζ, that is, the angles γβε γβζ, be equal both among themselves and to the former angles BAB. I say that the distances AC, αγ, are equal, and likewise AE to αε, AG to αη, AD to αδ, AH to αθ, and AF to αζ; and again, that the angles EAC, εαγ are equal; and that in each instance the planet, although its motion is uniform, will appear from A, α slow at C, γ, and swift at D, δ. As I said, Ptolemy demonstrated this in Book III, so there is no need for further discussion. To geometers, the diagram speaks for itself, and others may go to Ptolemy. As for the physical accounts of these models, there is a greater difference between the two. That this may be very clear, it must be researched at somewhat greater depth, in one way from Peurbach2 using Aristotle\\'s principles, and in another way from Tycho. Ptolemy has described these circles to us in their bare form, such as geometry applied to the observations shows. Peurbach set up a way for them to be traversed that follows Aristotle, who attempted this same thing upon the geometrical suppositions of Eudoxus and Calippus, by which they had treated their astronomy. And while these authors used 25 orbs to demonstrate all the inequalities of the planets, Aristotle (since he believed the heavens to be filled with solid orbs)3 thought that 24 other revolving orbs had to be interposed in order to free each lower orb from the revolving effect which, on account of the contiguity of surfaces, it was going to receive from the orb above it. So, having thus accumulated 49 orbs in all (or 53 or 55, following Calippus), he attributed to each its own mover. Any one of these would be responsible for the perfectly uniform motion of its own orb and all inferior ones which it encompassed. This motion would take place inside the closest surrounding superior orb, as if in a sort of place,4 and from the mover would proceed a constant determination [ratio] of both the direction in which the motion was to occur, and the swiftness with which the orb was to return to its starting position. Moreover, since that philosopher held the motion to be eternal, he also stipulated that the movers  were eternal. Since they created motion for an infinite time, and since Aristotle knew that nothing material could receive the form of infinity, he maintained that they are also immaterial, and separable principles, and consequently immobile. Also, since he had constructed the world\\'s eternity from the eternity of motion, and this duration of essence, the goodness and perfection of the whole world, was opposed to destruction, which was bad, he therefore attributed to those principles the highest perfection and the understanding thereof, and from good understanding the will to see it accomplished, lest the good not be done well. In this way, he introduced to us separate minds which, it turned out, were gods, as the perpetual administrators of the heavens\\' motions. They also bestowed a moving soul [anima motrix], more closely attached to the orbs and giving them form, so that the mind would only have to give assistance. This was either because it seemed necessary that the mover and the moving thing have some common ground, or because the potentiality, considered in relation to the distance to be traversed, should not be infinite, just as there exists no infinite motion, but only motion through a certain space in a certain time. They therefore transferred this potentiality for creating motion to a soul, for the meantime becoming subject to matter for the purpose of inhering in the orbs of the heavens. Now this coupling of mind and soul is indeed quite in agreement with the detailed considerations of the astronomers, even though the philosophers\\' mode of argument is chiefly metaphysical. For it is the same in humans: the moving faculty is one thing; that which makes use of the moving faculty according to the indications of the senses—the Will—is another. The senses differ from the moving faculty both in the means they use and in the excellence of their structure, which in the organs of sense is more admirable than in the seats of the motive faculty. Similarly, if we should propose these Aristotelian orbs as objects of contemplation, two things will present themselves to us: 1) the motive force, sufficient for the round orb, from whose activity and constant strength the time of revolution arises; 2) the direction in which it acts. The former is more correctly ascribed to the animate faculty, and the latter to its intelligent or remembering nature. Now although through this solidity of orbs all motions or celestial appearances are so provided for that nothing is left to the providence of the presiding movers, while the whole variety of motions is a consequence of the number and disposition of the orbs; an although nothing else is required but that the moving souls receive and retain their activity and be set going from the first moment of creation in whatever direction is theirs, sent forth from their prisons, as it were, into space;5 nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that there is need of the supreme mind to launch any of the planets in its own direction, as if into its fixed and proper province. Aristotle, who knew nothing of the world\\'s beginning and did not believe in it, of necessity ascribed this function instead to the governors of the motions. The followers of Aristotle, and even Scaliger,6 who professes to be a Christian, openly contend that this motion of the orbs is voluntary, and that the principle of volition for them is intellectual intuition and desire. So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet. Then they attributed two moving souls to these two orbs (if they should carry through with their physical considerations), both with the same amount of power, proportionally, so that they would complete their periods in the same time, although moving in opposite directions. The other model requires two deferents (which remain motionless so long as we abide by the simplicity of the motions, mentally removing the progression of the apogees), and one orb with the thickness of the planetary body. In this orb is a soul which drives it around with a uniform effort in that direction in which it was projected in the beginning. Thus, if this solidity of the orbs and the other assumptions be granted, in the first model BC and BE will remain parallel, and in the second, the orb γε will go around the center β, even though the movers in the former pay no attention to AC, nor in the latter, to β. For they are governed by material necessity or by the arrangement and contiguity of the orbs. But, with arguments of the greatest certainty, Tycho Brahe has demolished the solidity of the orbs, which hitherto was able to serve these moving souls, blind as they were, as walking sticks for finding their appointed road; and hence the planets complete their courses in the pure aether, just like birds in the air. Therefore, we shall have to philosophize differently about: these models. Let it then be assumed among the first: principles, that every force by which motions of this sort: are administered dwells in the body of the planet itself, and is not: to be sought: outside it Now the planet: must execute a perfect circle in the pure aether by its inherent: force, an epicycle in the first model and an eccentric in the second. It is therefore clear that the mover will to have two jobs: first, it must have a faculty strong enough to move its body about, and second, it: must have sufficient knowledge to find a circular boundary in the pure aethereal air, which in itself is not divided into such regions. This is the function of mind. Please don\\'t tell me that the motive faculty itself, a scion of a simple and brute soul, has a native altitude for circular motion, exactly like a stone\\'s nature to descend in a straight line. For I deny that God has created any perpetual non-rectilinear motion that is not ruled by a mind. Even in the human body, all the muscles move according to tire principles of rectilinear motions. They either swell by contacting info themselves, or stretch out, the ends moving apart: in the former case, the member approaches the muscle, while in the latter, the member recedes. This same thing takes place in its own way in the circular muscles  that are set up as guards for orifices. When they are extended by the circular filaments, they relax and open the passage, and constrict it when the filaments return into the form of a smaller circle. There is no member whatever that rotates uniformly and without impediment. On the contrary, the bending of the head, feet, arms, and tongue is expressed in certain mechanical devices by many straight muscles carried across or stretched out from one place to another. In this way it is brought about that the motive faculty, which by its own nature tends in a straight line, swings its member in a gyre. Likewise, certain machines raise water to great heights, not because the nature of the body, which conveys the motion, tends to an exalted position, but because, by an arrangement of channels, it is brought about that the water necessarily gives way upwards when a greater weight tends downwards. And even if the motion of certain members were perfectly circular, they7 nonetheless could not be perpetual. There should be no great wonder at this, since in the human body mind presides over the animate faculty. Surely, then, if there had been any way of so constructing some moving faculty that it might be able to rotate some body, it would not have been neglected in the human body. Besides, it is quite impossible for any mind to manifest a circular path without recourse to the guidepost either of a center or of some body which might appear under a greater or smaller angle according to its approach or recession. For a circle is both defined and brought to perfection by the same criterion, namely, equality of distance from the middle. No matter how many of these motive faculties you set up, a circle, even for God, is nothing other than what was just said. Geometers do, of course, show how, given three points on a circumference, to form a continuous circle, but in this very proof it is presupposed that some portion of the circumference (that which passes through the three points) is already constructed. Who, then, will show the planet this starting place, in conformity with which it will make the rest of its path? This is possible in no other way than if the planet\\'s mover (as in Avicenna\\'s opinion) imagine for itself the center of its orb and its distance from it, or if it be assisted by providing some other property of a circle in order to lay out its own circle. We will therefore now form the phys ical hypothesis of these two models in another way In the latter, simpler one, if our supposition is valid that the mover driving the planet around the path γεδ is in the planet itself, there will have to accrue to the planet\\'s mover some sort of awareness of the apparent magnitude of the body at α seen (or as if seen) from γ, ε, η, δ. The planet will therefore have to strive both to move forward uniformly (this the undivided and unimpeded forces of the moving soul provide), and to exhibit all the distances αγ, αε, αη, αδ, in such order that they follow by a geometrical law from the eccentric βγ. To this end, the mover should also know how much longer αγ is than αδ; that is, by how much the path which it will traverse is eccentric from the body at α around which it is to go. The planet\\'s mover will thus be occupied with many things at once. To escape this conclusion, one must assert that the planet pays attention to the point β, entirely empty of any body or real quality, and maintains equal distances from that point. The prior model is explained physically thus. Let a motive power be conceived which, seated on the concentric B and itself without body, moves around the body at A with a uniform exertion of forces, maintaining equal distances from that point. Let there be another power in the body of the planet C, capable of holding its attention on the incorporeal power at B, estimating and maintaining its distance from that power, and moving uniformly around it. Thus, as before, this power again will have numerous tasks. But it is also incredible in itself that an immaterial power reside in a non-body, be moved in space and time, but not have a substrate to move itself (as I said) from place to place. And I am making these absurd assumptions in order to establish in the end the impossibility that every cause of a planet\\'s motions inhere in its body or somewhere else in its orb, and to build a path for other less difficult forms of motions that are more readily persuasive. I have presented these models hypothetically, the hypothesis being astronomy\\'s testimony that the planet\\'s path is a perfect eccentric circle such as was described. If astronomy will discover something different, the physical theories will also change. In this equivalence of hypotheses, not only the equality of the apparent angles at A and α, but also the actual paths themselves of the planets through the surrounding aether, each remain the same. For in both shape and size, the planet traverses an arc from C to E through angle CAE that is also the same as it traverses from γ to ε through the equal angle γαε. . CHAPTER 3 On the equivalence and unanimity of different points of observation and of hypotheses, for laying out one and the same planetary path. Next, I must show how one and the same planetary motion, while in itself remaining the same, can display one or another appearance, and how the pair of forms are equivalent here. About centers A and γ, with equal radii AC, γε, let the circles CD, εζ be described with CA, εγ drawn through the centers parallel to one another, and other lines AB, γδ, and AD, γζ, through the centers inclined to the former, both pairs likewise parallel. Also, about B let an epicycle be described, with radius BE, and likewise  about D with radius DG equal to BE. Let the planet be placed at E and G, so that DG and AB are parallel. On the line δγ let a segment equal to BE be set out on the side opposite δ, and let it be γβ. Let G be joined with A and ζ with β. The hypotheses will therefore be equivalent, by the preceding chapter, and to an observer placed at A and β, EAG and δβζ will be equal. EA and δβ will also be equal, as well as GA and ζβ. And finally, the arcs EG and δζ will be equal. Now let a smaller epicycle be described upon BCD with radii BI, CF, DH, and let AC be extended to F, and BI and DH be parallel to CF. And let the planet be on IFH. Again, by ch. 2, the circle IFH will be equal to the circle δζ. Next, extend the arc IF from the point δ, so as to end at ε, and from ε through γ draw εγ, such that εγ is parallel to CA. And let a magnitude equal to CF be set out on the line εγ, and let it be γα, on the side opposite ε. Let I and H be joined with A, and also δ and ζ with α. Again, therefore, the hypotheses will be equivalent by the preceding chapter, and to an observer placed at A and α, FAH and εαζ will be equal, as well as FAI and εαδ. FA and εα will also be equal, as well as HA and ζα, and IA and δα. And finally, the arcs FH and εζ will be equal and similar, as are also FI and εδ, by construction. Therefore, if the path of the planet remain the same while the observer is moved from β to α, different appearances will be produced at the same moments of time. For the same places, δ and ζ, are viewed in different ways from β and α. On the other hand, if the observer remain at A, and the quantity of the planet\\'s path EG, IH remain the same while changing its place, the planet will again appear in different places, even when at the same place on its path, because the entire path has been shifted. Accordingly, since the planet, whether viewed from α or β, is at δ, or at ζ, at the same moment in each observation, and the hypotheses are entirely equivalent, it must also be said that I and E, which are positions of different epicycles, are occupied by the planet at the same moment. The same is true of G and H. The only difference is that in the first diagram the planet\\'s path is shifted by altering the epicycle in its position, the observer remaining in the same place, while in the second diagram, for the planet\\'s path the position also stays the same while the observer\\'s position is changed by the same amount in the opposite direction. If required, however, it is possible to keep the path fixed in the former and the observer fixed in the latter fixed by shifting what is now fixed, in accordance with the demonstrations of the preceding chapter. This demonstration will be put to use below. For surely, if the first inequality of the superior planets could be accounted for by the simple hypothesis of the second chapter, no difficulty would arise as to whether one should examine the first inequality at mean opposition to the sun, or at apparent opposition. For the actual path would in fact remain the same, and in both models the planet would be at the same points of the path at any given moment. Only the position of this path, in the first model, would be altered through the space of the sun\\'s eccentricity, while in the second, although the path would stay fixed, the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned would also be shifted by the same amount. In the physical account, the above characteristics remain unchanged. Only their quantities change as the motive powers are intensified. CHAPTER 4 On the imperfect equivalence between a double epicycle on a concentric, or eccentric-epicycle, and equant on an eccentric. That is how it would be if there were scope for the simple hypothesis of ch. 3 to account for the first inequality of the superior planets. However, for demonstrating the first and simple inequality of the planets, Ptolemy makes use of a more elaborate hypothesis. About center B let an eccentric DE be described, with eccentricity BA, so that A is the place of the observer. The line drawn through AB will indicate the apogee at D and the perigee at F. Upon this line, above B, let another segment BC be extended, equal to BA. C will be the point of the equant, that is, the point about which the planet completes equal angles in equal times, even though it lays out the circle around B rather than around C. In Book V ch. 4, as well as Book IV ch. 71, Copernicus marks this hypothesis among other things in this respect, that it offends against physical principles by instituting irregular celestial motions. For let a point E be chosen on the circle which the planet is bodily traversing, and let it be connected with C, B, and A. Now let DCE be a right angle, as well as ECF. Now since these angles are equal (for they are set up in equal times), and the exterior angle DCE is equal to the interior angles CBE and CEB, therefore, when the part CEB is subtracted, the remainder CBE or DBE will be less than DCE. Consequently, FBE will be greater than DCE or FCE. But the arc DE measures the angle DBE, and the arc EF measures the angle EBF. Therefore, DE is smaller than EF, and the planet passes over them in equal times. Therefore, the same solid orb (Copernicus believed in them)2 in which the planet inheres is slow when the planet borne by the orb proceeds from D to E, and fast when the planet goes from E to F. Therefore, the  entire solid orb is now fast, now slow. This Copernicus rejects as absurd. Now I, too, for good reasons, would reject as absurd the notion that the moving power should preside over a solid orb, everywhere uniform, rather than over the bare planet. But because there are no solid orbs, consider now the physical coherence of this hypothesis when very slight changes are made, as described below. This hypothesis, it should be added, posits two motive powers to move the planet (Ptolemy was unaware of this). It places one of these in the body A (which, in the reformed astronomy will be the very sun itself), and says that this power endeavors to drive the planet around itself, but possesses an infinite number of degrees corresponding to the infinite number of points of the distance from A. Thus, just as AD is the longest, and AF the shortest, so the planet is slowest at D and fastest at F, and in general, as AD is to AE, so is the slowness at D to the slowness at E3, as will be demonstrated at great length in Part III below. The hypothesis attributes another motive power to the planet itself, which has the capacity to adjust its approach to and recession from the sun, either by the strength of the angles or by inspection of the increase or decrease of the solar diameter, and to make the difference between the mean distance and the longest and shortest equal to AB. Therefore, the point of the equant C is nothing but a geometrical short cut for computing the equations from a hypothesis that is clearly physical. But if the planet\\'s path is a perfect circle, as Ptolemy certainly thought, the planet also has to have some additional perception of the swiftness and slowness by which it is carried along by the other external power, in order to adjust its own approach and recession in such accord with the power\\'s precepts that the path DE itself is made to be a circle. It therefore needs both a comprehension of the circle and a desire to effect it. Also, the ratios of its own slowness and swiftness must differ from the gradations of the external power. However, if the demonstrations of astronomy, founded upon observations, should testify that the path of the planet is not quite circular, contrary to what this hypothesis asserts, then this physical account too will be constructed differently and the planet\\'s power will be freed from these rather troublesome requirements. But let me return to Copernicus. In avoiding the absurdity explained just above from his own opinions, he substituted another epicycle for the equant, in the following way. About center α with radius αβ equal to BD let the concentric βδ be described, so that the observer is at α; let αβ, parallel to BD, be extended in both directions; and let the angle βαδ be set up equal to DCE. Now let BC be bisected at I, and about the centers β and δ with radii βγ and δζ equal to AI let the first or greater epicycle be described, and let δζ be parallel to αβ. Next, about centers γ and ζ, but with radii γε, ζη equal to IC, let the second epicycle be described, and let its motion be eastward, with twice the speed of the motion of the first. And let the westward motion of the first epicycle be equal to the motion of the eccentric. And since γ is on αβ, let the planet be at ε, the point nearest β. And since βαδ is  right, let the planet be at η, the point farthest from the center of the greater epicycle δ. This particular hypothesis of Copernicus is also followed by Tycho Brahe religiously, in all particulars. Physically considered, this hypothesis is in any event valid if you grant solid orbs. However, if you remove these, as Brahe does with good reason, it says something practically impossible. For it attaches three movement- producing minds to a single planet; and besides, the other two [minds] will be thrown into confusion by the motion and impulse of one of them towards the body at α. For that any of them should pay heed to its own center, which is not distinguished by any body and is mobile besides, cannot be represented even in thought. Further, while Copernicus strives to outdo Ptolemy in the uniformity of motions, he is in turn outdone by him in the perfection of the planetary path. For, in Ptolemy, the planet bodily traces out a perfect circle in the aethereal air. Copernicus, on the other hand, says in Book V ch. 4 that for him the path of a planet is not circular, but goes outside the circular path at the sides. This is easily demonstrated in the present diagram. If from ε, the planet\\'s position at apogee, you extend the distance αβ, the semidiameter of the orb, to θ, and from θ draw θκ parallel to αδ, the circle εκ described about θ will indeed go through ε and the perigeal point opposite, but since it touches the straight line δη only at k, while the planet goes through η, it does not stay on the circle εκ, but strays outside this track. To this excursion of the planetary path from the perfection of the circle Ptolemy might well have objected against Copernicus, but I do not. For below, in Part IV, it will be demonstrated that by the agency of two physical powers, simple in capability, acting in concert to move the planet, it necessarily happens that the planet turns aside from the circle for a short time, though not by running outside of it, as in this Copernican hypothesis, but in the opposite direction, towards the center; that is, by making an incursion. Besides, should Copernicus retain that liberty he had of setting up the ratios of the epicycles, it can happen that the planet\\'s path would come out twisted, higher before and after apogee than at apogee itself, and lower before and after perigee than at perigee itself. This happened to Tycho in his lunar theory, inasmuch as he followed Copernicus. That these two forms of hypothesis are not simply equivalent, I shall demonstrate numerically. In the Ptolemaic form it can be computed more simply than Ptolemy did in the following manner. First, in triangle CBE, given the mean anomaly ECB or DCE, the side CB — the eccentricity of the equant—is also given, as well as the radius of the orb, BE. Therefore, as the radius of the orb is to the sine of ECB, so is CB to the sine of CEB. And since ECD is equal to the two opposite interior angles CEB and CBE taken together, therefore CEB subtracted from DCE leaves CBE. Therefore, in  triangle EBA, the angle at B is given, together with the sides about it. For BA is the eccentricity of the eccentric, while EB is the radius of the orb. Therefore, following the rule for this form of triangle, the angle BEA is given. But CEB was given before. Therefore, the whole equation CEA will be given. We shall now make use of numbers belonging to the motion of Mars. Although Ptolemy made CB and BA equal, Copernicus, freed from this rule, nonetheless also adopted other ratios, which Tycho Brahe undertook to imitate. Let CB be 7560, BA 12,600, where BE is 100,000; and, first, let DCE be 45°, whose sine is 70,711. Therefore, as 100,000 is to 70,711, so is 7560 to 5346, the sine of the arc of 3° 4\\' 52\", which is CEB. Subtracting this from 45° leaves CBE, 41° 55\\' 8\", whose half is 20° 57\\' 34\", the tangent to which arc is 38,304. And since EB is 100,000, while BA is 12,600, the difference, 87,400, multiplied by the radius and divided by the sum, 112,600, gives 77,620. Multiply this by the tangent found above (38,304). The product, that is, 29,732, is the tangent of the arc 16° 33\\' 30\", which, subtracted from the half of CBE, found above, leaves 4° 24\\' 4\", which is the angle BEA. Therefore, the whole, CEA, is 7° 28\\' 56\", in the Ptolemaic form. In the Copernican form, although the ordinary means of finding the equation is clearly presented in Tycho\\'s lunar tables in Vol. I of the Progymnasmata, and in Copernicus himself, let me nonetheless follow a different, less usual procedure, which is adapted to an anomaly of 45°. Let βαλ be 45°, and λν or βγ be 16,380, γε or νο be 3780, and ονλ be right, that is, twice βαλ. Now let νλ be parallel to βα, and let νλ and δα be extended, so as to meet at μ. From ο let οξ be dropped parallel to νμ. Therefore, λαμ is 45°, and consequently αμ, and also μλ, are 70,711. Add λν, 16,380, and μν or οξ will be 87,091. And because γε, νο, and ξμ are equal, subtract ξμ from αμ. The remainder, αξ, is 66,931. Therefore, as οξ is to ξα, so is the whole sine4 to the tangent of αοξ or οαβ, 76,852, giving an angle of 37° 32\\' 37\", which differs from the arc 45° by 7° 27\\' 23\". Therefore, the difference between the Copernican and the Ptolemaic equations at this position is 1\\' 33\", a very small difference indeed. Again in the Ptolemaic form, let DCE be 90°. Therefore, since ECB is right, and EB is 100,000, BC will be the sine of the angle CEB, or 4° 20\\' 8\". Therefore, EBC is 85° 39\\' 52\", and EC is 99,713. Now, as EC is to CA, so is the radius to the tangent of CEA, 20,218. Hence, the equation, CEA, is 11° 25\\' 48\". But in the Copernican form, the whole magnitude ηδ, equal to CA, becomes the tangent, because ηδα is right and δα is the radius. Therefore, ηαδ is 11° 23\\' 53\". The difference is 1’ 55”. Thus you see that, as far as the eccentric equation is concerned, there is something very slight lacking that prevents the two forms of hypothesis from being equivalent. They are different, however, in the distances of the planet from the observer at α, and as a consequence, in the annual equations of the center as well. For, in the Ptolemaic form, as the sine of the angle AEC is to AC, the whole sine is to AE, which becomes 101,766 when DCE is 90°. But in the  Copernican, ηα is the secant of angle ηαδ, that is, 102,012. The difference is 246 parts, and this can have a somewhat greater effect upon the equation of the center for the annual orb, as will be clear below in Part IV. We can eliminate even this extremely slight difference in the equations by positing 20,103 as Mars\\'s eccentricity in the Ptolemaic form where Brahe, in the Copernican form, found it to be 20,160. However, the distances in the Copernican form cannot be made equal to those in the Ptolemaic unless the equation be altered by 43\\'. In a certain equivalence I tried out in Tycho\\'s hypothesis of the lunar tables, I transposed those two Copernican epicycles into such a Ptolemaic eccentric with an equant point. Nevertheless, I added yet another epicycle on account of another inequality, peculiar to the moon. Finally, in accord with ch. 2, the greater epicycle with its concentric in the Copernican form can, by virtue of its complete equivalence, be transformed into an eccentric whose eccentricity is equal to the semidiameter of the greater epicycle. Therefore, when a smaller epicycle is added to this Copernican eccentric, an eccentric with an epicycle will be created which matches the double epicycle on a concentric to a hair, and which differs from the Ptolemaic eccentric with an equant by no more than does this double epicycle. Chapter 5 The extent to which this arrangement of orbs, using either an equant or a second epicycle, while remaining entirely one and the same (or very nearly one and the same), can present different phenomena at one and the same instant, according to whether the planets are observed at mean or at apparent opposition to the sun. This is done in two ways: one, in which the Ptolemaic and Copernican forms are equivalent, and another which is peculiar to the Copernican form. This latter, as it is further from our enterprise, we shall explain first, for it remains more allied to itself than the other. About center γ, with radius γδ, let an eccentric be described,  upon which, in the first instance, let αγ be the line of apsides, with α the observer, and let this line be extended to ε. And let γα be the magnitude of the eccentricity, or the radius of the greater Copernican epicycle (the equivalence of the two was discussed at the end of Ch. 4, preceding). Next, about center ε, with radius εη, let the smaller epicycle be described, and since its center is at ε, let the planet be at η, falling on the line εγ, so that it is not the star but the center of the epicycle bearing the star that runs along the eccentric εδ. Thus, by Ch. 4, it is the Copernican form that is expressed here. By Ch. 3, we shall set up another that is equivalent to it in reality or in the indication of the exact planetary path, but is different in appearance. This we shall do by moving the observer from α. By what was said at the end of Ch. 3, we could do the same thing even if the observer were to remain at α, by moving the eccentric while keeping lines parallel, in such a way that the size of the eccentric remains constant and only its position changes. But we shall carry it to completion as we have begun it. Adopting a position for the observer not on the prior line of apsides (let it be β), such that βγ has a magnitude different from that of αγ (that is, a new eccentricity or new radius of the greater epicycle), let us draw a new line of apsides βδ through βγ, and at δ let us describe an epicycle equal to the former. Here, although the center of the epicycle is at the apsis δ, nonetheless we shall not place the planet at the point nearest γ, as before, but, taking the measure of the angle εγδ, we shall set out the angle θδγ twice that size, in the direction of ε, and shall place the planet at θ, when the epicycle is at the apsis δ. For this is where the planet would be, were the observer at α and the epicycle at δ. In this way, the true compound planetary path remains the same to a hair’s breadth, while the appearance is altered. For when the lines of sight are inclined to one another, as βθ and αθ here, or βη and αη, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars. You may object that even when the lines of sight are parallel, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars, and it is therefore not essential that they be inclined to one another. I answer, this is indeed true, but in that case the space of the sphere of the stars intercepted between the two lines is not perceptible to the power of sight unless the distance between the parallels is perceptible in relation to the radius of the sphere of the stars. In the physical account, this must be posited in addition to what was said in Ch. 3, in order to establish the identity of the path while the appearances are altered: the mind to which the smaller epicycle is committed pays attention to a point on the circuit different from the one regarded by the mind of the greater epicycle. For in the second position, the greater epicycle or the eccentricity returns to its starting point on the line βδ, while the smaller epicycle does so on the line αε which does not pass through the place of the observer. This is because, in the second position, the observer is located at β, while in the first position, where the observer is located at α, both epicycles return to their starting points on the same line εα. The form of the hypothesis thus does not  remain simply the same physically in such a way that that the planet keeps the same path. But suppose you were going to simulate the same path in the second position by having both epicycles return to their starting point at the same line of apsides βδ. If so, while the eccentric as well as the epicycle stay the same in both instances, the position of the planet on the epicycle will be different at every single moment. Thus, although in the second instance the form of Ptolemaic hypothesis presented is the same to a hair’s breadth, the actual path of the planet will be altered. Hence, it will be inferred below, even though the first inequality of the planets may be entirely accounted for by the compound hypothesis of Ch. 4, it cannot happen that the first inequality have the same measure at the planet’s mean opposition to the sun as at apparent opposition, unless the planet’s orbit be moved from its own location at the same time (unlike the circles in the theory of the sun), or the Ptolemaic form of Ch. 4 be changed. Maestlin made use of this form of transposition in constructing the table in Ch. 15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum. For when Copernicus transformed the Ptolemaic [models] into his own general form of hypotheses, he supposed the observer to be stationed at some nearly motionless point near the sun, distant from the sun’s own body by the entire eccentricity of the solar orb. I, however, in adapting Copernicus to the subject matter of that book, needed a different fiction. The observer was to be imagined as transported from that point to the very center of the solar body, and from there (that is, from the body of the sun) the departures of the planetary bodies were to be computed, moving on the same path which the suppositions of Copernicus fashioned. But, as has just now been shown, by reason of the particular times my translation of the line of apsides did not effect exactly the same path. The difference, however, was very slight, and was clearly of no importance in that little book. For there the question concerned only the location of the path, which this procedure did not affect. As for the rest, in order to avoid confusion in what follows, I shall no longer make use of this Copernican eccentric, described by the center of the epicycle rather than the star. It differs from the planet\\'s true path, which is higher at perigee and lower at apogee. The term \"eccentric\"  from now on we will use only to designate the actual path of the planet, or of the point to whose motion the first inequality belongs. In proceeding in this way, it is appropriate that we imagine only the Ptolemaic eccentric, or something like it. For it was shown in the fourth chapter that our computation of the equation, based upon the Ptolemaic form, will differ from the Copernican by only two minutes at most. Then, too, the procedure for computing the first inequality is easier in the Ptolemaic form than in the Copernican. Finally, as was said, this Ptolemaic form of the first inequality is better accommodated to nature herself and to our speculations that follow in the third and fourth parts. However, because of the equivalence, anyone who so chooses will always be able to supply in thought  the Copernican eccentric-cum-epicycle considered so far in this fifth chapter. I now proceed to the prior procedure for setting up the two sorts of equivalence that I have proposed—the one common to the particular hypotheses of the authorities. I shall demonstrate this first in the Ptolemaic form. About center β let the Ptolemaic eccentric ιζη be described, with ιβ the line of apsides, α the observer, and γ the equalizing point ^1. Now when I say that the observer is at α, I mean it either as a fiction or as truth. Physically speaking, it is not so much the observer which is to be placed at α as the power which renders the planetary circuit around itself slow or swift according to the ratios of its proximity to α, as was said above. Let some point on the circumference not on the line of apsides (say, η) be connected with γ, β, and α. Let it be that about as many angles ιαη may be computed by this hypothesis throughout the entire circuit as are observed from α, and after certain periods of time, which the angle ηγι measures uniformly. Later, in the second part, it will be shown how one can find, through astronomical observations, how great the angle ηαι should be for any given ηγι. Again, let the observer or moving power be at some point not on the line ια, and let this be δ. Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about δ be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from δ. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at δ square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered. But since it is certain that at one and the same time the planet traverses one and the same path in the heavens, not one seen to an observer at δ and another to an observer at α, it is also certain, as a consequence, that the planet cannot appear to both observers (both the one at α and the one at δ) to be equally moved in the same time. For let ιη be a portion of the planet’s true path, and let the planet traverse this in a given time, say twenty days. Now since α is nearer ιη than δ is, ιη will appear greater at α than at δ, by what is demonstrated in optics. Therefore, during the same twenty days the planet will appear to make greater progress to one who is at α than to one who is at δ. And since any planet maintains a fixed and constant number of days in which it is returned to the same sidereal position, the slowness has to be compensated by a contrary speed. Therefore, since in the portion ιη the planet appears slower to one at δ, it will in some other portion appear swifter to the one at δ than to one at α. Hence it happens that it appears slowest to the one at δ in one place, and to one at α in another. Nevertheless,  the planet itself can be truly slowest in but one place on its orbit. With these as preliminaries, the question is raised whether one and the same true path of the planet in the heavens (this is presupposed) can present two sets of appearances each proper to an observer, one at δ and the other at α, and each such as comply with and admit the Ptolemaic form of computation. If the planet were of equal speed at all parts of its orbit, the answer, according to what was said in Ch. 3, is yes. But since in terms of real and true increment of time2 the planet is slowest at one point on the eccentric and fastest at the opposite point, the answer must therefore be, clearly not. The reason for this is that the two slowings are intermingled, one real and physical, occurring at one place on the eccentric, and the other optical and apparent and not occurring at a single place, but in the place most distant from whatever position is chosen for the observer. Now, when the observer α lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric β and the center of the equant γ on the side of β opposite the center of the equant γ, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position ι. But when the observer departs from this line, as at δ, then a straight line drawn from δ through the center of the circle β marks the place of the optical slowing, η, while the true and physical slowing is at ι. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between ι and η, as would be if a line were to be drawn from δ through γ to the point ζ. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which δβ were the line of apsides of the eccentric and βγ the line of the equant’s eccentricity, then even though the planet’s true path ιη remained the same, it would be represented differently at δ than at α. For to the observer at δ the planet would be slowest at ζ, and to the one at α it would be slowest at ι. But no such thing would be represented at δ that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above. For the forms of the hypotheses differ in that in the former, β is the midpoint between α and γ (as physical considerations require, if the moving power is in α), while in the latter the center of the eccentric β would not be the midpoint between δ and γ, nor would the line of the equant’s eccentricity pass through the observer δ, as before. Even if it did pass through δ, as δγ, it would not cut the eccentric into two equal parts, because it would not cut it at the center β, and it would not allow the planet to appear on one side fastest and on the other slowest, at opposite places. It is thus established that when a planet\\'s path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged. This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about δ, and how much this newly established hypothesis at δ will be at variance with the appearances as seen at α. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from γ to the line δβ, and βμ be made equal to βγ, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at η rather than ι. This  changes what cannot be changed in the planet’s path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observer’s viewpoint. Even though the planet would traverse the same path ιη in twenty days (which path appears greater at α and smaller at δ), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between ι and η. In particular, for the observer at α the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at δ, you will prevent the planet’s being slowest at ι; that is, if you transfer the equant from γ to μ. For if you draw a straight line through γμ to the point ν on the circumference and connect αν, this equation ανμ alone will be equal to the prior, ανγ. Above ν the equations about μ will be smaller, and below ν, greater. For example, at η the angle μνα is much less than γηα. But then what we proposed to do has not been done, for the prior form of hypothesis has not yet been quite established. For αβ is not to βγ as δβ is to βμ, since βμ is equal to βγ, while δβ is greater than αβ. But if, on the other hand, you make δβ be to βμ as αβ is to βγ, βμ will become greater than βγ. Whence it follows that for the observer at α, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity. Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness. It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from δ through the center of the eccentric β. And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point γ, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere. But what will happen if a new line of apsides be drawn from δ through the old equant point γ, and a new hypothesis of the same form as the old be set up? That is, if the center of the eccentric be transferred from β to the line δγ, and δθ be made to θγ as αβ is to βγ, θ thus being the center of the eccentric? Obviously, the result will be this: the path of the planet in the heavens does not remain entirely the same. About θ let the eccentric εκλ be described, equal to the previous one, and through θβ let a straight line be extended to the circumference, on one side to ξο and on the other to ρπ. Therefore, ξο and ρπ are both of the same magnitude as θβ, and the planet is this much closer to β at ο, and more remote at ρ, than it would have been had it traversed the previous eccentric. However, the planet is slowest in a different region, for previously the apsis was at ι, and now it is at k. Through this mutual tempering it is brought about that the observer previously stationed at α has his observations pretty much unchanged, which is the only thing sought for here. But now we shall prove it with numbers belonging to Mars’s motion, although Brahe recorded somewhat different ones. This should prove no impediment to us, since we are only performing a preliminary exercise3 here. Let the magnitudes on the line δγα be taken as follows: let δα be the quantity of the sun’s eccentricity, 3584; δγ the eccentricity of Mars, 30,138 of the same parts, and the angle αδγ 47° 59¼’, which is the angular difference between the sun’s and Mars’s apogees. Now, from these three given quantities, γα, Mars’s new eccentricity, will also be given, and will be 27,971, while the angle δγα is 5° 27’ 47”. On the supposition that the old apogee of Mars δγ is positioned at 23° 32\\' 16\" Leo, Mars’s new apogee αγ will fall at 29° 0’ 16” Leo. Now let βξ be 100,000 and αγ be 18,034 of the same parts. Before, it was 27,971, in units of which δγ was 30,138. Therefore, in these units, δγ will be 19,763. Next, let both be divided by the letters θ and β in such a ratio that δθ is to θγ, and αβ to βγ, as 1260 is to 756: δθ will be 12,352, θγ 7411; and αβ 11,271, βγ 6763. In this way, a Ptolemaic hypothesis for the first inequality may be set up about both δ and α. Then, in the former units, of which δα is 3584, θβ or οξ will be 1344, but in units of which βξ is 100,000, θβ or οξ will be 880. These should be kept in mind. To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at δ, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from ρθο to πβξ, we must proceed as follows. Since γ is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line γει indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric εο, it will at that moment be at ε with equation δεγ, but if it is traversing ιξ, it will be at ι with no equation, since the line of apparent motion αι coincides with the line of mean motion γι. Again, after a certain amount of time, whose measure shall be ιγζ or εγκ, whose vertical angle is δγα, just found to be 5° 27’ 47”, let a common moment be taken, represented by γκζ. At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric εo will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing ιξ will be at ζ with equation γζα. Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from γ, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at γ, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at ζ. But since in the present model the observer is placed at δ by the practitioners4 and at α by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at δ. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around οξ and ρπ). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at δ (just as it vanishes at ζκ and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below ξ and above ρ. Third, it must be close to δ (just as it is closer above ρ than below ξ, because the center of the other eccentric β lies off to the right of δ). If we construct a right angle to point γ of the line γδ, this perpendicular from γ to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let σφ be drawn through γ perpendicular to δγ, intersecting the eccentric about θ at σ and υ, and the other at τ and φ, and to this let the perpendicular βχ be dropped. Therefore, at the moment γσ the planet will be at σ and τ, and at the moment γφ, at υ and φ. First of all, the quantity υφ must be found. Let θυ and βφ be joined. In θυγ, θυ is given as 100,000, because θ is the center of the eccentric υ. The magnitude θγ is 7411, and  θγυ is right. Therefore, γυ is 99,725. The same is to be done in βγφ. But first, βχ5 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle βγχ, in which βχ is parallel to θγ, the angle at χ is right, and γβχ is equal to θγβ (5° 27’ 47”) and βγ is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: γχ 644, βχ 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle βχφ, since βφ is 100,000 (β being the center of the eccentric φ) and χβ is 6732, χφ will be 99,773. Add χγ, 644, and γφ is given, 100,417. But γυ was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, υφ, is 692. With υ and φ joined to the position of the observer δ, the magnitude of angle υφδ is found as follows. Above, δγ was 19,763 in the new units, and the angle at γ right. Therefore, as δγ is to γφ and γυ, so is the whole sine to the tangents of the angles γδφ and γδυ. These come out to be 78° 51’ 54” and 78° 47’ 30”. The difference of these angles, the angle υδφ, is 4’ 24”. The angle σδτ will be much less, because στ, as it is closer to the intersection of the eccentrics, is smaller than υφ. You see, then, how nearly the appearances remain unchanged for the observer at δ, despite the substitution of a new planetary path in the heavens by transposition of the observer and change of hypothesis. Moreover, it is still within the practitioner\\'s power to vary somewhat the mean motion and the ratio of the eccentricities both among themselves and in relation to the radius of the orb, should this become useful, for the purpose of obliterating this discrepancy of some five minutes. This equivalence pertains chiefly to the first inequality—that is, to the appearances at δ, close to the center of the eccentric. However, in the second inequality (the equation for the annual orb), it makes a big difference whether the planet goes around on ξπ or oρ, as was also noted above in the other equivalence. And there we could not ignore the 246 units (the difference between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican hypotheses). Much less can we overlook these 880 units, which are 1344 of the old units. In the next chapter we shall see how much of a difference in Mars’s apparent position this would occasion. Hitherto, we have transposed the observer from δ to α. Let it now be demonstrated that very nearly the same things happen if the observer remains fixed while the point of the equant is transposed. This we do to make it clear that the same thing can be done in this chapter with an eccentric that has an equant as could be done on a simple eccentric (at the end of Chapter 3 above). In the earlier case, the result was the same whether the observer or the center of the eccentric were transposed, while here, likewise, the result is almost the same whether the observer or the center of the equant be transposed. However, it necessary to adapt this demonstration to this divergence , on account of the great dissimilarity of the opinions followed by the practitioners in demonstrating the second inequality of the planets, which opinions will be keeping us in court in the next chapter. Let the points α and δ merge into one, so that the observer remain in the same place. Let δ, θ, and γ remain the same, but let the line γβα of the previous diagram be deleted, and replaced by ΑΒΓ parallel to it and passing through the point δ or Α. Let the segments ΑΒ, ΑΓ be equal to the previous segments αβ, αγ. Therefore, Γγ will be the transposition of the equalizing point γ, equal to the previous transposition of the observer αδ. Once more, two eccentrics or planetary paths through the aethereal air will be described, about Β and θ. All the letters on each circle will be carried over along with them, and the magnitudes of the lines will remain precisely the same. The only difference is that the two points on the two eccentrics at which the planet is to be placed at a given moment are no longer determined by a single line, but by parallel lines drawn from the two equant points Γ, γ, each extended to its own eccentric. For example, when the eccentric θκ has its planet at κ, the eccentric ΒΙ will have it at Ζ, where γκ and ΓΖ are parallel. And when the former has the planet at ε, the latter will have it at Ι, where γε and ΓΙ are again parallel. The rest is clear from the diagram without demonstration. Now, suppose it is not permissible to shift the observer (and it is not permitted by those who make the earth the center of the world, as will be remarked in the next chapter), and that the planet has been observed in several positions on the zodiac, always at opposition to the sun\\'s mean position, and that the practitioner will use the positions and the intervals of time between them to construct this sort of hypothesis, with the observer at δ, δθ the eccentricity of the eccentric θκ, θγ the eccentricity of the equant, and κ the apogee. Comes now Kepler, who would change the observed positions and times; that is, he would observe the moments and points at which the planet is at opposition to the apparent position of the sun rather  than its mean position. From these positions and times he will have come up with another hypothesis, in which the observer would be left unmoved at δ or Α, but where the eccentricity would come out to be ΑΒ in a new eccentric ΒΙ, and the eccentricity ΑΓ of a new equant Γ, and there would be a new apogee Ι. The question now is whether, if the prior practitioner combines the new eccentric ΒΙ with his original equalizing point γ, the computed equation and sidereal position of the planet will turn out much different from what he had formerly found using his eccentric γκ. (It is the first inequality that is in question; this discussion is not concerned with the second inequality, and the nature and magnitude of the changes which this procedure would effect therein.) The answer, arising from the equivalence of transpositions, is that the discrepancy will be extremely small. Its maximum, reached in the neighborhood of the points υ and Φ, will not exceed five minutes, exactly as before when the observer was transposed, except that now the line υΦ is closer to the observer δ than is its endpoint υ. Consequently, the angle υδΦ, which previously was 4’ 24”, is now 4’ 43”. The opposite happens at σΤ. It has thus been demonstrated in a Ptolemaic eccentric what sort of disturbances would arise if one should transpose either the observer or the orb and construct a new eccentric, making use of the planet’s oppositions to the sun’s apparent position. I do not think there is any need to repeat the arguments and demonstrate the same equivalence in the Copernican or Tychonic form, which makes use of two epicycles. I shall only show, by what was established at the end of Ch. 3, how to delineate both the eccentric-cum-equant that suits the planet, and its transformation into different magnitudes and different positions for the observer, in terms of the Copernican double epicycle. This is done in such a manner that, while the observer is transposed, the path of the planet through the aethereal air is invariant, as nearly as possible, in accord with what has been said in this fifth chapter. (This is exactly the possibility adumbrated in Ch. 3). Let the triangle δγα be constructed equal to the previous one, with corresponding lines parallel, and through α let αβ be drawn parallel to δγ, and through δ, δθ parallel to αγ. And about centers α, δ let two concentrics be described, equal to the previous eccentrics δθ, αβ. Let δγ be extended to ζ and λ, and αγ to ε and k, and let δζ and αε be semidiameters, as before, and lines of apsides (since both go through the same point γ). Now let δγ and αγ be cut at η and ξ in the same ratio as before, and let ηγ and ξγ be bisected at ψ and ω. Then, with radius δψ and upon centers θ and ζ let the epicycles ι and λ be described, and let ζλ be parallel to θι. Then, about centers ι and λ, with radius ψγ, let epicyclets be described through πμ and ρτ. Again, let the epicycles κ and o be described about centers ε and β with radius αω, and with βο parallel to εκ. Next, about centers κ and o with radius ωγ, let epicyclets be described through πυ and ρν, and let θιμ and βον be double δγα. Let  the planet on epicyclet κπ be at υ nearest ε, and the planet on epicyclet λρ be at ν nearest ζ. Therefore, according to the hypothesis deriving from δ the planet falls upon τμ, while according to the hypothesis deriving from α the planet falls upon νυ. Here you see that the points μ and υ, as well at τ and ν, hardly differ when seen from δ and α, respectively, when the planet is near the apsides. But around the middle intervals these points will be separated from each other only by the amount that separated υ and Φ in the previous diagram. The magnitudes will all be nearly equal and the demonstrations entirely the same. For if θι and εκ be extended to meet at π, and ζλ, βο to meet at ρ, the triangles θπε and ζρβ will be congruent to triangle δγα, and corresponding sides will be parallel. These demonstrations will be perplexing enough in themselves, so it is not really advisable to make them more involved by a heaping up of Copernican or Brahean epicycles. Therefore, in what follows, we shall decree that the Copernican or Brahean form count as belonging to the first inequality. For the procedure for treating the hypotheses of the second inequality, since it is always going to concern each of the three, will furnish us with a great abundance of things to do. I now immediately state it as a postulate that whatever we shall demonstrate using the Ptolemaic equant-cum-eccentric also be taken as demonstrated in the Copernican or Brahean concentric-cum-double-epicycle, or eccentrepicycle. For in Ch. 4 above, the difference was found to be very small. Chapter 6 On the equivalence of the hypotheses of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe, by which they demonstrated the second inequality of the planets, and how each one varies when accommodated to the sun’s apparent position and when accommodated to its mean position. The discussion so far has concerned the hypotheses of the planets’ first  inequality, which completes its cycle each time the planet returns to the same sign of the zodiac. Now we pass on to the other inequality, which completes its cycle not at a single constant sign of the zodiac but with the sun’s opposition to, or conjunction with, the planet. People have wondered exceedingly at this, different ones proposing different reasons why a planet in conjunction with the sun is made swift, direct, high, and small; and opposite the sun, retrograde, low, and large; while in between it becomes stationary and of a medium size. The Latin authors considered that in the sun’s aspects and rays there is a force by which the other planets are in fact attracted. Their opinion cannot be shown numerically, because it is not astronomical. But it is also improbable, now that the true causes have been found, and manifestly false, since Saturn begins to retrogress at quadrature with the sun, or beyond; Jupiter, at trine; Mars, at biquintile or before sequiquadrate, and all at variable distances ^1. Ptolemy said that at a determined point on the planetary circle that serves for the first inequality, there is fixed, not the planet itself, but the center of an epicycle bearing the planet fixed upon its circumference, which is in turn borne by the planet’s chief circle. The motion has the following form: if the center of the epicycle be in conjunction with the sun, the planet is also at the highest point of the epicycle and is moved along with the sun in the same direction, [and] when the sun, which is faster, departs from the center of this epicycle, the planet simultaneously descends on the epicycle. But since the epicycle’s motion about its center is faster than the motion of its center about the earth, it hence happens that when the planet traverses the lower parts of the epicycle while the epicycle’s center is at opposition to the sun, the compounding of motions makes it actually retrograde. Thus Ptolemy made his opinions correspond to the data and to geometry, and has failed to sustain our admiration. For we still seek the cause that connects all the epicycles of the planets to the sun, so that they always complete their periods when their centers are in conjunction with the sun. Copernicus, with the most ancient Pythagoreans and Aristarchus, and I along with them, say that this second inequality does not belong to the planet’s own motion, but only appears to do so, and is really a by-product of the earth’s annual wheeling around the motionless sun. In this way, just as in Ch. 1 the diurnal motion was separated from the motion proper to the planets, the second inequality of the planets is likewise now separated from the first by Copernicus, and in quite the same way. For some practitioners admit that the first motion is extrinsic to the planets, but still think it is in fact in the planets, inserted into them, so that the planets, too, are moved with the same motion. Copernicus holds that it is neither intrinsic to the planets nor inserted, but only attached to them through an optical illusion. For while the earth rotates upon its axis from west to east, it appears to our eyes that the rest of the world rotates from east to west. It is, I claim, in just the same way that Copernicus asserts that the planets do not really become stationary and retrograde, but  only appear so. For he says that since the earth is in addition carried along by another motion, which is annual, in a very large circle (which he calls the orbis magnus), those who believe that the earth is at rest think that the planets and the sun are carried in the opposite direction; and he says that when the sun is between the planet and the earth, in the appearance the motions of the earth and the planet in are added, whence the planet appears to be swift; and when, on the other hand, the earth is between the sun and the planet, the planet is apparently left behind and thus retrogresses, owing to the earth’s being swifter than the planet. Tycho Brahe holds something in common with the Latins: although the sun does indeed not attract the planets through the aspect, the planets do fawn upon the sun. For he says that they strive to keep the sun (although it is moving) nearly in the middle of their circuits, and indeed, that they arrange their real paths around the sun as if it were motionless. Thus any given planet, besides its own path, traverses the sun’s path in the aethereal air, and out of these motions compounded with one another there is produced exactly what Ptolemy had (that is, a spiral), as described in Ch. 1. In astronomical terms, Ptolemy put epicycles on eccentrics, while Brahe put eccentrics on a single epicycle, which is the sun’s orb itself. I, in the demonstrations that follow, shall link together all three authors’ forms. For Tycho, too, whenever I suggested this, answered that he was about to do this on his own initiative even if I had kept silent (and he would have done it had he survived), and on his death bed asked me, whom he knew to be of the Copernican persuasion, that I demonstrate everything in his hypothesis. Furthermore, we shall demonstrate, both right here and through the entire book (though while doing other things), that these three forms are absolutely, perfectly, geometrically equivalent. For the present we must carry out what we set out for ourselves and what is to be demonstrated, namely, that there is a very great error indeed in the second inequality if the apparent position of the sun is replaced by its mean position, to which the planet is at opposition at the beginning of this second inequality. I shall begin with the Copernican opinion ^2. About center β let the earth’s eccentric γυ be described, such as Copernicus, putting his trust in Ptolemy, imagined. Let γβ be its line of apsides, κ the position of the motionless sun, and β the point about which the earth’s motion is uniform. Through β and perpendicular to βγ let υβσ be drawn, intersecting the circumference at points υ and σ, and let υ and σ be joined to κ. Copernicus, intending to transfer the Ptolemaic numbers into his own form of hypothesis, reckoned the eccentricities of the planets from the conjectural center β of the earth’s uniform motion rather than from the sun κ. For if lines be drawn from β (as βγ, βυ, βσ), whenever a planet and the earth lie upon one of these, the planet was supposed to shed the second inequality, to which it was subject on account of the earth’s motion, as, for example, if the earth were at υ and the planet were found on βυ extended. In effect, by adopting this procedure, Copernicus established a fictitious  observer at the point β. For provided that the planet is on the line βυ, it makes no difference for the purpose of designating its sidereal position whether it be viewed from σ or from β. The same may be truly said of the lines βγ, βσ, and all the other infinite lines intersecting at β. Therefore, β is the point of intersection of all the lines of vision, and is thus the fictitious common point for all observers. In fact, however, the point of vision is the earth, our home, which is found at one or another point on the circle σγυ at various times. So Copernicus believed the planet was freed from the second inequality whenever the planet and the earth were found on any one line passing through β. Consequently, he endeavored to find the apparent sidereal position of a planet at those moments of opposition to the mean position of the sun through mathematical instruments. For if the planet’s position was found on one of the nights near the planet’s opposition to the sun, and if at that time the mean position of the sun was found by calculation to be at the point precisely opposite, then that was the moment of time desired. However, if there was still a little distance between them on that night, then he tracked down this moment of time, and the point or position held by the planet at this moment, by a comparison of two or more nights and of the diurnal motions of Mars and the earth over the interval. When he had done this as many times and in as many places  on the zodiac as he thought necessary (suppose, for example, βγ, βυ, βσ), the practitioner now began to use these known sidereal or zodiacal positions of the planet, βγ, βυ, βσ, to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality. This involved finding the magnitude of the planetary circle\\'s eccentricity from the selected point β, and the parts of the zodiac into which the apogee points, by comparing the angles which the observed positions set up about the point of observation β, with the time intervals between them. The method of this undertaking, however, I shall present clearly in its proper place, below. Suppose these things already done, giving a line of apsides βδ, eccentricity of the equant point βδ, and the center of the eccentric on this line at the point λ, and let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the moment of opposition to the sun’s mean position. Now, Kepler, what more could you ask of Copernicus? Are you denying that this hypothesis corresponds entirely to observations or to astronomers’ experience?3 That is indeed not in question at present. Nor was I, when I first entered upon this undertaking, tempted by the observations to take up a different opinion. But it is this that I have been wanting: Let βδ be extended so as to intersect the eccentric at χ and ξ, and near χ let some point τ on the eccentric be chosen, and lines be drawn from τ to δ and λ. Now χτ is the measure of the angle χλτ, while the angle χδτ is greater than the angle χλτ by the amount δτλ, and δ is the point of temporal uniformity ^4. Therefore, the time designated by χδτ is greater, with respect to the whole periodic time designated by four right angles, than is the arc  χτ with respect to the whole circumference. The planet, then, is actually slower over the arc τχ (this is not just an optical illusion), and fast over the opposite arc; and at χ it is slowest, and at ξ it is fastest. Nevertheless, it is not farthest from the sun κ when it is at χ, nor is it nearest κ at ζ. But by all the arguments, even the testimony of the very hypothesis set up upon β which I am refuting, it is fitting that this real slowing down of the planet arises from its moving away from the body of the sun, and the speeding up from its approach to the sun itself, seated at κ. On the other hand, it is impossible even to conceive of how a force could inhere in point β, which has no body, rather than in k, quite nearby, in which there is the sun, the heart of the world, which force would drive the planet around more swiftly or slowly according to its approach and recess. Furthermore, even if one who is not prepared to admit that the slowings and quickenings arise physically from the close interconnection of the eccentrics, should consequently assert that these affects of motion are naturally under the control of the motive faculties residing in the body of the planet, we will again maintain the same probable conclusion. For what would be the reason why those minds would bypass the point κ (which has a geometrical affinity for motion, being invested with a body of no small magnitude) and pay attention to the point β, only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities)5 of the solar body distant from the sun, empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone? Even Copernicus himself admits, in Book 5 Ch. 16, that the sun is really fixed at κ, wherefore the eccentricity δκ is constant, while he holds that the point β, which he takes as the center of the annual orb, is displaced over the ages, thus making βδ shorter. Thus either β is no longer in the center of the world today, or it was previously not there. But it is probable either that the motion originates from the center of the world, or that the moving minds pay attention to the center of the world, and thus not to β but to κ, which Copernicus says is fixed, as the center of the world should be. Led by these probable arguments, I concluded that the line of apsides taken in order to produce the planet’s first inequality, ought to go right through κ itself rather than β. But we shall obtain this result when we make use of the sidereal positions which the planet has at the moment when the sun’s apparent position and its own are opposite. And when the points κ and β are collinear with the earth γ, and when the planet itself falls on the same line at the same time, as at τ, it is at the same moment at opposition to both the sun’s mean position and its apparent position. Its position is the same whether it be designated by βτ or by κτ extended out to the fixed stars, and the planet is truly stripped of its second inequality, whether it depends upon the earth’s apparent position or its mean position. But when the earth comes to the side of its eccentric, or rather the middle intervals,6 a fairly large difference arises between them. For let the earth have traveled from γ to υ (that is, let the sun, directly opposite, have moved from perigee in Capricorn to Aries), and let the line of the sun’s mean position υβ be found in Aries, while the line upon which the planet is observed in Libra be exactly opposite, namely, υω. Now since υκ is farther eastward beyond υβ, the sun’s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And since υ is the observer’s home, the earth, and ω is the planet, and both are going down towards ξ, the earth υ more swiftly, the line υω will at a later time be still more inclined to the line of the  sun’s visible position υκ. Therefore the apparent opposition precedes the mean. So, at a time preceding the moment designated by βυ (call it βθ), the planet will fall upon a line drawn from κ through θ, that is, at ζ. And then the planet’s line of vision θζ (as the less experienced should diligently note) lies farther eastward beneath the fixed stars than the line υω of the later time. This is because, although θζ precedes the line υω in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if θ, υ, and absolutely all points on the earth’s circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars. Therefore, it is not the distance of the endpoints θ and υ but the inclination of the lines θζ and υω that causes the lines to strike upon different zodiacal positions, since they would be perceived as coinciding if they were parallel. But that ζ is inclined towards ω is clear from the supposition that the planet is moved from ζ to ω in the same time that the earth is moved from θ to υ. For the earth is swifter than the planet. Therefore, the earth traverses a greater space θυ than does the planet along ζω. But it can be shown even more easily that at an earlier time the planet is farther east, since at opposition it is retrograde, as is clear to everyone. It is therefore clear what is altered in the positions stripped of the second inequality, in this transition from the mean to the apparent positions of the sun. For, at τ and the point opposite, the original positions remain; αt ζ οr ω an addition is made to the observed position, since θζ (as was said) is farther eastward than υω. A subtraction is made in the intervening time, because θζ is the line of vision at an earlier time than is υω. At the opposite position the outcome is the contrary, that is, an addition is made to the time and a subtraction from the position. Accordingly, these positions of the planet differ considerably from the original ones. And therefore, the operation set up in this new way produces quite different results. That is, since we have transferred the fictitious point of observation to the sun κ (by virtue of our having viewed the planet when it was at τ and ζ and the earth was on the lines κτ and κζ, namely, at the points γ and θ), the eccentricity will now originate at the point κ. But in Ch. 5 above, it was shown that when the observer is shifted from β to κ and a line is drawn from κ through the original point of uniformity δ, although this new hypothesis does result in a new eccentric, it is one that, for the observer at β, leaves nearly all his appearances undisturbed. So, by joining δκ, dividing it at μ so that δλ is to δμ as δβ is to δκ, tracing out a new eccentric ηε about μ equal to the previous one ξχ, and drawing a new line of apsides through κδ, a new hypothesis will be formed, whose apsis is at η. Previously, however, we had improperly called χ the apogee, because the Copernican center β on the line χβ was the successor to the Ptolemaic position of the earth. Now, following my own notions, we shall call η the aphelion (since we are in the Copernican hypothesis), and the  point opposite it perihelion, because the sun’s distance from η is a maximum ^7. It has been said how this pair of opinions, mine and those of the authorities, differ as regards physics. It has also been shown how each is to be constructed geometrically in the Copernican form. Third, it has been driven home that in astronomical terms those opinions8 do not differ in any important way at the moments of conjunction and opposition9. The next thing for me to do is to demonstrate what remained unexplained in Ch. 5 above, that there is a considerable difference between the two hypotheses if you are required to use  them to compute the planet’s position outside the acronychal location ^10. If a line be drawn through the centers of the eccentrics λ, μ, parallel to βκ, and extended to intersect each eccentric in two points, above and below, there will be set up, below, the maximum space ερ between the two, equal to λμ. But because it is lines from δ, not those from λ, that designate certain unchanged moments of time, which is what we need here, let δρ be drawn intersecting the eccentrics at ε and ρ, so that at one and the same moment the planet on one might be at ε and on the other at ρ. When the earth is on the line δρ, at π, the planet, whether it is at ε or ρ, will in either case be seen at the same place on the zodiac. For, optically considered, the line ερ appears as a point. But when the earth departs towards either side of this line, the magnitude of the line ερ appears greater and greater, since it is viewed obliquely. It is required to find the point on the earth’s orb from which the lines of vision passing through ε and through ρ are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at ρ when it should have been placed at ε. First, the angle will be greater down at ε than up near τ because the earth’s orbit, described about β, moves the observer nearer to ερ than to τ. Next, since δρ is beyond τβ, ερ is seen more obliquely from the left side than from the right. It will consequently appear less at the former place than at the latter even when the distances of the earth from the line δρ are equal. Therefore, the point we are to find is on the right side. I say  that ερ subtends a maximum angle of vision when the observer is stationed at the point where a circle drawn through ε and ρ is tangent to the earth’s circle. For let such a circle be described through ερ tangent to the circle υσ on the side towards σ, and let the point of tangency be ν. From ε and ρ let lines extend both to the tangent point ν and to several other points of circle υσ before and after the point of contact. Now since circles touch one another in one and only one point, the sides of all angles extending from ε and ρ and meeting with points on circle υσ will therefore be cut by the circle through ερ, with the exception of those that terminate at the tangent point of the circles, ν. But the sides from ε and ρ that are cut by the circle ερ before they intersect would form a greater angle had they intersected at either of the points of section,11 by Euclid’s Elements I. 21. And by Euclid III. 21, all angles at the circumference set up on segment ερ are equal. Therefore, the one at ν (the point of contact) is greater than all the others. q.e.d. Next, to investigate its magnitude in appropriate numbers, we need to find ερ and also the perpendicular from β to δρ. We shall find both by solution of the triangles δλρ and δμε. Now we said above12 that in δλρ, δλ is 741113 where λρ is 100,000, and ρλβ is 47° 59’ 16”. This gives ρδλ a value of 44° 59’ 10”, and δρ 105,123. Therefore, in εδμ, since εδλ is 44° 59’ 10”, and λδμ earlier came out to be 5° 27’ 47”, the whole εδμ is 50° 26’ 57”, and δμ above was 6763 where με is 100,000. Therefore, in εδμ, with three magnitudes  given the rest are given: εμκ is 53° 26’ 17”, and through this, δε is 104,170. But earlier, δρ was 105,123. Therefore, the remainder, ερ, is 953. Above, λμ was 880, to which ερ would be equal were ε and p on the line μρ. But because here ε is on the line δρ which is inclined to μρ, you should not be surprised that ερ is longer than μλ14. Now let βι be drawn from β perpendicular to δρ. In triangle δβι, the angle at ι is right, and βδι is 44° 59’ 10”, and βδ was found to be 19,763, above. Therefore, the required perpendicular, βι, is 13,971, and δι is 13,978. Consequently, ιρ is 91,145. It is also necessary to figure out the quantity of the radius βυ in the same units. Above, when the line corresponding to the present βκ was taken to be 3584 parts, βυ was assumed as 100,000. Now, however, λρ is assumed as 100,000, and λρ is to βυ (taken above) as approximately 61 to 40, whence the other ratios are extrapolated. Thus 60 is to 41 as 100,000 is to 65,656½, the appropriate magnitude for βυ. Next, let a circle passing through ε and ρ touch the circle βυ at point ν, and, ερ being bisected at ο, let ψο be set up perpendicular to ιρ, and βν be extended so as to intersect οψ at ψ. The center of the circle will be ψ. For the center of the circle is on the line passing through the center of one of the tangent circles and the point of tangency, by Euclid III. 11: hence, it is on the line βψ. Again, by Euclid III. 3, the center of the circle is on the perpendicular bisector of the chord ερ, which connects the points of intersection ε and ρ. Therefore, the center is on the line οψ, and hence is at the point ψ common to the two lines. Let εψ be joined, and from β parallel to ιρ let βα be drawn intersecting oψ at α. Therefore, βα is equal to ιο, and αο is equal to βι. But βι was just found to be 13,971, while ιο is known through ιρ and ερ. And ιρ, above, was 91,145, and ερ was 953. But ορ is half of ερ, and therefore, ορ is 476½. So, when ορ is subtracted from ιρ, the remainder ιο or βα is 90,668. Now since α is a right angle, βψ is the power15 of the two, βα, αψ. However, βψ is composed of βν, which is known (65,656), and νψ. But because ο is a right angle, νψ, that is, εψ, is the power of the known οε (476½) and oψ which is composed of the known οα and αψ, which is unknown but was also noted previously. Therefore, οψ must be made long enough that when you add the powers of ψο and οε, the side εψ or ψν will be just so long that when the power of the sum of βν and νψ is diminished by the power of βα, it leaves the power of ψα of such a magnitude that when it is compounded with αο the sum is equal to οψ that was taken at the beginning ^16. I take ψο as a figured unit [x]. Its square will also be a figured unit [x2]. Add the square on εο, 227,052, and the sum of the two will be the square of ψε or ψν. But the square of βν is 4,310,747,475. If you add this to the square of ψν and complete the rectangle, the result will be the square of the whole ψβ. Then each rectangle is the root of 4,310,747,475x2 + 978,763,835,536,363. And thus the square on βψ is obtained for the first time ^17. 18 Now since αο is 13,971, ψα will be represented by the figured unit diminished by 13,971. Its square will be x2 - 27,942x + 195,188,841. Add to this the square of βα, 8,220,686,224, so that the square on βψ may be established for a second time: [βψ2 =]x2-27,942x+8,415,875,065. Previously it was x2+4,310,974,527 augmented by double the root of 4,310,747,475x2+978,763,835,536,363. Subtract x2 from both, and also 4,310,974,529. In the former, the remainder will be\\n—27,942x+4,104,900,538, and in the latter, twice the root of 4,310,747,475x2 + 978,763,835,536,363,\\nand these are equal. Therefore, the simple root in the former is equal to —13,971x + 2,052,450,269. And since this is equal to the latter’s root, its square will be equal to the quantity itself. This square is +195,188,841x2-57,349,565,416,398x+4,212,552,106,718,172,361. Subtract from each 195,188,841x2 and 978,763,835,536,363, and add to each 57,349,565,416,398x. The two will remain equal, the former being 4,115,558,634x2+57,349,565,416,398x, while the latter, 4,211,573,342,882,635,998. In least terms, x2+13,934x is equal to 1,023,329,690. Solving the equation gives the figured unit οψ the value of 25,772. Now that the semidiameter of the circle is known, the angles are easily obtained. From ψο subtract οα, 13,971. The remainder, ψα, will be 11,801. And βα is 90,668½, and βαψ is right. Therefore, αβψ is 7° 30’ 10”. But above, αβ or ρδ were inclined to ρλ or βκ by 3° 0’ 6”, which latter lies at 5½˚ Cancer. Therefore, ρι or αβ will be at 8½° Cancer, and ψβ is consequently at 16° Cancer. Therefore (assuming these numbers), when the sun is passing through 16° Cancer while the planet is at 8½° Capricorn in its mean and uniform motion, and in the neighborhood of 27° Scorpio in its apparent motion, ερ appears maximum. If the planet is beyond 8½˚ Capricorn, that is, beyond ρε, even though ρε is then diminished, its apparent size can increase when viewed from a point beyond ν owing to the greater nearness of the orbs. This apparent size is now immediately obtained. For since οψ was found to be 25,772, and ορ 476½, οψε will be 1° 3’ 32” But ρνε  (which is what we have been seeking) is equal to οψε, by Euclid III. 20. This is because the whole angle at the center ρψε is twice the angle at the circumference ρνε, and at the same time οψε is half of ρψε. But if βδ and κδ be bisected [at λ and μ], and λμ were to be taken as half βκ (on which more will be said below), then ρε, and consequently its angle at ν as well, could possibly become greater by one fourth. So, at last, you see how much my transposition of the hypothesis from the mean to the apparent position of the sun creates a disturbance in the annual parallax. Therefore, by the observations as well, a door has opened for us to determine what I had deduced a priori by consideration of moving causes: that the planet’s line of apsides, which is the only line bisecting the planet’s path into two semicircles equal both in size and in vigor—this line, I say, does not (as the practitioners have it) pass through some point other than the sun, but right through the center of the solar body. In the conclusion of the work I shall demonstrate this by means of observations, in Parts IV and V. Now, to the extent that this is possible, I shall deduce the same things in the Ptolemaic hypothesis. About center Ψ let the eccentric of the sun Γ be described, upon which let ΨΓ be the line of apsides, with the motionless earth at point Κ of the line ΨΓ on the side nearest Γ, and Ψ be the point about which the sun’s motion is reckoned as being uniform. From Ψ and Κ let the perpendiculars ΨΣ and ΚΥ be set up, and let ΣΚ be joined. Let ΚΣ be the line of the sun’s apparent motion, and ΚΥ the line of the sun’s uniform  motion. Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines ΚΣ, but on the lines ΚΥ drawn from Κ parallel to the lines ΨΣ passing through the sun’s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines ΚΥ on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy’s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet’s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, ΚΓ, ΚΥ, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about Κ, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric\\'s line of apsides come out to be ΚΛΔΧ, with Δ the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point Λ, and the eccentric ΧΖ. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet’s opposition to the sun’s mean position. Here, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth Κ, performed on the circle ΧΖ. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth Κ (just as there was before in Copernicus’s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe’s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle’s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet\\'s body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet’s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another\\'s motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. But something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point Υ (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked Σ, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun\\'s body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of Υ around the earth K, since there is no body at Ψ? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines ΚΣ of the sun’s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle? Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun’s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun Γ, the center of the sun’s eccentric Ψ, and the earth Κ are on the same line, so that the line of the sun’s apparent position ΨΓ and the line of its mean position ΚΓ coincide, then for the center of the epicycle Τ this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by ΚΤ or by ΨΤ, and the planet is really on the line ΚΤ or ΨΤ and at the lowest point on its epicycle Φ, since here it is nearest to both Ψ and Κ. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from Γ to Σ, and the line of the sun’s mean position ΚΥ be found in Aries, and the planet’s line of vision ΚΩ precisely opposite in Libra, so that ΥΚΩ is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet Ω on this line of vision ΚΩ is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle Ζ on the line ΚΩ. But since ΚΣ has gone beyond ΚΥ, the sun’s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, ΚΩ is not descending, so as to be opposite ΚΣ, but ascends towards ΚΦ, because the lowest parts of the epicycle Ω are retrograde and swifter than the center Ζ, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one. Therefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by ΚΥ (let it be ΚΘ) when the sun is seen on the line ΚΞ, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at Ι) on ΚΙ which forms a straight line with ΚΞ. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line ΞΚ, say at Ο. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time ΚΘ prior to ΚΥ the planet is on the line ΚΙ later than at ΚΩ. But ΚΙ and ΚΩ are parts of the lines ΚΟ and ΚΖ. Therefore, ΚΟ too is more to the east than ΚΖ. Thus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle’s center by this restoration from the sun’s mean position to its apparent position. For at Τ and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle’s center remain unchanged. At Ζ this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant ΒΖ of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from Χ towards Ζ.\\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet Ω falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle Ζ through the earth Κ, only when ΚΖ is collinear with ΚΣ, the sun’s apparent position. Therefore, ΚΣ and the line drawn from Ζ through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun’s mean position was ΚΥ, drawn through Ω, the planet was observed on the line ΚΩ, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle Ζ is on ΚΩ at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet’s position Ω parallel to ΚΣ, and let this be ΩΟ. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line ΩΟ, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as Ω (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from Κ on the line ΚΖ. Let ΩΟ be drawn from whatever point on the line ΚΖ (now, it is Ω), equal to ΩΖ. From Ο let a line be drawn to ΖΚ parallel to ΚΨ, and let this be ΟΖ. Now since ΖΩΟ is equal to ΚΣΨ, and ΚΣ is imperceptibly greater than ΨΣ  or ΩΟ (because ΚΨΣ is right, and the angle at Σ is not greater than 2° 3’, so that if ΨΣ is 100,000, ΚΣ is 100,064), ΟΖ is also imperceptibly less than ΚΨ. Let ΖΔ be joined, and let a line be drawn at Ο parallel to ΖΔ. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at Ζ by Ptolemy and at Ο by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line ΚΥ in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by ΖΔ, because Δ is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to ΖΔ. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through Ο. Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy\\'s account) is at the other end of the line of the sun’s mean position in the neighborhood of ΚΥ (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove). Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line ΔΔ drawn from Δ to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to ΖΟ or ΨΚ, equal to ΖΟ, and very nearly equal to ΨΚ, and the new Δ will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis. But at the end of Ch. 5 above, it was shown that if through Δ a line ΔΔ be drawn parallel to ΚΨ, ΚΨ being equal to ΔΔ, and if the new Δ be joined to Κ, and the new line ΚΔ be cut at Μ in the same ratio in which the previous ΚΔ was cut at Δ, then by this new hypothesis a new eccentric is constructed, that is, one having a different position from the former, which even if applied in the prior hypothesis would still leave all the appearances to an observer at Κ very nearly undisturbed. Let such a new eccentric be described about Μ, equal to the former, and let ΚΜ be extended in both directions. The new apogee will be Η, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points Β, Ο, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at Α and farther at Ι than before. However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis. (This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sun’s eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicus’s and Tycho’s discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.) The reason is not that the point of equality Δ does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sun’s apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval ΛΜ. Also, from this distance of the centers there necessarily follows an equal distance of the positions of the planetary body. Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sun’s middle distances. For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from ΔΔ. It is therefore greatest near the sun’s apsides, and greater near perigee on ΜΛ extended so as to intersect the eccentrics at Ρ and Ε. For ΡΕ is of the same magnitude as ΜΛ. But this one line ΜΛ does not designate the same moment, since it is not Μ or Λ that is the point of equality, but Δ. Therefore, let parallels be drawn from ΔΔ towards Ρ and Ε, which shall designate the same moment, and let them be ΔΡ and ΔΕ. Also, let the epicycles Ν and Π be described about Ρ and Ε. The question now is, where would this discrepancy appear greatest, in terms of the circumference of the epicycle? It is certain that this does not occur at the parts of the epicycle nearest Κ, the earth, because these parts would be in the same direction as Κ, nor at the highest parts of the epicycle, because they would be too far away. Therefore, this will occur at the parts of the epicycle near perigee, therefore when the sun, and the planet with it, are not exactly at perigee but nearby: namely (to put it briefly) at the points Ν and Π corresponding to the same moment of time, such that the small circle through them and Κ is a minimum. The center of this small circle is, moreover, on the line through Κ which, extended upward and meeting ΡΔ likewise extended, makes an angle of 7½ degrees. Let anyone who disagrees with this adapt the previous demonstration to the present conditions. The numbers are just the same, except for Ptolemy ΜΛ is greater than μλ, in the numbers taken above. For this reason, the difference in apparent  position, ΝΚΠ, is also greater. For previously, βκ was to λμ as δβ was to δλ, which is less than half δβ. To Ptolemy, ΔΔ\\n(equal to βκ) would be to ΜΛ as the whole ΚΔ is to the half, ΚΛ. Finally, I shall deduce the same things in the Tychonic hypothesis. About center B let the solar eccentric GS be described, with line of apsides BG, C the position of the immobile earth, and B the point of equality, following the opinion of the authorities. For it will be shown in due course that the point of equality and the center of the eccentric are not the same in the theory of the sun. Upon BC let the perpendiculars BS and CV be erected, and let SC be joined, so that CV may be the line of the sun’s mean position, and CS, of its apparent position. Now, although Tycho Brahe had never finally decided whether to refer the planets to the lines CV, or to CS instead, in his initial conception he used the lines CV, according to the explanation he left in the Progymnasmata, vol. I p. 477 and vol. II p. 188. This is the way shown him by the footprints of Ptolemy and Copernicus. Of this path trodden by Tycho (if we proceed on it with Ptolemy’s views), it should be said that whenever a planet is on one of the lines of the sun’s mean position CV, on the side opposite the sun, the planet is divested of its second inequality, which, in Brahe’s opinion, is applied to it on account of the motion of the center of the eccentric around the earth in the same time as the sun does so. This common point, with respect to which all the planets are said to perform their eccentric motion, and at which the whole planetary system is  conceived as being attached to the sun’s orbit—this point, I say, is always on the line of the sun’s mean position, distant from the earth C by a constant distance BS, and describing a concentric V equal to the eccentric GS. This was Tycho Brahe’s opinion—except that he denied solid orbs. So what we said about the attachment of the whole system to the sun’s orbit, we said to win over those who believe in solid orbs. Let VC be extended, and let the planet be on that line beyond C. In this configuration, Brahe will place the point at which the planetary system is attached at V. The planet will be observed on the line VC. So, even though the observer is on the earth, C, it is exactly as if he were at V, the point upon which the first inequality depends. Next, let the planet’s sidereal position be taken with instruments whenever it shall be seen at some point on the line CV opposite V beyond C (let this be on the lines CV, CG, and points opposite). Thus the center of the planetary system will be on the circle VP, the sun at S and G, and the body of the planet opposite it at O and F. (Nevertheless, in the theory of Mars, the planet’s eccentric is so small in proportion to the sun’s eccentric that Mars’s eccentric and the points O and F are nearer to the earth C than is the sun S, which was one of the reasons why Brahe denied the solidity of the orbs.) From many positions of this sort, as many, in fact, as he could obtain, Tycho Brahe used to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality, by removing the magnitude of the orb VP and treating it as a single point, as though in the meanwhile the center VP of the planetary  system, the point at which the system is attached, had remained at rest. So he set up a comparison of the elapsed times with the angles which VO and PF, drawn from a single point (V and P coinciding), would form. These are in fact identical to the angles OCF and VCP. Suppose this treatment done, and let the line of apsides of the eccentric come out to be VLD or PLD, D the equalizing point, L the center of the eccentric on this line, and the eccentric HO and FH. Let this hypothesis correspond to all positions of the planet observed at the moment of the planet\\'s opposition to the sun’s mean position. For the present, I am postponing a more careful examination of whether this sort of hypothesis is in accord with physical principles—a hypothesis, that is, in which the sun, through its motive mind paying attention to the earth, moves around the earth, and of itself (since it lacks an orb) drives itself forward nonuniformly according to its approach to or recession from the earth (unless you would make the earth more important than the sun and ascribe to the earth the sun\\'s motive force); while this same sun (as in Copernicus) sends out a motive force to all the planets, sweeping them around itself with a degree of speed corresponding to their degree of nearness to the sun; the planets meanwhile striving to accomplish their approach to and recession from the sun on a small epicycle, and at the same time to follow the sun, wherever it is supposed to be, in those same tracks not proper to them; and thus any planet, and most of all the sun, attends to many things at once, and the actual trajectories of the planets through the aethereal air (as with Ptolemy) make spirals, such as were depicted in Ch. 1. Whether, I say, these are fitting, we shall consider elsewhere when the occasion arises. Here, let this form of hypothesis be supposed true in its general features. The question is, whether it is also fitting, in particular, that the planets follow the sun’s body S, G, or whether they instead follow the point V, P, void of any body, four solar semidiameters (no more) from the center of the sun, which is now above the sun and now below, now before and now behind. And further, whether it is more fitting that the force that drives the planets in an orb around the sun make its nest in the body of the sun S, G, or in some other point such as VP void of body. In brief:  if the axle [axis] (to derive the sense of the word roughly from a wagon) of the planetary system, to which the orbs of the planets are fastened as with a nail—if this, I say, is near the sun, why not in the sun itself? If this axis or point of attachment travels around the earth both close to the sun and in the very same period, why does it describe its own peculiar path? Why does it not hold to the very same path as the sun? I therefore wholeheartedly conclude that if, perchance, Tycho Brahe’s opinion on the world system be universally true, it must be accepted in such form that the center of the planetary system lies upon SG, exactly on the sun’s path, not upon VP; and finally, that it is in the sun itself, and that for liberating the first or eccentric inequality from the second, one should use the planet’s oppositions to the apparent position of the sun, not the mean. Brahe himself in his final days embraced this procedure unreservedly. Let us, then, see what is changed on the eccentric. Once again, as before, when the sun is on the line BC, as at G, and the planet is at F opposite point P, the planet F will be opposite the sun itself, G. Consequently, the sidereal position of the planet will appear to be the same,  along the line GF, whether the continuation of the line be CP or CG, because both have been made into one line. Therefore, according to either procedure, the planet is divested of the second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), an appreciable difference arises. For let the sun have gone from G to S, let the line of the sun’s mean position CV be in Aries, and the planet’s line of vision CO be exactly opposite in Libra, so that VCO is one line. Since CS is beyond CV, the sun\\'s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. But, because of my alteration, the center of the planetary system is not at V but at S when the planet is seen along CO. Therefore, SO being connected, the earth C will lie outside the line SO, and hence, the planet’s apparent position on the line CO still is intermingled with the second inequality. Nor will CO be farther east at a later time, so as to be at opposition to CS. Instead, it will ascend toward CF, because the sun’s motion, and with it the motion of the center of the planetary system and of all its parts (and thus those of the planet O and of the center of the eccentric L), is from the line CO upward towards F, and is much faster than the motion of the eccentric or planet at O about L from the point H towards the bottom. Consequently, O is appreciably drawn back westward by a motion extraneous, not proper, to the eccentric; and indeed, it is well known that the planets are retrograde at opposition to the sun. Therefore, at a time preceding the moment designated by CV (let it be CT), when the sun appears on  line CQ, the planet will be seen at the point opposite its apparent position, at I. And now, since in the present case it is supposed to have shed the second inequality, QCI will be collinear; that is, the point whence the eccentricity arises will be on the line CQ. But CI, the retrograde planet’s line of vision, earlier in time, is beyond the later (and hence more westerly) line of vision CO. Therefore, CQ will also be beyond CV, and Q will be the system’s new center, beyond the old, V. Moreover, the line IQ was made to be more distant from the line ΟV to the east by the angle OCI, while the line of apsides VD or PD (from which the motion begins) remains parallel to itself in the entire circuit. As a result, it appears to be established that the planet goes farther in a shorter period of time around the center Q of the system than it previously did in a greater period of time about the center V of the system. It thereby becomes apparent what is changed in the apparent eccentric motion by this restoration from the sun’s mean position to its apparent position. For when the center of the system is at G and the point opposite, the line of the apparent eccentric position remains unchanged, at Q it is moved forward, and opposite Q it is moved back, for at Q the time is diminished, and opposite Q it is increased. Also, these lines differ greatly from the original ones. Accordingly, when we repeatedly use a new operation, based upon these several apparent positions of the planet (opposite which we are supposing the center of the planetary system to be found; that is, in the sun itself), to investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality, the result of the operation differs greatly from the previous result. For we have just transposed the point of attachment from the circle VP, upon which Brahe had it move around, to the circle GS, that is, to the body of the sun. This new center always stands on a line parallel to CB, at a distance CB from the original Brahean point; for example, above V and P at S and G. Therefore with the point of equality D fixed (so that CV represents the same moment), in order for it to be possible both for the planet to be at O and for the point of attachment to be at S, a new line of apsides needs to be drawn through D and S or G. Consequently, according to the demonstrations of Ch. 5 (which we have brought forward above, in explaining the Copernican form), with DS or DG drawn and divided at M in the ratio in which DP or DV are divided at L, let there be described about center M, with the same radius as before, a new eccentric. This will not only account for the later observations, upon which it was constructed, but, introduced into the prior hypothesis, it will also save the observations previously cited, with a precision of within five minutes. However, computations which are carried out upon the previous eccentric and this new one at positions other than night rising will in some places (particularly near the sun’s perigee) be able to differ by more than one degree, if we use numbers fitting and proper for Mars, which have been furnished by Brahe. There is no need to repeat the demonstration. The drawing is easiest in the Copernican diagram, if from the earth ν you set up a line parallel to βκ, measure off upon it, at an interval βκ above ν, the center of the sun\\'s eccentric, and upon this center set up the Brahean eccentric of the sun through k, and delete the Copernican center of the earth’s eccentric. The differences of the hypotheses, and their equivalence in the first inequalities but discrepancy in the second, have now been expounded. Let us then conclude the first part, which, as I see it, is the most difficult of the entire work, because of the almost inescapable labyrinths of opinion and the perpetual ambiguities of words and extremely tiresome circumlocutions. What necessity it was, however, that forced me to prefix this body of instruction, will now directly appear in Ch. 7. Anyone who is less energetic can defer the whole part until he understands the easier parts. Chapter 7 The circumstances under which I happened upon the theory of Mars. It is true that a divine voice, which enjoins humans to study astronomy, is expressed in the world itself, not in words or syllables, but in things themselves and in the conformity of the human intellect and senses with the sequence of celestial bodies and of their dispositions. Nevertheless, a kind of fate also invisibly drives different individuals to take up different arts, and makes them certain that, just as they are a part of the work of creation, they likewise also partake to some extent in divine providence. When, in my early years, I was able to taste the sweetness of philosophy, I embraced the whole of it with an overwhelming desire, and with practically no special concern about astronomy. I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions. These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go. The first to offer itself was an astronomical position; however, to tell the truth, I was driven forth to take it by the authority of my teachers. I was not frightened by the distance of the place, for (as I have just said) I had condemned this fear in others, but by the low opinion and contempt in which this kind of function is held, and the sparsity of erudition in this part of philosophy. I therefore entered upon this better furnished with wits than with knowledge, protesting loudly that I by no means gave over my right to follow another kind of life which seemed more splendid ^1. What came of those first two years of study may be seen in my Mysterium cosmographicum. The additional goads which my teacher Maestlin gave me towards embracing the rest of astronomy, you will read of in the same book, and in that man’s prefatory letter to Rheticus’s Narratio ^2. I had the very highest opinion of what I discovered there, and all the more so when I saw that Maestlin, too, held it in similar esteem. It was not so much his untimely promise to the readers of what he called my “universal uranic opus” that spurred me on, as it was my own ardor to seek, through a reworking of astronomy, whether my discovery would support observations of complete accuracy. For it had then been demonstrated in that book that the discovery was consistent with the observations within the limits of accuracy of ordinary astronomy. So from that time I began to think seriously of comparing observations. In 1597, I wrote Tycho Brahe asking his opinion of my little book,3 and when he, in reply, mentioned (among other things) his own observations, he ignited in me an overwhelming desire to see them. Moreover, Tycho, who was indeed himself a large part of my destiny, did not cease from then on to invite me to come to him. And since I was frightened off by the distance of the place, I again ascribe it to divine arrangement that he came to Bohemia. I thereupon came to visit him at the beginning of 1600 in hopes of learning the correct eccentricities of the planets. But when I found out during the first week that, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, he made use of the sun’s mean motion, while the apparent motion would be more in accord with my little book (as is clear from the book itself), I begged the master to allow me to make use of the observations in my own manner. At that time, the work which his aide Christian Severinus4 had in hand was the theory of Mars. The occasion had placed this in his hands, in that they were busy with the observation of the acronychal position or opposition of Mars to the sun in 9° Leo. Had Christian been treating a different planet, I would have entered upon it as well. I therefore once again think it to have happened by divine arrangement, that I arrived at the same time in which he was intent upon Mars, from whose motions alone we will have to come to a knowledge of the hidden secrets of astronomy, or remain forever ignorant of them ^5. A table of mean oppositions was worked out, starting with the year 1580. A hypothesis was invented which was proclaimed to represent all these oppositions within a distance of two minutes in longitude. (The numbers I used in Ch. 5 were taken from among these, or differed from them only slightly.) The apogee at the beginning of the year 1585 was placed at 23° 45’ Leo. The maximum eccentricity, made up of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was 20,160, in units of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle was 16,380. Therefore, in the Ptolemaic form of the first inequality, the eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or a little less. From this hypothesis, a table of eccentric equations for individual degrees was constructed, as well as a table of the corrected mean motion, made by adding 1¾’ to the mean motion of the Prutenic Tables ^6. These mean motions, apogees, and likewise the nodes, were extended over a period of forty years, exactly as was done for the solar and lunar motions in Book I of the Progymnasmata. It was only in the latitude at acronychal positions and also the parallax of the annual orb that Christian got stuck. There was, actually, a hypothesis and table for the latitudes, but they failed to elicit the observed latitude. This result was a problem for him, as he was about to brood over the lunar motions. Now since I suspected what proved to be true—that the hypothesis was inadequate—I girded myself for the work following opinions that had been preconceived and had been expressed in my Mysterium cosmographicum. At the beginning there was great controversy between us as to whether it were possible to set up another sort of hypothesis which would express to a hair’s breadth so many positions of the planet, and whether it were possible for the  former hypothesis to be false despite its having accomplished this so far over the entire circuit of the zodiac. I consequently showed, using the arguments presented already in Part I, that an eccentric can be false, yet answer for the appearances within five minutes or better, provided that the equant point be true. As for the parallax of the annual orb, and the latitudes, that prize was still unclaimed, and had not yet been won by the hypothesis of those others. What remains, then, is to find  out whether they, with their computation, might not somewhere differ from the observations by five minutes. I therefore began to investigate the certitude of their operation. What success came of that labor, it would be boring and pointless to recount. I shall describe only so much of that labor of four years as will pertain to our methodical enquiry. Chapter 8 Tycho Brahe’s table of observed and computed observations of Mars’s oppositions to the line of the sun’s mean motion, and an examination thereof. Now the table, mentioned above, was the following: An accurate rendering of the motion of the planet Mars on its eccentric from trustworthy acronychal observations in a variety of positions, carried out sedulously of twenty years (1580 to 1600). 1 The amended mean longitudinal motion of Mars at the beginning of 1585 was found to exceed the numbers provided by the Prutenic calculation2 by at least a minute and a half, or at most 1¾’, which by all indications appears more nearly correct ^3. However, the position of its apogee then fell short of the Prutenic calculation at the same time, by 5° 2’, both being compared with the first star of Aries in the Copernican manner. Hence, owing to our removal of the vernal equinox westward from that star, which was then 28° 2½’,4 it is concluded that Mars’s apogee was at 23° 25’ Leo. For the first date it was set at 23° 20’ Leo, and for the last, at 23° 45’ Leo. Also, the maximum eccentricity, composed of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was found to be 20, 160 parts, of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle, or distance between centers as given by Copernicus, is 16,380. In both of these, however, he differs both from himself and from Ptolemy. Care was taken, where appropriate, concerning refraction, using the solar parallax. THIS, THEN, IS BRAHE’S TABLE We shall begin the examination of the sun’s mean motion with the listed instants of equal time, as many as the table presents. For indeed, it is the sun’s mean position in opposition to which the table says the star Mars was found, referred to the ecliptic. You see here that the sun’s mean position differs from opposition to Mars’s apparent position on the ecliptic by 13½’ in some cases, nearly thrice the error which could arise through a change of hypothesis. Therefore, the exactness of their hypothesis did not prevent my seeking another. But they permitted this discrepancy advisedly. This is clear from the following: since the nodes are about 17° Taurus and Scorpio, and the limits about 17° Leo and Aquarius, as will be said below, the additions and subtractions are made chiefly at 17° Cancer, 25° Virgo, 4° Scorpio, 27° Sagittarius, and 13° Pisces, intermediate points, and none at 21° Leo and 18° Scorpio, the nodes and the limit. They therefore had reason to believe that a planet is not divested of its second inequality unless the sun’s departure from the node is as great as the planet’s on its own orbit. Their intentions, moreover, were not consistent. For, in their way of thinking, the difference ought to be greatest at 3° Cancer, because Cancer is closest to the 45th degree,5 where this difference is generally greatest. But at 17° Cancer they subtracted 5 minutes, while at 3° Cancer, one minute only. Because of this, the following table, comparing the positions (referred to the orbit of Mars) with the mean positions of the sun at these moments, is presented. Clearly, they did not compensate the whole difference in this way. We shall discuss this plan of theirs once more a little later. Now, we shall also examine Mars’s mean motion, for the sake of which, see the following table. 6 7 I am therefore missing something small in the mean longitude. For, that nearly everywhere there is half a minute too much, may be so because of my having computed the mean motions from the most recent table, in which something might possibly have been deliberately altered. There follows a table of Mars’s eccentric positions. All positions are tolerably accurate except 27° Sagittarius. Here, for various reasons, a small but appreciable quantity has been accumulated. First, the sun’s position is 26° 45’ 24” Gemini. Now the computed position on Mars’s orbit is 26° 24’ 43” Sagittarius. In the opinion of the table, 10’ 20” are to be subtracted from the latter to refer it to the ecliptic. Therefore, the computed position on the ecliptic would be 26° 24’ 13” Sagittarius, a difference from opposition to the sun of 21’ 11”. Chapter 9 On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars. But it is now time for us to discuss in detail this adjusting to the ecliptic or to the planet\\'s orbit, which serves as a foundation. First, the table provides us the following information from the observations: the northern latitude takes its rise from 18° Taurus, at which it was five minutes, reaches its observed maximum at 21° Leo, decreased thereafter and became only 1⅔° at 3° Scorpio, but right away at 27° Sagittarius it was south  and a rather large 4°, and still greater at 13° Pisces. From this one concludes roughly that the ascending node is a little before 18° Taurus, and the descending node far beyond 3° Scorpio. The nodes will therefore be around 17° Taurus and 17° Scorpio, and the limits around 17° Leo and Aquarius. Since the plane of Mars’s eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit. I use the term, “observed arcs”, because here one must mentally separate out the planet’s eccentricity, and proceed as though Mars’s path were in the orb of the fixed stars, exactly as is the ecliptic, and as though it really intersected the latter. And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planet’s body intersects the ecliptic. It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosius’s On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planet’s path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect. And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit. Consequently, the arc between the planet’s position on its orbit and the nearest node is always greater than that between its ecliptic position and the same node. Now when we observe the planets, we do not feel convinced that we have  defined their exact positions until we have referred them to the ecliptic. We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found. The ecliptic position is used, therefore, to aid our memory and comprehension. But when, on the other hand, we compute the planet in its own hypothesis,1 we are not concerned with the ecliptic to which it is inclined, but with the exact path of the planet. Therefore, to be able to compare the observed position with the computed position, we must either extend the arc between the ecliptic position and the nearer node, or abridge the arc between the body of the planet and the same node, so that from the former operation the position on the orbit might be given, and from the latter, the ecliptic position. This is actually accomplished by adding or subtracting, according as the node precedes or follows the planet’s position. Such care concerning the planets Ptolemy considered unnecessary. Copernicus did not forego it in treating the moon, and Tycho Brahe diligently embraced it for the sake of precision. To continue: in the referring process which we have been considering, there are two things I would like to know, both of which I can seek using the same procedure  and diagram. Let A be the sidereal position of the node, AB the arc of the ecliptic, and upon it let AC be set equal to AB, and let the planet be observed beneath C. Further, from C let an arc be drawn perpendicular to the ecliptic, and let it be CE. Now in the first place the ancients thought that since E is the position on the ecliptic and C the position of the orbit of the planet I, the planet is at the point opposite the sun when the sun is at E, the planet being observed at C. However, as was said above, those who constructed the tables thought that the planet is not exactly at opposition to the sun unless arc AB, the elongation of the place opposite the sun from the same node, is made equal to AC (the observed distance of the planet from the node). Now the truth of the matter is quite different. The planet is, indeed, seen in opposition to the sun at that time, but it really is not, and the advantage we seek from the planet’s opposition to the sun is more harmed by making AC and AB equal, than they themselves were hoping it would be corrected. For why are the planets observed at opposition to the sun? In order, of course, that they then lack the second inequality of longitude. And when the point opposite the sun is at B and the planet is at C, both being between the nodes and the limits, the planet is more wrapped up in the second inequality of longitude than if the point opposite the sun were at E, the planet remaining at C. For let G be the sun, the center of the planetary system, at which all the orbs intersect the ecliptic, whether in the Copernican or the Brahean form. Let G be joined to A and E, points on the ecliptic, and let the earth be on the line EG, at H. Let HC be joined, and from H let the sun G be observed opposite E, while from the same point H let the planet be seen at C, its sidereal position along the line HC. Therefore, in this sighting, the planet is really on the line HC. It is, however, far below the fixed stars. Let it be at the point I on the line HC, and let a straight line be drawn from G through I, which will intersect the arc CE. For the whole plane CEHG is beneath the arc EC. Let its point of intersection be F, and let a third arc AF be drawn from A through F to BC, cutting BC at D. It is obvious that the plane of the planet’s eccentric viewed from H towards C is set beneath AF, not AC, and that when the point opposite the sun is at E, the planet will really be beneath F, while when the point opposite the sun is located at B the planet is really going to be beneath D, although both do appear beneath C. But AD is shorter than the legs of the isosceles triangle BAC. Therefore, the point B opposite the sun is farther from A than is D, the position beneath which the planet is at the moment they have chosen. Therefore, the sun really stands beyond the point opposite the planet\\'s true position. This is contrary to what they proposed to do. But it is likewise false that if the orbit of the planet were beneath AC, AB should on that account be taken equal to AC. For the orbit’s really being beneath AD is likewise not sufficient reason for taking AD equal to AB. For since the planet is observed at the point opposite the sun in order that it might shed the second inequality of longitude, while the longitude is to be reckoned on the planet’s true orbit, or on AD which stands above it, surely, unless the point opposite the sun falls upon the arc drawn through the planet at right angles to the orbit (that is, unless ADB is a right angle), the point B opposite the sun will not coincide in longitude with D. But if ADB is a right angle, AB is longer than AD. They are therefore not equal. Clearly, therefore, the equality between arcs AC and AB that the table aspires to is undermined. However, for practical purposes, these differences are smaller than can be perceived. I therefore do not hesitate to allow the place opposite the sun to be at E, with AEF right and AFE consequently acute, even though it has just been demonstrated that AFE should be right instead. But it was also necessary to proceed against a new claim of accuracy, by means of accurate arguments. What follows here is the harm arising from this accuracy. In the second place, then, I wish to establish this: that in the table of adjustment they followed a procedure that is unsound. For, given Mars’s ecliptic position E and apparent latitude EC, they computed the length of AC, and stated that the planet on its orbit was then distant from the node by their quantity AC. Now the orbit of the planet (whose first inequality we are investigating) is not beneath AC, but beneath AD, as was just shown. Therefore, the arc AC has nothing to do with the first inequality, but adulterates the planet’s true elongations from A. And furthermore, the apparent latitude is EHC, while the true latitude of the point F, the inclination of the line GF to the ecliptic, is EGF. Thus, although the second inequality of longitude is swallowed up at opposition to the sun, the second inequality of latitude is nonetheless near its maximum there, and its measure is the angle HIG. Therefore, just as the whole latitude EC causes AC to be longer than AE by the arc EB, similarly, the part FC or HIG of this apparent latitude, which is a result of the second inequality, makes AC longer than AF. So it is longer than it should be. And this error cannot be ignored, as it can be as much as 9 minutes. This error could also have been perceived in the inconstancy of the angle BAC, which they attributed to the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars\\'s orbit. This is clear from the result obtained if you suppose the arc AC to be increased by the amount of the addition expressed in the table, and use this and AC to compute the angle EAC. For the angles come out as in the accompanying table,  from which it is clear that in the northern semicircle they suppose an angle of maximum northern latitude of 4° 33’, and in the southern, of 6° 26’ south. According to this, at the subtending line connecting the nodes, which passes through the sun or earth, the plane of the eccentric would somehow be bent, since the upper part is less inclined than the lower. Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planet’s eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle. However, all this is in conflict with the simplicity of the celestial motions, as many examples from experience will attest. Therefore, the true procedure for referring the inclinations to the orbit is this: from the planet’s position E on the ecliptic, known from the observations, to find the angle of inclination EGF for that position, using the method that will follow below. Then, since the angle E is right, from AE and EF (the measure of the angle EGF) AF is found by trigonometry, or instead of EF the constant angle  EAF may be used. And since, from arguments which I shall present below, it is clear that for the star Mars the angle EAF is not greater than about 1° 50’, the adjustment about 45° from the node (where it is maximum) accordingly does not exceed one minute, for which the table nonetheless has one add 8 or 10 minutes in certain places. So for this reason, too, the hypothesis can be in error by as much as 7 and 9 minutes, since the observations upon which it was founded suffered no little loss through this adjustment. I was consequently subject to much less restraint than before in seeking out a new hypothesis. Chapter 10 Consideration of the observations themselves, with which Tycho Brahe hunted for the moments of opposition to the mean sun. In an enquiry of such precision, I could not have foregone a deeper inspection of the foundations themselves. And Brahe had given me the opportunity to make use of his observations. This is what I found. On 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m,1 they set Mars down at 8° 36’ 50” Gemini2 without mentioning the horizontal variations,  by which term I wish the diurnal parallaxes and the refractions to be understood in what follows. Now this observation is distant and isolated. It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3. For in Maestlin,4 on the twelfth at noon, Mars is put at 8° 20’ Gemini, and on the seventeenth, again at noon, it is at 6° 25’ Gemini. Therefore, the motion over five whole days would be 1° 55’. In Stadius,5 it is 1° 52’. Therefore, on the seventeenth at the same hour of 10h 50m, Mars ought to have been seen at either 6° 41’ 50” Gemini, or 6° 44’ 50”. At 9h 40m (which Tycho gives as the moment of opposition), it is 1’ 4” farther forward, at either 6° 42’ 54” or 6° 45’ 54”. They put it at 6° 46’ 10” Gemini. You see that this opposition (as regards exactness) is a little more uncertain because it makes use of a diurnal motion which is not observed but imported from elsewhere, and about which the different authors differ from one another by three minutes over these five days. On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16° 47’ Cancer by observation ^6. The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax. On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21° 18’ 11” Leo ^8. The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24’ 15”. The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward. Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21° 10’ 30” Leo, which is what was accepted. There is no mention of parallax. Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky. I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored. On 1587 March 7 at 19h 10m they deduced the position of Mars from the observations, which was 25° 10’ 20” Virgo. This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. It therefore should have been 25° 8’ 32” Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9. On 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m they established the position of Mars very carefully at 3° 58\\' 21\" Scorpio, and corrected for longitudinal parallax so as to make it 3° 57’ 11” ^10. There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22\\', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. They took the value of 3° 58’ 10”.'"
