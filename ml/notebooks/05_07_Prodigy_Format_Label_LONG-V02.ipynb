      "Summary: On 1590 October 31 at 6¼h in the morning, Mars's eccentric position was 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, while the hypothesis constructed using acronychal observations places it at 8° 19' 29\" Virgo. ['8° 19\\' 20\" Virgo']\n",

      "The equated anomaly of 88° 58’ 7\", to which corresponds a mean anomaly of 91° 1' 53\", ought not to show a value of 99,984, but 100,000, which is the mean between the distances of the figure and of the table. ['88° 58’ 7\"']\n",

      "But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". ['0° 47\\' 30\"']\n",
      "Therefore Mars was 7s 6° 31' 45\" from Cor Leonis. ['6° 31\\' 45\"']\n",
      "Therefore, at noon on 1 January in the first year of Christ, at Hven, it is elongated in its mean motion by 5s 8° 52' 45\" from Cor Leonis ^45. ['8° 52\\' 45\"']\n",
      "But today, in 1599 May 27, it is at 28° 58' 50\" Leo, while Cor Leonis is at 24° 15' 45\" Leo. ['28° 58\\' 50\" Leo']\n",
      "Therefore, the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 1° 47' 0\". ['1° 47\\' 0\"']\n",
      "But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12° 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24° 15’ 30\" Leo. ['12° 47\\' 41\" Pisces']\n",
      "So the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 11° 27' 49\". ['11° 27\\' 49\"']\n",

      "Similarly, the progression of the sun's apogee is found to be 8° 23’, and at the root of the Christian era it was 1s 27° 48’ 0\" before Cor Leonis ^49. ['27° 48’ 0\"']\n",
      "Add the motion of the three days and one hour, near apogee, which is 2° 53' 40\" from modern experience. ['2° 53\\' 40\"']\n",

      "If, however, we use the Ptolemaic eccentricity of the sun, the sun's motion over the three days will be 1' smaller, and the sun will be at 5° 28' 40\" Gemini. ['5° 28\\' 40\" Gemini.']\n",
      "The difference is thus 1° 4' 6\". ['1° 4\\' 6\"']\n",
      "The apparent magnitude of this arc, using the Ptolemaic distance of the sun and earth, 102,100, will be 3° 45' 45\",4 so the planet will fall at 1° 43' Sagittarius. ['3° 45\\' 45\"']\n",
      "From this time interval, by the principles laid down above, the sun's mean motion is found to have gone 5s 25° 32' 50\" beyond Cor Leonis,7 with an anomaly of 234° 54' 34\" . ['25° 32\\' 50\"']\n",
      "The corresponding equation from Ptolemy is 2° 0' 30\", and from Brahe, 1° 42' 54\", additive; and for the former, the sun's distance from the earth is 98,790, and for the latter, 98,976. ['2° 0\\' 30\"']\n",
      "But Mars's mean motion was then 2s 6° 7' 12\" beyond Cor Leonis. ['6° 7\\' 12\"']\n",
      "Also, since the aphelion is 3° 40' 20\" before Cor, Mars's anomaly will be 69° 47' 32\", the equated anomaly 60° 15' 27\", and the distance 158,320. ['3° 40\\' 20\"']\n",
      "Then the sun's elongation from Cor Leonis is 5s 27° 33' 20\",8 differing from Mars's eccentric longitude of 1s 26° 35' 7\" by 4s 0° 58' 13\". ['27° 33\\' 20\"']\n",
      "This arc length, and the distances of the earth and Mars from the sun, show an apparent elongation from the sun of 82° 43' 46\". ['82° 43\\' 46\"']\n",
      "Thus the apparent elongation of Mars from Cor Leonis is 3s 4° 49' 34\" ^9. ['4° 49\\' 34\"']\n",

      "Thus the angle of commutation is 4s 0° 40' 37\". ['0° 40\\' 37\"']\n",
      "Through this, together with our value for the sun's distance from earth, as if it too were the same then, Mars's apparent elongation from Cor Leonis is shown as 3s 4° 51' 28\" ^11. ['4° 51\\' 28\"']\n",
      "For Ptolemy, Cor Leonis is at 2° 30' Leo, and the Northern Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is at 6° 20' Scorpio, at an elongation of 3s 3° 50' 0\". ['3° 50\\' 0\"']\n",
      "The elongation is 3s 3° 20' 0\" ^13. ['3° 20\\' 0\"']\n",

      "Kepler determined the diurnal motions of the Sun and Mars to be 58' 38\" and 22' 36\" respectively, and the sum of the diurnal motions was 1° 21' 14\". ['1° 21\\' 14\"']\n",
      "With the sum of the diurnal motions of Mars and the Sun (1° 21' 14\"), Kepler computed the time it takes for Mars and the Sun to move 58' 38\", that is, about 17 hours 20 minutes. ['1° 21\\' 14\"']\n",
