      "However, when experience seems to teach something different to those who pay careful attention, namely, that the planets deviate from a simple circular path, it gives rise to a powerful sense of wonder, which at length drives people to look into causes. ['rise']\n",
      "Before the distinction between the first motion(1) and the second motions(2) was established, people noted (in contemplating the sun, moon and stars) that their diurnal paths were visually very nearly equivalent to circles. ['diurnal']\n",
      "as here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south. ['north']\n",
      "They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion. ['diurnal']\n",
      "The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I). ['conjunction']\n",
      "Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG). ['interval']\n",
      "The former of these terms originally corresponded to a star which, on the next day, comes to its setting earlier (the sun E is said to be προηγούμενος with respect to the moon G). ['star']\n",
      "The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I). ['star']\n",
      "And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile. ['diurnal']\n",
      "It, however, it appears to be 'leading' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion. ['retrograde']\n",
      "For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at P while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP. ['fixed star']\n",
      "Instead of unending spirals, a new one always being added to the end of the earlier one at E or G, there remained little but the solitary circles FG and AE, and a single common motion, either of all the planets and the whole world as well in a direction opposite to the proper motions, or (with the world standing still, according to Aristarchus) of the earth's globe T around the axis QR in the same direction as the proper motions. ['axis']\n",
      "Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them. ['diurnal']\n",
      "For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observed—less striking to the eyes—because the diurnal motion was very swift. ['observed']\n",
      "And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals. ['diurnal']\n",
      "But now, that minute division and distribution of the star's proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously.

      "At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion. ['retrograde']\n",
      "And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence. ['observed']\n",
      "If one were to bundle all this together, and were at the same time to believe that the sun really moves through the zodiac in the space of a year, as Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe believed, he would then have to grant that the circuits of the three superior planets through the aethereal space, composed as they are of several motions, are real spirals, not (as before) in the manner of balled up yarn, with spirals set side by side, but more like the shape of a pretzel,6 as in the following diagram. ['diagram']\n",
      "This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the year 1580 until the year 1596, on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it. ['star']\n",
      "Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram. ['orb']\n",
      "Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun's motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun. ['orb']\n",
      "In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times. ['diagram']\n",

      "For since the presence and conjunction of the sun makes them go faster than usual, and the opposition of the sun has the opposite effect, before and after these points they are surely much removed from the positions they were going to occupy through the action of the first inequality.

      "Similarly, if we should propose these Aristotelian orbs as objects of contemplation, two things will present themselves to us: 1) the motive force, sufficient for the round orb, from whose activity and constant strength the time of revolution arises; 2) the direction in which it acts.

      "So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet. ['orb']\n",

      "Physically speaking, it is not so much the observer which is to be placed at α as the power which renders the planetary circuit around itself slow or swift according to the ratios of its proximity to α, as was said above. ['circuit']\n",
      "Let some point on the circumference not on the line of apsides (say, η) be connected with γ, β, and α. Let it be that about as many angles ιαη may be computed by this hypothesis throughout the entire circuit as are observed from α, and after certain periods of time, which the angle ηγι measures uniformly. ['apsides']\n",
      "Again, let the observer or moving power be at some point not on the line ια, and let this be δ. Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about δ be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from δ. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at δ square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered. ['sidereal']\n",
      "Therefore, during the same twenty days the planet will appear to make greater progress to one who is at α than to one who is at δ. And since any planet maintains a fixed and constant number of days in which it is returned to the same sidereal position, the slowness has to be compensated by a contrary speed. ['sidereal']\n",
      "Nevertheless,  the planet itself can be truly slowest in but one place on its orbit. ['orbit']\n",
      "If the planet were of equal speed at all parts of its orbit, the answer, according to what was said in Ch. ['orbit']\n",
      "But since in terms of real and true increment of time2 the planet is slowest at one point on the eccentric and fastest at the opposite point, the answer must therefore be, clearly not. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The reason for this is that the two slowings are intermingled, one real and physical, occurring at one place on the eccentric, and the other optical and apparent and not occurring at a single place, but in the place most distant from whatever position is chosen for the observer. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now, when the observer α lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric β and the center of the equant γ on the side of β opposite the center of the equant γ, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position ι. But when the observer departs from this line, as at δ, then a straight line drawn from δ through the center of the circle β marks the place of the optical slowing, η, while the true and physical slowing is at ι. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between ι and η, as would be if a line were to be drawn from δ through γ to the point ζ. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which δβ were the line of apsides of the eccentric and βγ the line of the equant’s eccentricity, then even though the planet’s true path ιη remained the same, it would be represented differently at δ than at α. For to the observer at δ the planet would be slowest at ζ, and to the one at α it would be slowest at ι. But no such thing would be represented at δ that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For the forms of the hypotheses differ in that in the former, β is the midpoint between α and γ (as physical considerations require, if the moving power is in α), while in the latter the center of the eccentric β would not be the midpoint between δ and γ, nor would the line of the equant’s eccentricity pass through the observer δ, as before. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Even if it did pass through δ, as δγ, it would not cut the eccentric into two equal parts, because it would not cut it at the center β, and it would not allow the planet to appear on one side fastest and on the other slowest, at opposite places. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about δ, and how much this newly established hypothesis at δ will be at variance with the appearances as seen at α. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from γ to the line δβ, and βμ be made equal to βγ, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at η rather than ι. This  changes what cannot be changed in the planet’s path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observer’s viewpoint. ['equant']\n",
      "Even though the planet would traverse the same path ιη in twenty days (which path appears greater at α and smaller at δ), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between ι and η. In particular, for the observer at α the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at δ, you will prevent the planet’s being slowest at ι; that is, if you transfer the equant from γ to μ. For if you draw a straight line through γμ to the point ν on the circumference and connect αν, this equation ανμ alone will be equal to the prior, ανγ. ['equant']\n",
      "Whence it follows that for the observer at α, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from δ through the center of the eccentric β. And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point γ, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere. ['apsides']\n",
      "But what will happen if a new line of apsides be drawn from δ through the old equant point γ, and a new hypothesis of the same form as the old be set up? ['apsides']\n",
      "That is, if the center of the eccentric be transferred from β to the line δγ, and δθ be made to θγ as αβ is to βγ, θ thus being the center of the eccentric? ['eccentric']\n",
      "About θ let the eccentric εκλ be described, equal to the previous one, and through θβ let a straight line be extended to the circumference, on one side to ξο and on the other to ρπ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, ξο and ρπ are both of the same magnitude as θβ, and the planet is this much closer to β at ο, and more remote at ρ, than it would have been had it traversed the previous eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "However, the planet is slowest in a different region, for previously the apsis was at ι, and now it is at k. Through this mutual tempering it is brought about that the observer previously stationed at α has his observations pretty much unchanged, which is the only thing sought for here. ['apsis']\n",
      "Let the magnitudes on the line δγα be taken as follows: let δα be the quantity of the sun’s eccentricity, 3584; δγ the eccentricity of Mars, 30,138 of the same parts, and the angle αδγ 47° 59¼’, which is the angular difference between the sun’s and Mars’s apogees. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Now, from these three given quantities, γα, Mars’s new eccentricity, will also be given, and will be 27,971, while the angle δγα is 5° 27’ 47”. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "On the supposition that the old apogee of Mars δγ is positioned at 23° 32' 16\" Leo, Mars’s new apogee αγ will fall at 29° 0’ 16” Leo. ['apogee']\n",
      "To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at δ, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from ρθο to πβξ, we must proceed as follows. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric εο, it will at that moment be at ε with equation δεγ, but if it is traversing ιξ, it will be at ι with no equation, since the line of apparent motion αι coincides with the line of mean motion γι. ['eccentric']\n",
      "At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric εo will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing ιξ will be at ζ with equation γζα. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from γ, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below ξ and above ρ. Third, it must be close to δ (just as it is closer above ρ than below ξ, because the center of the other eccentric β lies off to the right of δ). ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let σφ be drawn through γ perpendicular to δγ, intersecting the eccentric about θ at σ and υ, and the other at τ and φ, and to this let the perpendicular βχ be dropped. ['eccentric']\n",

      "Moreover, it is still within the practitioner's power to vary somewhat the mean motion and the ratio of the eccentricities both among themselves and in relation to the radius of the orb, should this become useful, for the purpose of obliterating this discrepancy of some five minutes. ['orb']\n",
      "This equivalence pertains chiefly to the first inequality—that is, to the appearances at δ, close to the center of the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "However, in the second inequality (the equation for the annual orb), it makes a big difference whether the planet goes around on ξπ or oρ, as was also noted above in the other equivalence. ['orb']\n",
      "Hitherto, we have transposed the observer from δ to α. Let it now be demonstrated that very nearly the same things happen if the observer remains fixed while the point of the equant is transposed. ['equant']\n",
      "This we do to make it clear that the same thing can be done in this chapter with an eccentric that has an equant as could be done on a simple eccentric (at the end of Chapter 3 above). ['eccentric']\n",
      "In the earlier case, the result was the same whether the observer or the center of the eccentric were transposed, while here, likewise, the result is almost the same whether the observer or the center of the equant be transposed. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let δ, θ, and γ remain the same, but let the line γβα of the previous diagram be deleted, and replaced by ΑΒΓ parallel to it and passing through the point δ or Α. Let the segments ΑΒ, ΑΓ be equal to the previous segments αβ, αγ. ['diagram']\n",
      "The only difference is that the two points on the two eccentrics at which the planet is to be placed at a given moment are no longer determined by a single line, but by parallel lines drawn from the two equant points Γ, γ, each extended to its own eccentric. ['equant']\n",
      "For example, when the eccentric θκ has its planet at κ, the eccentric ΒΙ will have it at Ζ, where γκ and ΓΖ are parallel. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The rest is clear from the diagram without demonstration. ['diagram']\n",
      "Now, suppose it is not permissible to shift the observer (and it is not permitted by those who make the earth the center of the world, as will be remarked in the next chapter), and that the planet has been observed in several positions on the zodiac, always at opposition to the sun's mean position, and that the practitioner will use the positions and the intervals of time between them to construct this sort of hypothesis, with the observer at δ, δθ the eccentricity of the eccentric θκ, θγ the eccentricity of the equant, and κ the apogee. ['observed']\n",
      "Comes now Kepler, who would change the observed positions and times; that is, he would observe the moments and points at which the planet is at opposition to the apparent position of the sun rather  than its mean position. ['observed']\n",
      "From these positions and times he will have come up with another hypothesis, in which the observer would be left unmoved at δ or Α, but where the eccentricity would come out to be ΑΒ in a new eccentric ΒΙ, and the eccentricity ΑΓ of a new equant Γ, and there would be a new apogee Ι. The question now is whether, if the prior practitioner combines the new eccentric ΒΙ with his original equalizing point γ, the computed equation and sidereal position of the planet will turn out much different from what he had formerly found using his eccentric γκ. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "It has thus been demonstrated in a Ptolemaic eccentric what sort of disturbances would arise if one should transpose either the observer or the orb and construct a new eccentric, making use of the planet’s oppositions to the sun’s apparent position. ['eccentric']\n",

      "But around the middle intervals these points will be separated from each other only by the amount that separated υ and Φ in the previous diagram. ['diagram']\n",
      "I now immediately state it as a postulate that whatever we shall demonstrate using the Ptolemaic equant-cum-eccentric also be taken as demonstrated in the Copernican or Brahean concentric-cum-double-epicycle, or eccentrepicycle. ['equant']\n",
      "Now we pass on to the other inequality, which completes its cycle not at a single constant sign of the zodiac but with the sun’s opposition to, or conjunction with, the planet. ['opposition']\n",
      "People have wondered exceedingly at this, different ones proposing different reasons why a planet in conjunction with the sun is made swift, direct, high, and small; and opposite the sun, retrograde, low, and large; while in between it becomes stationary and of a medium size. ['conjunction']\n",
      "The Latin authors considered that in the sun’s aspects and rays there is a force by which the other planets are in fact attracted. ['rays']\n",
      "Ptolemy said that at a determined point on the planetary circle that serves for the first inequality, there is fixed, not the planet itself, but the center of an epicycle bearing the planet fixed upon its circumference, which is in turn borne by the planet’s chief circle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "The motion has the following form: if the center of the epicycle be in conjunction with the sun, the planet is also at the highest point of the epicycle and is moved along with the sun in the same direction, [and] when the sun, which is faster, departs from the center of this epicycle, the planet simultaneously descends on the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But since the epicycle’s motion about its center is faster than the motion of its center about the earth, it hence happens that when the planet traverses the lower parts of the epicycle while the epicycle’s center is at opposition to the sun, the compounding of motions makes it actually retrograde. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For we still seek the cause that connects all the epicycles of the planets to the sun, so that they always complete their periods when their centers are in conjunction with the sun. ['conjunction']\n",
      "1 the diurnal motion was separated from the motion proper to the planets, the second inequality of the planets is likewise now separated from the first by Copernicus, and in quite the same way. ['diurnal']\n",
      "For while the earth rotates upon its axis from west to east, it appears to our eyes that the rest of the world rotates from east to west. ['axis']\n",
      "It is, I claim, in just the same way that Copernicus asserts that the planets do not really become stationary and retrograde, but  only appear so. ['retrograde']\n",
      "In astronomical terms, Ptolemy put epicycles on eccentrics, while Brahe put eccentrics on a single epicycle, which is the sun’s orb itself. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For the present we must carry out what we set out for ourselves and what is to be demonstrated, namely, that there is a very great error indeed in the second inequality if the apparent position of the sun is replaced by its mean position, to which the planet is at opposition at the beginning of this second inequality. ['opposition']\n",
      "About center β let the earth’s eccentric γυ be described, such as Copernicus, putting his trust in Ptolemy, imagined. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let γβ be its line of apsides, κ the position of the motionless sun, and β the point about which the earth’s motion is uniform. ['apsides']\n",
      "In effect, by adopting this procedure, Copernicus established a fictitious  observer at the point β. For provided that the planet is on the line βυ, it makes no difference for the purpose of designating its sidereal position whether it be viewed from σ or from β. The same may be truly said of the lines βγ, βσ, and all the other infinite lines intersecting at β. Therefore, β is the point of intersection of all the lines of vision, and is thus the fictitious common point for all observers. ['sidereal']\n",
      "So Copernicus believed the planet was freed from the second inequality whenever the planet and the earth were found on any one line passing through β. Consequently, he endeavored to find the apparent sidereal position of a planet at those moments of opposition to the mean position of the sun through mathematical instruments. ['sidereal']\n",
      "For if the planet’s position was found on one of the nights near the planet’s opposition to the sun, and if at that time the mean position of the sun was found by calculation to be at the point precisely opposite, then that was the moment of time desired. ['opposition']\n",
      "However, if there was still a little distance between them on that night, then he tracked down this moment of time, and the point or position held by the planet at this moment, by a comparison of two or more nights and of the diurnal motions of Mars and the earth over the interval. ['diurnal']\n",
      "When he had done this as many times and in as many places  on the zodiac as he thought necessary (suppose, for example, βγ, βυ, βσ), the practitioner now began to use these known sidereal or zodiacal positions of the planet, βγ, βυ, βσ, to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality. ['sidereal']\n",
      "This involved finding the magnitude of the planetary circle's eccentricity from the selected point β, and the parts of the zodiac into which the apogee points, by comparing the angles which the observed positions set up about the point of observation β, with the time intervals between them. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Suppose these things already done, giving a line of apsides βδ, eccentricity of the equant point βδ, and the center of the eccentric on this line at the point λ, and let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the moment of opposition to the sun’s mean position. ['apsides']\n",
      "But it is this that I have been wanting: Let βδ be extended so as to intersect the eccentric at χ and ξ, and near χ let some point τ on the eccentric be chosen, and lines be drawn from τ to δ and λ. Now χτ is the measure of the angle χλτ, while the angle χδτ is greater than the angle χλτ by the amount δτλ, and δ is the point of temporal uniformity ^4. ['eccentric']\n",
      "minds would bypass the point κ (which has a geometrical affinity for motion, being invested with a body of no small magnitude) and pay attention to the point β, only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities)5 of the solar body distant from the sun, empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone? ['solar']\n",
      "16, that the sun is really fixed at κ, wherefore the eccentricity δκ is constant, while he holds that the point β, which he takes as the center of the annual orb, is displaced over the ages, thus making βδ shorter. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Led by these probable arguments, I concluded that the line of apsides taken in order to produce the planet’s first inequality, ought to go right through κ itself rather than β. But we shall obtain this result when we make use of the sidereal positions which the planet has at the moment when the sun’s apparent position and its own are opposite. ['apsides']\n",
      "And when the points κ and β are collinear with the earth γ, and when the planet itself falls on the same line at the same time, as at τ, it is at the same moment at opposition to both the sun’s mean position and its apparent position. ['opposition']\n",
      "But when the earth comes to the side of its eccentric, or rather the middle intervals,6 a fairly large difference arises between them. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For let the earth have traveled from γ to υ (that is, let the sun, directly opposite, have moved from perigee in Capricorn to Aries), and let the line of the sun’s mean position υβ be found in Aries, while the line upon which the planet is observed in Libra be exactly opposite, namely, υω. ['perigee']\n",
      "Now since υκ is farther eastward beyond υβ, the sun’s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. ['eastward']\n",
      "Therefore the apparent opposition precedes the mean. ['opposition']\n",
      "So, at a time preceding the moment designated by βυ (call it βθ), the planet will fall upon a line drawn from κ through θ, that is, at ζ. And then the planet’s line of vision θζ (as the less experienced should diligently note) lies farther eastward beneath the fixed stars than the line υω of the later time. ['eastward']\n",
      "This is because, although θζ precedes the line υω in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if θ, υ, and absolutely all points on the earth’s circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars. ['west']\n",
      "Therefore, it is not the distance of the endpoints θ and υ but the inclination of the lines θζ and υω that causes the lines to strike upon different zodiacal positions, since they would be perceived as coinciding if they were parallel. ['inclination']\n",
      "But it can be shown even more easily that at an earlier time the planet is farther east, since at opposition it is retrograde, as is clear to everyone. ['east']\n",
      "For, at τ and the point opposite, the original positions remain; αt ζ οr ω an addition is made to the observed position, since θζ (as was said) is farther eastward than υω. ['observed']\n",
      "That is, since we have transferred the fictitious point of observation to the sun κ (by virtue of our having viewed the planet when it was at τ and ζ and the earth was on the lines κτ and κζ, namely, at the points γ and θ), the eccentricity will now originate at the point κ. But in Ch. ['observation']\n",
      "5 above, it was shown that when the observer is shifted from β to κ and a line is drawn from κ through the original point of uniformity δ, although this new hypothesis does result in a new eccentric, it is one that, for the observer at β, leaves nearly all his appearances undisturbed. ['eccentric']\n",
      "So, by joining δκ, dividing it at μ so that δλ is to δμ as δβ is to δκ, tracing out a new eccentric ηε about μ equal to the previous one ξχ, and drawing a new line of apsides through κδ, a new hypothesis will be formed, whose apsis is at η. Previously, however, we had improperly called χ the apogee, because the Copernican center β on the line χβ was the successor to the Ptolemaic position of the earth. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now, following my own notions, we shall call η the aphelion (since we are in the Copernican hypothesis), and the  point opposite it perihelion, because the sun’s distance from η is a maximum ^7. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Third, it has been driven home that in astronomical terms those opinions8 do not differ in any important way at the moments of conjunction and opposition9. ['conjunction']\n",
      "If a line be drawn through the centers of the eccentrics λ, μ, parallel to βκ, and extended to intersect each eccentric in two points, above and below, there will be set up, below, the maximum space ερ between the two, equal to λμ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "It is required to find the point on the earth’s orb from which the lines of vision passing through ε and through ρ are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at ρ when it should have been placed at ε. ['orb']\n",
      "First, the angle will be greater down at ε than up near τ because the earth’s orbit, described about β, moves the observer nearer to ερ than to τ. Next, since δρ is beyond τβ, ερ is seen more obliquely from the left side than from the right. ['orbit']\n",
      "Therefore (assuming these numbers), when the sun is passing through 16° Cancer while the planet is at 8½° Capricorn in its mean and uniform motion, and in the neighborhood of 27° Scorpio in its apparent motion, ερ appears maximum. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "So, at last, you see how much my transposition of the hypothesis from the mean to the apparent position of the sun creates a disturbance in the annual parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "Therefore, by the observations as well, a door has opened for us to determine what I had deduced a priori by consideration of moving causes: that the planet’s line of apsides, which is the only line bisecting the planet’s path into two semicircles equal both in size and in vigor—this line, I say, does not (as the practitioners have it) pass through some point other than the sun, but right through the center of the solar body. ['apsides']\n",
      "About center Ψ let the eccentric of the sun Γ be described, upon which let ΨΓ be the line of apsides, with the motionless earth at point Κ of the line ΨΓ on the side nearest Γ, and Ψ be the point about which the sun’s motion is reckoned as being uniform. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let ΚΣ be the line of the sun’s apparent motion, and ΚΥ the line of the sun’s uniform  motion. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "For whenever the planet fell upon these lines ΚΥ on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy’s opinion) because of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Then the planet’s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. ['sidereal']\n",
      "From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about Κ, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be ΚΛΔΧ, with Δ the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point Λ, and the eccentric ΧΖ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet’s opposition to the sun’s mean position. ['observed']\n",
      "For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth Κ, performed on the circle ΧΖ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth Κ (just as there was before in Copernicus’s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle’s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet’s body. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? ['eccentric']\n",
      "Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. ['opposition']\n",
      "For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point Υ (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked Σ, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? ['epicycle']\n",
      "Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines ΚΣ of the sun’s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle? ['epicycle']\n",
      "Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun’s apparent position. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Again (as before) when the sun Γ, the center of the sun’s eccentric Ψ, and the earth Κ are on the same line, so that the line of the sun’s apparent position ΨΓ and the line of its mean position ΚΓ coincide, then for the center of the epicycle Τ this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by ΚΤ or by ΨΤ, and the planet is really on the line ΚΤ or ΨΤ and at the lowest point on its epicycle Φ, since here it is nearest to both Ψ and Κ. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet Ω on this line of vision ΚΩ is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle Ζ on the line ΚΩ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But since ΚΣ has gone beyond ΚΥ, the sun’s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. ['opposition']\n",
      "And in the last part of the time, ΚΩ is not descending, so as to be opposite ΚΣ, but ascends towards ΚΦ, because the lowest parts of the epicycle Ω are retrograde and swifter than the center Ζ, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one. ['opposition']\n",
      "Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line ΞΚ, say at Ο. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time ΚΘ prior to ΚΥ the planet is on the line ΚΙ later than at ΚΩ. ['opposition']\n",
      "Therefore, ΚΟ too is more to the east than ΚΖ. ['east']\n",
      "Thus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle’s center by this restoration from the sun’s mean position to its apparent position. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For at Τ and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle’s center remain unchanged. ['epicycle']\n",
      "At Ζ this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. ['epicycle']\n",
      "At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. ['observed']\n",
      "That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. ['apogee']\n",
      "And since in the greater quadrant ΒΖ of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. ['apogee']\n",
      "Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from Χ towards Ζ.\n",
      "The quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. ['perigee']\n",
      "It is presupposed that the planet Ω falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle Ζ through the earth Κ, only when ΚΖ is collinear with ΚΣ, the sun’s apparent position. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun’s mean position was ΚΥ, drawn through Ω, the planet was observed on the line ΚΩ, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle Ζ is on ΚΩ at the same time. ['observed']\n",
      "We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line ΩΟ, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as Ω (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from Κ on the line ΚΖ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at Ζ by Ptolemy and at Ο by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line ΚΥ in the theory of the sun. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy's account) is at the other end of the line of the sun’s mean position in the neighborhood of ΚΥ (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove). ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line ΔΔ drawn from Δ to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to ΖΟ or ΨΚ, equal to ΖΟ, and very nearly equal to ΨΚ, and the new Δ will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis. ['epicycle']\n",
      "5 above, it was shown that if through Δ a line ΔΔ be drawn parallel to ΚΨ, ΚΨ being equal to ΔΔ, and if the new Δ be joined to Κ, and the new line ΚΔ be cut at Μ in the same ratio in which the previous ΚΔ was cut at Δ, then by this new hypothesis a new eccentric is constructed, that is, one having a different position from the former, which even if applied in the prior hypothesis would still leave all the appearances to an observer at Κ very nearly undisturbed. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let such a new eccentric be described about Μ, equal to the former, and let ΚΜ be extended in both directions. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The new apogee will be Η, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points Β, Ο, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at Α and farther at Ι than before. ['apogee']\n",
      "However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis. ['eccentric']\n",
      "(This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sun’s eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicus’s and Tycho’s discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.) ['epicycle']\n",
      "The reason is not that the point of equality Δ does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sun’s apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval ΛΜ. ['apsides']\n",
      "Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sun’s middle distances. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from ΔΔ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "It is therefore greatest near the sun’s apsides, and greater near perigee on ΜΛ extended so as to intersect the eccentrics at Ρ and Ε. For ΡΕ is of the same magnitude as ΜΛ. ['apsides']\n",
      "The question now is, where would this discrepancy appear greatest, in terms of the circumference of the epicycle? ['epicycle']\n",
      "It is certain that this does not occur at the parts of the epicycle nearest Κ, the earth, because these parts would be in the same direction as Κ, nor at the highest parts of the epicycle, because they would be too far away. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, this will occur at the parts of the epicycle near perigee, therefore when the sun, and the planet with it, are not exactly at perigee but nearby: namely (to put it briefly) at the points Ν and Π corresponding to the same moment of time, such that the small circle through them and Κ is a minimum. ['epicycle']\n",
      "About center B let the solar eccentric GS be described, with line of apsides BG, C the position of the immobile earth, and B the point of equality, following the opinion of the authorities. ['solar']\n",
      "For it will be shown in due course that the point of equality and the center of the eccentric are not the same in the theory of the sun. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Of this path trodden by Tycho (if we proceed on it with Ptolemy’s views), it should be said that whenever a planet is on one of the lines of the sun’s mean position CV, on the side opposite the sun, the planet is divested of its second inequality, which, in Brahe’s opinion, is applied to it on account of the motion of the center of the eccentric around the earth in the same time as the sun does so. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This common point, with respect to which all the planets are said to perform their eccentric motion, and at which the whole planetary system is  conceived as being attached to the sun’s orbit—this point, I say, is always on the line of the sun’s mean position, distant from the earth C by a constant distance BS, and describing a concentric V equal to the eccentric GS.

      "So what we said about the attachment of the whole system to the sun’s orbit, we said to win over those who believe in solid orbs. ['orbit']\n",
      "Let VC be extended, and let the planet be on that line beyond C. In this configuration, Brahe will place the point at which the planetary system is attached at V. The planet will be observed on the line VC. ['observed']\n",
      "Next, let the planet’s sidereal position be taken with instruments whenever it shall be seen at some point on the line CV opposite V beyond C (let this be on the lines CV, CG, and points opposite). ['sidereal']\n",
      "(Nevertheless, in the theory of Mars, the planet’s eccentric is so small in proportion to the sun’s eccentric that Mars’s eccentric and the points O and F are nearer to the earth C than is the sun S, which was one of the reasons why Brahe denied the solidity of the orbs.) ['eccentric']\n",
      "From many positions of this sort, as many, in fact, as he could obtain, Tycho Brahe used to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality, by removing the magnitude of the orb VP and treating it as a single point, as though in the meanwhile the center VP of the planetary  system, the point at which the system is attached, had remained at rest.

      "For the present, I am postponing a more careful examination of whether this sort of hypothesis is in accord with physical principles—a hypothesis, that is, in which the sun, through its motive mind paying attention to the earth, moves around the earth, and of itself (since it lacks an orb) drives itself forward nonuniformly according to its approach to or recession from the earth (unless you would make the earth more important than the sun and ascribe to the earth the sun's motive force); while this same sun (as in Copernicus) sends out a motive force to all the planets, sweeping them around itself with a degree of speed corresponding to their degree of nearness to the sun; the planets meanwhile striving to accomplish their approach to and recession from the sun on a small epicycle, and at the same time to follow the sun, wherever it is supposed to be, in those same tracks not proper to them; and thus any planet, and most of all the sun, attends to many things at once, and the actual trajectories of the planets through the aethereal air (as with Ptolemy) make spirals, such as were depicted in Ch. ['orb']\n",
      "The question is, whether it is also fitting, in particular, that the planets follow the sun’s body S, G, or whether they instead follow the point V, P, void of any body, four solar semidiameters (no more) from the center of the sun, which is now above the sun and now below, now before and now behind. ['solar']\n",
      "And further, whether it is more fitting that the force that drives the planets in an orb around the sun make its nest in the body of the sun S, G, or in some other point such as VP void of body. ['orb']\n",
      "In brief:  if the axle [axis] (to derive the sense of the word roughly from a wagon) of the planetary system, to which the orbs of the planets are fastened as with a nail—if this, I say, is near the sun, why not in the sun itself? ['axis']\n",
      "If this axis or point of attachment travels around the earth both close to the sun and in the very same period, why does it describe its own peculiar path? ['axis']\n",
      "I therefore wholeheartedly conclude that if, perchance, Tycho Brahe’s opinion on the world system be universally true, it must be accepted in such form that the center of the planetary system lies upon SG, exactly on the sun’s path, not upon VP; and finally, that it is in the sun itself, and that for liberating the first or eccentric inequality from the second, one should use the planet’s oppositions to the apparent position of the sun, not the mean. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let us, then, see what is changed on the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Once again, as before, when the sun is on the line BC, as at G, and the planet is at F opposite point P, the planet F will be opposite the sun itself, G. Consequently, the sidereal position of the planet will appear to be the same,  along the line GF, whether the continuation of the line be CP or CG, because both have been made into one line. ['sidereal']\n",
      "But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), an appreciable difference arises. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Since CS is beyond CV, the sun's apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. ['opposition']\n",
      "Nor will CO be farther east at a later time, so as to be at opposition to CS. ['east']\n",
      "Instead, it will ascend toward CF, because the sun’s motion, and with it the motion of the center of the planetary system and of all its parts (and thus those of the planet O and of the center of the eccentric L), is from the line CO upward towards F, and is much faster than the motion of the eccentric or planet at O about L from the point H towards the bottom. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Consequently, O is appreciably drawn back westward by a motion extraneous, not proper, to the eccentric; and indeed, it is well known that the planets are retrograde at opposition to the sun. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, at a time preceding the moment designated by CV (let it be CT), when the sun appears on  line CQ, the planet will be seen at the point opposite its apparent position, at I. And now, since in the present case it is supposed to have shed the second inequality, QCI will be collinear; that is, the point whence the eccentricity arises will be on the line CQ. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But CI, the retrograde planet’s line of vision, earlier in time, is beyond the later (and hence more westerly) line of vision CO. ['retrograde']\n",
      "Therefore, CQ will also be beyond CV, and Q will be the system’s new center, beyond the old, V. Moreover, the line IQ was made to be more distant from the line ΟV to the east by the angle OCI, while the line of apsides VD or PD (from which the motion begins) remains parallel to itself in the entire circuit. ['east']\n",
      "It thereby becomes apparent what is changed in the apparent eccentric motion by this restoration from the sun’s mean position to its apparent position. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For when the center of the system is at G and the point opposite, the line of the apparent eccentric position remains unchanged, at Q it is moved forward, and opposite Q it is moved back, for at Q the time is diminished, and opposite Q it is increased. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This new center always stands on a line parallel to CB, at a distance CB from the original Brahean point; for example, above V and P at S and G. Therefore with the point of equality D fixed (so that CV represents the same moment), in order for it to be possible both for the planet to be at O and for the point of attachment to be at S, a new line of apsides needs to be drawn through D and S or G. Consequently, according to the demonstrations of Ch. ['apsides']\n",
      "5 (which we have brought forward above, in explaining the Copernican form), with DS or DG drawn and divided at M in the ratio in which DP or DV are divided at L, let there be described about center M, with the same radius as before, a new eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "However, computations which are carried out upon the previous eccentric and this new one at positions other than night rising will in some places (particularly near the sun’s perigee) be able to differ by more than one degree, if we use numbers fitting and proper for Mars, which have been furnished by Brahe. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The drawing is easiest in the Copernican diagram, if from the earth ν you set up a line parallel to βκ, measure off upon it, at an interval βκ above ν, the center of the sun's eccentric, and upon this center set up the Brahean eccentric of the sun through k, and delete the Copernican center of the earth’s eccentric. ['diagram']\n",
      "These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. ['inclination']\n",
      "But when I found out during the first week that, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, he made use of the sun’s mean motion, while the apparent motion would be more in accord with my little book (as is clear from the book itself), I begged the master to allow me to make use of the observations in my own manner. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "The occasion had placed this in his hands, in that they were busy with the observation of the acronychal position or opposition of Mars to the sun in 9° Leo. ['observation']\n",
      "A hypothesis was invented which was proclaimed to represent all these oppositions within a distance of two minutes in longitude. ['longitude']\n",
      "The apogee at the beginning of the year 1585 was placed at 23° 45’ Leo. ['apogee']\n",
      "The maximum eccentricity, made up of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was 20,160, in units of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle was 16,380. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Therefore, in the Ptolemaic form of the first inequality, the eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or a little less. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "From this hypothesis, a table of eccentric equations for individual degrees was constructed, as well as a table of the corrected mean motion, made by adding 1¾’ to the mean motion of the Prutenic Tables ^6. ['eccentric']\n",
      "These mean motions, apogees, and likewise the nodes, were extended over a period of forty years, exactly as was done for the solar and lunar motions in Book I of the Progymnasmata. ['nodes']\n",
      "It was only in the latitude at acronychal positions and also the parallax ['latitude']\n",
      "of the annual orb that Christian got stuck. ['orb']\n",
      "There was, actually, a hypothesis and table for the latitudes, but they failed to elicit the observed latitude. ['observed']\n",
      "At the beginning there was great controversy between us as to whether it were possible to set up another sort of hypothesis which would express to a hair’s breadth so many positions of the planet, and whether it were possible for the  former hypothesis to be false despite its having accomplished this so far over the entire circuit of the zodiac. ['circuit']\n",
      "I consequently showed, using the arguments presented already in Part I, that an eccentric can be false, yet answer for the appearances within five minutes or better, provided that the equant point be true. ['eccentric']\n",

      "An accurate rendering of the motion of the planet Mars on its eccentric from trustworthy acronychal observations in a variety of positions, carried out sedulously of twenty years (1580 to 1600). ['eccentric']\n",
      "The amended mean longitudinal motion of Mars at the beginning of 1585 was found to exceed the numbers provided by the Prutenic calculation2 by at least a minute and a half, or at most 1¾’, which by all indications appears more nearly correct ^3. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "However, the position of its apogee then fell short of the Prutenic calculation at the same time, by 5° 2’, both being compared with the first star of Aries in the Copernican manner. ['apogee']\n",
      "Hence, owing to our removal of the vernal equinox westward from that star, which was then 28° 2½’,4 it is concluded that Mars’s apogee was at 23° 25’ Leo. ['vernal equinox']\n",
      "Also, the maximum eccentricity, composed of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was found to be 20, 160 parts, of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle, or distance between centers as given by Copernicus, is 16,380. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Care was taken, where appropriate, concerning refraction, using the solar parallax. ['refraction']\n",
      "For indeed, it is the sun’s mean position in opposition to which the table says the star Mars was found, referred to the ecliptic. ['opposition']\n",
      "You see here that the sun’s mean position differs from opposition to Mars’s apparent position on the ecliptic by 13½’ in some cases, nearly thrice the error which could arise through a change of hypothesis. ['opposition']\n",
      "This is clear from the following: since the nodes are about 17° Taurus and Scorpio, and the limits about 17° Leo and Aquarius, as will be said below, the additions and subtractions are made chiefly at 17° Cancer, 25° Virgo, 4° Scorpio, 27° Sagittarius, and 13° Pisces, intermediate points, and none at 21° Leo and 18° Scorpio, the nodes and the limit. ['nodes']\n",
      "They therefore had reason to believe that a planet is not divested of its second inequality unless the sun’s departure from the node is as great as the planet’s on its own orbit. ['node']\n",
      "Because of this, the following table, comparing the positions (referred to the orbit of Mars) with the mean positions of the sun at these moments, is presented. ['orbit']\n",
      "I am therefore missing something small in the mean longitude. ['longitude']\n",
      "There follows a table of Mars’s eccentric positions. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now the computed position on Mars’s orbit is 26° 24’ 43” Sagittarius. ['orbit']\n",
      "In the opinion of the table, 10’ 20” are to be subtracted from the latter to refer it to the ecliptic. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Therefore, the computed position on the ecliptic would be 26° 24’ 13” Sagittarius, a difference from opposition to the sun of 21’ 11”. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But it is now time for us to discuss in detail this adjusting to the ecliptic or to the planet's orbit, which serves as a foundation. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "First, the table provides us the following information from the observations: the northern latitude takes its rise from 18° Taurus, at which it was five minutes, reaches its observed maximum at 21° Leo, decreased thereafter and became only 1⅔° at 3° Scorpio, but right away at 27° Sagittarius it was south  and a rather large 4°, and still ['latitude']\n",
      "From this one concludes roughly that the ascending node is a little before 18° Taurus, and the descending node far beyond 3° Scorpio. ['node']\n",
      "The nodes will therefore be around 17° Taurus and 17° Scorpio, and the limits around 17° Leo and Aquarius. ['nodes']\n",
      "Since the plane of Mars’s eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit. ['eccentric']\n",
      "I use the term, “observed arcs”, because here one must mentally separate out the planet’s eccentricity, and proceed as though Mars’s path were in the orb of the fixed stars, exactly as is the ecliptic, and as though it really intersected the latter. ['observed']\n",
      "And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planet’s body intersects the ecliptic. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosius’s On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planet’s path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit. ['latitude']\n",
      "Consequently, the arc between the planet’s position on its orbit and the nearest node is always greater than that between its ecliptic position and the same node. ['orbit']\n",
      "Now when we observe the planets, we do not feel convinced that we have  defined their exact positions until we have referred them to the ecliptic. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "The ecliptic position is used, therefore, to aid our memory and comprehension. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But when, on the other hand, we compute the planet in its own hypothesis,1 we are not concerned with the ecliptic to which it is inclined, but with the exact path of the planet. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "compare the observed position with the computed position, we must either extend the arc between the ecliptic position and the nearer node, or abridge the arc between the body of the planet and the same node, so that from the former operation the position on the orbit might be given, and from the latter, the ecliptic position. ['observed']\n",
      "This is actually accomplished by adding or subtracting, according as the node precedes or follows the planet’s position. ['node']\n",
      "To continue: in the referring process which we have been considering, there are two things I would like to know, both of which I can seek using the same procedure  and diagram. ['diagram']\n",
      "Let A be the sidereal position of the node, AB the arc of the ecliptic, and upon it let AC be set equal to AB, and let the planet be observed beneath C. Further, from C let an arc be drawn perpendicular to the ecliptic, and let it be CE. ['sidereal']\n",
      "Now in the first place the ancients thought that since E is the position on the ecliptic and C the position of the orbit of the planet I, the planet is at the point opposite the sun when the sun is at E, the planet being observed at C. However, as was said above, those who constructed the tables thought that the planet is not exactly at opposition to the sun unless arc AB, ['ecliptic']\n",
      "the elongation of the place opposite the sun from the same node, is made equal to AC (the observed distance of the planet from the node). ['elongation']\n",
      "The planet is, indeed, seen in opposition to the sun at that time, but it really is not, and the advantage we seek from the planet’s opposition to the sun is more harmed by making AC and AB equal, than they themselves were hoping it would be corrected. ['opposition']\n",
      "For why are the planets observed at opposition to the sun? ['observed']\n",
      "In order, of course, that they then lack the second inequality of longitude. ['longitude']\n",
      "And when the point opposite the sun is at B and the planet is at C, both being between the nodes and the limits, the planet is more wrapped up in the second inequality of longitude than if the point opposite the sun were at E, the planet remaining at C. For let G be the sun, the center of the planetary system, at which all the orbs intersect the ecliptic, whether in the Copernican or the Brahean form. ['nodes']\n",
      "Let G be joined to A and E, points on the ecliptic, and let the earth be on the line EG, at H. Let HC be joined, and from H let the sun G be observed opposite E, while from the same point H let the planet be seen at C, its sidereal position along the line HC. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Let its point of intersection be F, and let a third arc AF be drawn from A through F to BC, cutting BC at D. It is obvious that the plane of the planet’s eccentric viewed from H towards C is set beneath AF, not AC, and that when the point opposite the sun is at E, the planet will really be beneath F, while when the point opposite the sun is located at B the planet is really going to be beneath D, although both do appear beneath C. But AD is shorter than the legs of the isosceles triangle BAC. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But it is likewise false that if the orbit of the planet were beneath AC, AB should on that account be taken equal to AC. ['orbit']\n",
      "For the orbit’s really being beneath AD is likewise not sufficient reason for taking AD equal to AB. ['orbit']\n",
      "For since the planet is observed at the point opposite the sun in order that it might shed the second inequality of longitude, while the longitude is to be reckoned on the planet’s true orbit, or on AD which stands above it, surely, unless the point opposite the sun falls upon the arc drawn through the planet at right angles to the orbit (that is, unless ADB is a right angle), the point B opposite the sun will not coincide in longitude with D. But if ADB is a right angle, AB is longer than AD. ['observed']\n",
      "For, given Mars’s ecliptic position E and apparent latitude EC, they computed the length of AC, and stated that the planet on its orbit was then distant from the node by their quantity AC. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Now the orbit of the planet (whose first inequality we are investigating) is not beneath AC, but beneath AD, as was just shown. ['orbit']\n",
      "Therefore, the arc AC has nothing to do with the first inequality, but adulterates the planet’s true elongations from A. And furthermore, the apparent latitude is EHC, while the true latitude of the point F, the inclination of the line GF to the ecliptic, is EGF. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "Thus, although the second inequality of longitude is swallowed up at opposition to the sun, the second inequality of latitude is nonetheless near its maximum there, and its measure is the angle HIG. ['longitude']\n",
      "Therefore, just as the whole latitude EC causes AC to be longer than AE by the arc EB, similarly, the part FC or HIG of this apparent latitude, which is a result of the second inequality, makes AC longer than AF. ['latitude']\n",
      "This error could also have been perceived in the inconstancy of the angle BAC, which they attributed to the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars's orbit. ['inclination']\n",
      "For the angles come out as in the accompanying table,  from which it is clear that in the northern semicircle they suppose an angle of maximum northern latitude of 4° 33’, and in the southern, of 6° 26’ south. ['latitude']\n",
      "According to this, at the subtending line connecting the nodes, which passes through the sun or earth, the plane of the eccentric would somehow be bent, since the upper part is less inclined than the lower. ['nodes']\n",
      "Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planet’s eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, the true procedure for referring the inclinations to the orbit is this: from the planet’s position E on the ecliptic, known from the observations, to find the angle of inclination EGF for that position, using the method that will follow below. ['orbit']\n",
      "And since, from arguments which I shall present below, it is clear that for the star Mars the angle EAF is not greater than about 1° 50’, the adjustment about 45° from the node (where it is maximum) accordingly does not exceed one minute, for which the table nonetheless has one add 8 or 10 minutes in certain places.

      "Finally, the reader should be advised that Tycho, in his table, claimed to have made use of the solar parallax in correcting the positions of Mars. ['solar']\n",
      "But it will now shortly be made clear that the parallax of Mars is a slippery and imperceptible business. ['parallax']\n",
      "However, this does not much affect the certainty of the positions in this table, as Mars can almost always be observed in mid-sky where it has no longitudinal parallax. ['observed']\n",
      "On the diurnal parallaxes of the star Mars. ['diurnal']\n",
      "For it is clear from Part I that the positions of Mars should be taken at the moments of true opposition to the sun. ['opposition']\n",
      "However, it is also clear that not every trace of the second inequality is thus removed, it being also necessary to refer the arc measured on the ecliptic to the planet’s orbit. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But the planet’s orbit must first be investigated by the inclination of the planes and by finding out the nodes. ['orbit']\n",
      "Again, the inclination and the nodes  cannot be found without knowing the diurnal parallax, at least if this should turn out to be relatively large. ['inclination']\n",
      "One must therefore start with the parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "In 1582, when Mars was opposite the sun in Cancer, I found the observation done with incredible care, with Tycho’s manuscript title, “For investigating the parallaxes of Mars”, from which you will, however, deduce either no parallax at all, or one exceedingly small. ['observation']\n",
      "I pass over without saying, that (as is customary) they compared the star Mars with nearby stars on the ecliptic, and frequently with ones at a great distance. ['star']\n",
      "Now it is usual to find the parallax of a mobile star (for Mars moves, with a retrograde motion when opposite the sun) by comparing morning and evening observations. ['parallax']\n",
      "As a result, it has happened that almost all the stars by which Mars was observed in the morning are different from those by which it was observed in the evening. ['observed']\n",
      "For a fixed star which is at hand in the morning (and higher than Mars), if it be near the ecliptic, has either set by evening (when Mars is in the west) or is rendered useless by refraction for this delicate procedure. ['fixed star']\n",
      "Another star therefore had to be substituted. ['star']\n",
      "But if the fixed stars are substituted for one another, there is always less trust in the procedure than if the same star should be retained. ['star']\n",
      "Brahe, however, announced to the learned world in many places that from the observations of that year, the parallax of Mars was found to be considerably greater than that of the sun. ['parallax']\n",
      "I did indeed find a chapter which professed to offer a procedure for investigating the parallax of Mars from the observations of that year. ['parallax']\n",
      "But here was something really surprising: they fitted the position of Mars found by observation into a Copernican diagram drawn very laboriously and carefully. ['observation']\n",
      "In this diagram, they took up the immense labor of solving all triangles created by the double epicycle on the concentric, in numbers replete with a great many digits. ['diagram']\n",
      "Finally, this was the goal of the calculation: to issue a pronouncement that the parallax of Mars is indeed greater than the solar parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "He wanted them to find out the parallax of Mars by comparing morning and evening observations with one another, but they had in fact found out how much parallax the Copernican diagram would bring about. ['parallax']\n",
      "Whether Brahe’s pronouncement on parallax was founded solely upon his trust in his assistants, is unknown to me ^1. ['parallax']\n",
      "On the night of 26 December,3 it passed between the second and seventh stars of Gemini,4 its distance (measured with the staff) from the head of the lower of the Twins (the second star) being 2° 25’ or 2° 26’, but from the seventh, ['star']\n",

      "the eye of Taurus,5 whose latitude is 5° 31’ south, longitude 4° 12½’ Gemini, in 1600. ['latitude']\n",
      "Hence, Mars’s longitude as if the year were 1600 is 17° 53⅓’ Cancer,6 or, at the end of 1582, 17° 38’ Cancer, at an altitude of 40° 50’. ['longitude']\n",
      "It is thus beyond the effects of refraction. ['refraction']\n",
      "Again, at 7h 15m on the morning of December 27, it was 36° 43’ from Cor Leonis,7 whose latitude is 0° 26½’; hence, its longitude at the end of 1582 is 17° 28⅓’ Cancer, altitude 14° 4’, and thus affected by refraction. ['latitude']\n",
      "Therefore, from 8h 28½m in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46½m, it was observed to retrogress 9⅔’. ['interval']\n",
      "For the diurnal motion, on the 29th at 7h 47m, the distance of Mars from the southern foot of Erichthonius8 was 29° 38½’ But on the 30th at 8h 8m the distance from the same star was 29° 13½ ^9. ['diurnal']\n",
      "And this diurnal motion remained the same on the 27th. ['diurnal']\n",
      "On the previous evening, when Mars was rising farther to the east (because it was retrograde), parallax moved it eastward, and in the morning, when it was setting and was farther to the west, parallax moved it westward. ['east']\n",
      "So, just as the moon’s diurnal parallax apparently slows its motion, the same parallax in turn quickens Mars’s retrograde motion. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Therefore, if parallax is perceived, it is perceived through an excessively enlarged diurnal motion. ['parallax']\n",
      "Therefore, there is no parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "Again, refraction is perceived as contrary to parallax. ['refraction']\n",
      "Now the refraction at altitude 13° is 4’ from the table of fixed stars, and 8’ from the table of the sun,10 and only a very small part of this affects the longitude, as Cancer descends quite obliquely. ['refraction']\n",
      "So the refraction in longitude comes to three minutes at most, which, added to 9⅔’, makes the refraction-free motion 12⅔’ over 10¾ hours, which motion, if it also were free from parallax, ought to have been 11½’. ['refraction']\n",
      "Therefore, the excess of 1⅓’ is the longitudinal parallax for the two observations—clearly minimal, untrustworthy, and entirely contemptible. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23° 29’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51°. ['star']\n",
      "The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43° 58’ from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15°. ['altitude']\n",
      "And so, since Mars’s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "On January 16 at 10½h it was 23° 27’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius. ['star']\n",
      "On January 17 at 10⅗h 12 it was 23° 12½’ from the same star. ['star']\n",
      "Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14½’. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23° 29’, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43° 52’, at 7½h in the evening, which at 5h in the morning was 43° 58’, 6 minutes greater. ['star']\n",
      "The time interval is 9½ hours, to which ought to correspond 5⅝’ of the diurnal motion. ['interval']\n",
      "Here, therefore, the  sum of the two parallaxes is no more than ⅜’ except that the amount of Mars’s longitudinal refraction at 15° is added to it. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "For Cancer and Leo are setting extremely obliquely, and Mars's large northern latitude put it at nearly the same altitude as Cor Leonis. ['latitude']\n",
      "We are left with a longitudinal parallax of no more than 1’. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "Refraction does not affect anything, since in both instances the altitude of Mars was about 30°. ['altitude']\n",
      "Likewise, at 7h 34m its distance from the seventh star of Gemini14 was 7° 51’. ['star']\n",
      "At 4h 52m in the morning, it was 7° 59’ from the same star. ['star']\n",
      "Of this star (at the shoulder of Gemini), Brahe wrote, “Note that I am taking Mars’s distance from this star because its course passes through it, as it were, so that the morning and evening distances compared might show the parallax.” I have reproduced this here so that the reader may rest assured that Brahe did not proceed without a purpose. ['star']\n",
      "Our profit is about 1½’ of parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "But now let us calculate, for January 17, how much of an increase in the hourly motion should result from a parallax greater than the solar parallax as usually accepted. ['parallax']\n",
      "Since we consider the sun’s parallax to be three minutes, let Mars have four. ['parallax']\n",
      "It follows that the motion of mars over those hours should have appeared 4’ greater than what follows proportionally from the diurnal motion. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Since this is repudiated by the observations, Mars’s parallax is found – often none at all. ['parallax']\n",
      "There was even an occasional note in Brahe’s hand saying, “It strayed over to the wrong side.” So this is the first way of investigating Mars’s parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "Now at this very time, 1604, at which I am considering parallax (whether that of the sun more than Mars’s is hard to say, for my Hipparchus18 requires Mars’s aid even in the lunar eclipses), a very suitable occasion for observation arose, if only the climate zone had been different and Mars had moved a little higher. ['parallax']\n",
      "For about 19/29 February19 of this year 1604, Mars was stationary both in longitude and in latitude at the same time. ['longitude']\n",
      "This occurred in Libra, and therefore from Mars’s rising to the sun’s rising the angle of the horizon with the ecliptic continually decreased. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "9 of the Astronomiae Optica20 the latitudinal parallax, if any, continually increases. ['parallax']\n",
      "But from the increment (found through the columns of the parallactic table21 opposite the initial and final angles of the ecliptic with the horizon), the whole horizontal parallax (at the front of the column) is known. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "On the night between Thursday and Friday, which was February 17/27, while Corvus was on the meridian, there was 9° 44’ between Mars and Spica, and between it and the Northern Pan,23 17° 41’; and between Mars and Arcturus, 29° 13’. ['meridian']\n",
      "Also, to test the sextant, we measured the interval between Arcturus and Spica as 32° 57’, which should have been 33° 1’ 45”, as is clear if you calculate it using the right ascensions and declinations, or latitudes and longitudes, which Tycho assigned to these stars in Book I of the Progymnasmata ^24. ['interval']\n",
      "I then used the quadrant to obtain the meridian altitude of Mars, 32° 4’, and of Spica, 30° 50’. ['meridian']\n",
      "However, the altitude of Spica showed that my perpendicular was not well enough set up. ['altitude']\n",
      "For the altitude of the equator, at my location, is 39° 54’. ['altitude']\n",
      "Accordingly, the meridian altitude of Spica is 30° 52’, and of Mars, 32° 6’. ['meridian']\n",
      "Now, from the declination of Mars and its distance from the fixed star, its right ascension comes out: 26 ['fixed star']\n",
      "But from this right ascension, I first select,  from Tycho’s table of right ascensions, the degree of the right sphere that was riding at the same time, 28° 1’ 0” Libra,27 whose declination, from another of that author’s tables,28 is 10° 48’ 30” [South]. ['ascension']\n",
      "Therefore, Mars is distant from the ecliptic, the oblique path, by 3° 0’ 30” on the circle of declination. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But the angle which the circle of declination makes with the ecliptic is 68° 59’ from the appropriate table. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "And in my table of parallax,29 under the heading of 60’, I find, opposite 68° 59’, the entry 56’ 1”. ['parallax']\n",
      "But since I have thrice 60’ in this distance of Mars from the ecliptic (which I call the base of the latitude  ), I multiply what I extracted under 60’ by 3 ^30. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "This gives me a latitude of 2° 48’ 31”. ['latitude']\n",
      "To test the latitude of Mars, I also consulted the distance from Arcturus, through the star’s latitude and longitude provided from Tycho, and Mars’s longitudinal position just found, and it replied to me that Mars was at a latitude of 2° 47’ 48”. ['latitude']\n",
      "And the altitude of Mars was then 11°. ['altitude']\n",
      "Later, the back of Leo31 culminated at altitude 62° 37’, according to a corrected plumb line. ['altitude']\n",
      "Thus the altitude of the equator was shown to be 39° 55’: almost correct. ['altitude']\n",
      "At that moment, Mars’s altitude was 23°. ['altitude']\n",
      "For first, when Mars was near the horizon, refraction moved it toward  Arcturus, later letting it drops down when Mars had acquired some altitude. ['refraction']\n",
      "Vindemiatrix32 showed a meridian altitude of 53° 5’, a little greater than it should have had. ['meridian']\n",
      "The altitude of Mars at culmination was 32° 6’, the same as it had been two days before, and of Arcturus, a correct 61° 13’. ['altitude']\n",
      "Now since, according to the Prutenic Tables and to my computations, Mars was stationary in longitude at this time, there could be no change in meridian altitude resulting from its wandering about on the ecliptic. ['longitude']\n",
      "For this reason, since the meridian altitude remained quite the same (for my instrument allows an uncertainty of one minute), neither did any change in the latitude occur during this time. ['meridian']\n",
      "Therefore, when the fifth star of Leo36 culminated, with the arm of the instrument fixed above 29° 13½’ the distance was now more, while no error could be found at 29° 15’. ['star']\n",
      "When the observation was finished, Saturn preceded the meridian by less than Jupiter preceded Saturn. ['observation']\n",
      "Later, it appeared to the investigators to be between 29° 12’ and 29° 13’, as it was now higher and free from refraction. ['refraction']\n",
      "For at the end of this observation it had an altitude of 19⅙’. ['observation']\n",
      "The Tail of Leo38 was about half a degree from the meridian. ['meridian']\n",
      "The altitude of Mars was then 24¾°. ['altitude']\n",
      "The Tail of Leo, when culminating, had the correct altitude of 56° 44’, within one minute. ['altitude']\n",
      "When one third of the distance between Mars and Spica had crossed the meridian, it [i.e., the distance to Arcturus] first appeared to us to be 29° 9½’, but the cylinder was not well enough applied, as it was too long. ['meridian']\n",
      "Mars culminated at an altitude of 32° 19½’. ['altitude']\n",
      "Also, the distance between Spica and the northern star in the head of Scorpius41 was 39° 32½’, which should have been 39° 26½’. ['star']\n",
      "For unless you diminish Mars’s distance from the fixed stars by 5 minutes, the right ascension measured through Spica and through the Pan will be discrepant by 10 minutes, but if (as required by the examination of the sextant) the five minutes be subtracted, they will coincide exactly, and will be 205° 27’ 10”, with declination 7° 35½’. ['ascension']\n",
      "Therefore, the position is 26° 18’ 48” Libra, with latitude 2° 47’ 20”. ['latitude']\n",
      "You see that the latitude is manifestly the same, though meanwhile the planet had retrogressed 38’ in longitude. ['latitude']\n",
      "But when Saturn had passed the meridian by one degree, the distance could not admit 29° 13½’; nevertheless, it was greater than 29° 12½’, about 29° 13’. ['meridian']\n",
      "In both, Mars was 29° 18’ from Arcturus, and in both, its meridian altitude was 32° 7’ or 6’. ['meridian']\n",
      "Therefore the distance changed about 4¼’ over the interval. ['interval']\n",
      "And since Arcturus and Mars have very nearly the same longitude,46 this change of distance bespeaks a variation of latitudinal parallax. ['longitude']\n",
      "I also know that when the Mouth of Leo is on the meridian Mars is 12½° high and is somewhat affected by refraction. ['meridian']\n",
      "Now the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57⅓° (about) when the Mouth of Leo was culminating, but finally, after the Heart of Scorpius had culminated, it was 20⅓°. ['altitude']\n",
      "Therefore, the maximum parallax of Mars would be 9’. ['parallax']\n",
      "And since, on that day, the distance of Mars and earth was to the distance of Mars and the sun as 28 is to 60 (given approximately by an anticipatory acquaintance with the hypotheses of Tycho and Copernicus), the ratio of the parallaxes will be the inverse of this, and the maximum  solar parallax will be about 4’ 24”. ['solar']\n",
      "But now let us consider that at an altitude of 12½° Mars would be subject to refraction, if the table of fixed star refractions constructed at Hven is valid for Prague. ['altitude']\n",
      "At this altitude, it was 4’ 20”, 2’ 18” of which is owed to the latitude, by which Mars is caused to be closer to Arcturus. ['altitude']\n",
      "If, however, we apply the sun’s refraction to Mars (as it often appears we should), it is 8’ 45” at this altitude, twice as great. ['refraction']\n",
      "Therefore, the latitudinal parallax would also be twice as great, 4’ 36”. ['parallax']\n",
      "In this way, the whole difference which observation imposes upon itself, at these two different moments, would be due entirely to refraction. ['observation']\n",
      "Reckoning it in the former way would leave a latitudinal parallax of 2’ – the difference in parallax in the column whose heading is 5’. ['parallax']\n",
      "This would give the sun only 2’ 25” of maximum parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "So refraction makes our third day, too, suspect and doubtful, and ultimately quite worthless. ['refraction']\n",
      "I know that since Arcturus and Mars are 9 degrees apart,48 which is one third of the amount by which Arcturus’s latitude exceeds Mars’s, it comes out that not all the latitudinal refraction is subtracted from the distances from Mars, and that the parallax changes Mars’s latitude more than it changes this distance from Arcturus. ['latitude']\n",
      "Now on the fourth day, what seems to have been accomplished is nothing other than the total destruction of Mars’s parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "The meridian distance ought to have been 29° 9½’ with an accurate instrument, and consequently 29° 14’ with the faulty one. ['meridian']\n",
      "But at the end it was found to be 29° 13½’, when the latitudinal parallax (had there been any) ought to have been greater, and hence the distance from Arcturus greater. ['parallax']\n",
      "Hence, from that time when Mars attained an altitude of 19°, the distance was found to be 29° 12½’, and one minute greater at the end. ['altitude']\n",
      "This would be a very small parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "When its altitude was 9 degrees (when Hydra was culminating), the distance was 29° 9’ with a faulty instrument, and still subject to refraction. ['altitude']\n",
      "Later, at an altitude of 25° and near the meridian, it was again 29° 9’, measured twice at different moments. ['altitude']\n",
      "Could the refraction have been zero initially, that the arc thus remain constant? ['refraction']\n",
      "Still, it is at least established by these observations, whatever their quality, that Mars’s parallaxes of latitude are not greater than 4’, which is the amount of uncertainty in the instrument. ['latitude']\n",
      "It is more credible that the parallax is very small. ['parallax']\n",
      "That the parallaxes of Mars are greater than the sun’s, on the other hand, is argued by the proportion in the Tychonic and Copernican hypothesis; and from this proportion Mars’s parallax could easily be computed if we were certain of the sun’s parallax. ['parallax']\n",
      "Is, then, the procedure for finding the sun’s altitude and parallax from eclipses uncertain? ['altitude']\n",
      "Furthermore, it is now clear that nothing of any importance is wanting in Mars’s diurnal parallax as taken by Tycho. ['diurnal']\n",
      "I shall therefore move on, little by little, towards the reduction of the observed positions of Mars to the point opposite the sun’s apparent position. ['observed']\n",
      "As a first step, we must find the nodes. ['nodes']\n",
      "In the diagram of Ch. ['diagram']\n",
      "9, let A be the position of the node, E the planet’s position on the ecliptic in 1595, C the observed sidereal position of the planet, 17° 56’ 5” Taurus, EC the observed latitude, 0° 5’ 15” north. ['node']\n",
      "Now it is presupposed that the angle EAC is very nearly 4° 34½’, the same as the maximum northern latitude observed in the same way in 1585. ['latitude']\n",
      "In the right triangle CEA (or the isosceles triangle CBA; the difference is unimportant in this procedure), from side CE and angle EAC he sought the length EA, the distance of the ecliptic position from the node. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "the node. ['node']\n",
      "9 that the angle EAC is not constant; hence, through different latitudes of different oppositions they will also show different positions for the node. ['node']\n",
      "Nor is EAC as great as the maximum apparent latitude, because AC is a curved arc; and neither is it AC, but some path inside (AF, say), that is the planet’s path as it would be seen from the center of the sun. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "Therefore, A will not necessarily be the node, at least as found through this operation. ['node']\n",
      "I, therefore, investigated the nodes differently, using observations on the day on which they were at the node. ['nodes']\n",
      "My presupposition was that when the planet, in its eccentric position, is truly at the node, it can by no disposition of the earth or sun be made to appear elsewhere than at the node. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For in the Copernican hypothesis, this in itself is in agreement with the nature of things: that the moving faculty of any star is not bound to observe a star foreign to it (including the earth), but has its own laws governing its circuit. ['star']\n",
      "In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, this would be exactly as if one were to say that the epicycle pays heed, not to a line from the sun through its own center, but to certain positions beneath the fixed stars, beneath which  it places the planet in the plane of the ecliptic. ['epicycle']\n",
      "In the Tychonic system, the same will be said of the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "N, and the right ascension was 22° 35’ 10” ^2. ['ascension']\n",
      "Hence, its position comes out as 24° 22’ 56” Aries, and its latitude as 3’ 12” south. ['latitude']\n",
      "Parallax and refraction were opposite and approximately equal, and are therefore ignored. ['refraction']\n",
      "On 1592 January 23 at 10h 15m in the evening, Mars was at 11° 34’ 30” Aries with latitude 0° 2’ south ^3. ['latitude']\n",
      "The altitude of Mars was 25°, and therefore (from the table for the fixed stars),4 there was no refraction. ['altitude']\n",
      "The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5. ['parallax']\n",
      "Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic. ['latitude']\n",
      "For on February 6 it was already at about 7’ northern latitude ^6. ['latitude']\n",
      "On the evening of 1593 December 10, Mars was observed at the ascending node. ['observed']\n",
      "For after correction of the horizontal variations it retained no more than 0° 0’ 45” north latitude ^7. ['north']\n",
      "On 1595 October 27 at 12h 20m, Mars's true latitude after the removal of parallax was 0° 2’ 20” south ^8. ['latitude']\n",
      "On the 28th, when the parallax had similarly been removed, the latitude was 0° 0’ 25” north ^9. ['parallax']\n",

      "Counting backwards 687 days, the number of days in Mars’s revolution on its eccentric, starting from noon on 28 October, the end will fall on 1593 December 10, while on the preceding night Mars was observed near the node. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This will end up at 1592 January 23, when the planet was observed right at the node. ['observed']\n",
      "If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh. ['latitude']\n",
      "From this it is known that it makes no difference where the earth is, either in sidereal position or with respect to Mars. ['sidereal']\n",
      "In the Ptolemaic system, it makes no difference where the sun is with respect to the center of Mars’s epicycle and where Mars is on the epicycle, and in the Tychonic system, it makes no difference where the center of the eccentric or the sun is located with respect to the line from Mars through the earth, so drawn that Mars lies in the plane of the ecliptic. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For the diameter of the nodes is always the same in Copernicus and Ptolemy, and in Tycho it is always parallel to itself, except that over the ages the nodes move slightly. ['nodes']\n",
      "Now let us find the opposite node. ['node']\n",
      "I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8°, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0° 3’ 46” N, and it was itself at 13° 36’ 40” Sagittarius ^11. ['observed']\n",
      "The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun. ['parallax']\n",
      "This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13. ['altitude']\n",
      "Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude—about 2 or 3, or even more. ['refraction']\n",
      "On the night of 1589 April 15 Mars's observed latitude was 1° 7’ north ^14. ['observed']\n",
      "The parallax of the annual orb was drastically increased, owing to the approach of Mars and earth. ['parallax']\n",
      "After 21 days, the latitude decreased to a paltry 6⅔’ north ^15. ['latitude']\n",
      "And thus, although on May 6 it decreased somewhat more slowly, since the star was moving away from the earth, we shall still not be far wrong if we extrapolate proportionally: we make 21 days be to the number of days after which Mars falls upon the ecliptic, as 60 minutes of diminution is to the 6⅔ minutes remaining. ['star']\n",
      "This rule shows it to be two and one third days, so that Mars was at the node on May 9. ['node']\n",
      "On this day, Mars ought to have been at the node, and for the next 5 days—up to the morning of January 4—it should have been moving off southward. ['node']\n",
      "And indeed, from observations of it on January 4, we have given it a few minutes of south latitude. ['south']\n",
      "Mars was not observed more frequently at this eccentric position. ['observed']\n",
      "It is enough that we have this 1595 observation, provided that it does not disagree with us. ['observation']\n",
      "For, as will appear in the course of this work, the latitude is most attenuated at conjunction with the sun (as in 1595), owing to the parallaxes of the annual orb, and at opposition (as in 1589) it is augmented. ['latitude']\n",
      "It is therefore fitting that the diurnal motion in latitude appear less in 1595, and greater in 1589. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Now, how are the sidereal positions of the two nodes found? ['sidereal']\n",
      "Whether you do this with the help of the Prutenic or Tychonic tables, taking into account the true precession of the equinox, you will find that on the morning of 1594 December 30, the mean position of Mars is 27° 14½’ Scorpio, and on the morning of 1595 October 28 it was at 5° 31’ Taurus. ['precession']\n",
      "It therefore appears that the diameter of the nodes does not pass through the center of equable motion,16 but far beneath it. ['nodes']\n",
      "Accordingly, the one comes out to be 15° 44½’ Scorpio, and the other, 16° 48’ Taurus, which are Mars’s equated eccentric positions ^17. ['eccentric']\n",
      "As you see, the nodes are nearly opposite one another at about 16⅓˚ Taurus and Scorpio, when viewed from the center of the planetary system, which Ptolemy described as a point very near the earth, and Copernicus and Tycho as a point very near the sun. ['nodes']\n",
      "Further, it will be seen in Part 5 below how much we are going to change these positions of the nodes when we change the equations by transposing the theory of the sun from the sun's mean position to its apparent position. ['nodes']\n",
      "Investigation of the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of the orbit of Mars. ['inclination']\n",
      "In the previous chapter, the nodes and limits have been found quite accurately according to the opinions of Tycho Brahe and myself. ['nodes']\n",
      "Now it is to be inquired what exactly the inclination of the plane of Mars’s orbit is to the plane of the ecliptic. ['inclination']\n",
      "For the angle of this inclination is set up around the center of the planetary system, which for Copernicus and Tycho is the sun. ['inclination']\n",
      "But the eye cannot be placed at the sun so that this inclination might thence appear beneath the fixed stars and be measured, and the maximum distance of the limit from the ecliptic, seen from another place, will also be seen under another angle. ['inclination']\n",
      "For it will be demonstrated that the plane of the epicycle always remains parallel to the plane of the ecliptic. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, place the center of the plane of the epicycle at either limit, and let the planet lie on the same line of longitude passing from the center of vision through the center of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "The planet will then either be more distant than the center of the epicycle from the observer, and thus its distance from the ecliptic will appear less than the distance of the center of the epicycle from the same ecliptic, or it will be nearer to the observer, and will thus appear greater than what we seek. ['epicycle']\n",
      "In this difficulty we may take consolation from this one circumstance: that the purpose for which we seek to know the inclination as one of our principles is not such as to require the highest accuracy. ['inclination']\n",
      "It will consequently permit us to use those means which furnish indirect evidence of the quantity of the inclination: we shall offer three of these. ['inclination']\n",
      "Now it is apparent from what has just been said that it will be most directly helpful to us if we find an observation of the star Mars at that moment at which Mars is reported to be equidistant from the sun and the earth and on the line drawn from the sun to 16° or 17° Leo or Aquarius (the positions of the limits). ['observation']\n",
      "In the Ptolemaic form, this is where the center of the epicycle is at 16° or 17° Leo or Aquarius and Mars is as far from the earth as is the center of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Let B be the sun, A the earth, and upon AB let the isosceles triangle ABC be set up, with C the planet’s position in the plane of the ecliptic; and, CE being drawn perpendicular to the orbit of Mars, let the body of Mars be at E. EC will therefore appear the same whether seen from B the sun or A the earth —this is immediately evident. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Consequently, BA, the position opposite the sun’s, should make with BC, the eccentric position of Mars, an angle less than 90°, in order that CAB and CBA be equal. ['eccentric']\n",
      "In the Ptolemaic form, if C be the earth, A the center of the epicycle, and B Mars, CAB will not be able to be right, as CA and CB are to be made equal. ['epicycle']\n",
      "If you wish to work a little more precisely, take from Copernicus or from an anticipation of Tycho’s reformation the approximate ratio 1525:1000 as (in Copernicus) the ratio of the orbits of Mars and earth, (in Tycho) of Mars and the sun, or (in Ptolemy) of the eccentric and the epicycle. ['eccentric']\n",
      "In the last instance, suitable observations are lacking, since Mars in Aries, on account of its small ascension (where the sun in Gemini makes the nights bright) can hardly be observed, or even be seen at all. ['ascension']\n",
      "Accordingly, on 1588 November 10 at 6h 30m in the morning the planet Mars was seen at 25° 31’ Virgo, with a latitude of 1° 36’ 45” north, the sun being at 21 Scorpio ^4. ['latitude']\n",
      "Consequently, its latitude at that place appeared less than was the true inclination. ['latitude']\n",
      "On December 5 following, at 6h in the morning, Mars was seen at 9° 19⅖’ Libra, with a latitude of 1° 53½’ N., the sun being at 23° Sagittarius ^5. ['latitude']\n",
      "Therefore, since the sun was 73½° from Mars, the digression of the point which Mars then occupied on its orbit was a little less than 1° 53½’ (since there should have been  72° between Mars and the sun). ['digression']\n",
      "The apparent magnitude of the inclination—at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic—is consequently greater. ['inclination']\n",
      "But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1° 50’. ['inclination']\n",
      "Similarly, on 1586 October 22 at 6h in the morning, about dawn, there was about 6° 9’ eastward between Mars and Cor Leonis ^6. ['eastward']\n",
      "The declination of Mars from the equator was 13° 0’ 40” north. ['north']\n",
      "Hence, its apparent longitude is found to be 0° 7’ Virgo,7 latitude 1° 36’ 6” N ^8. ['apparent longitude']\n",
      "And so the apparent latitude was less than the true digression of the planet from the ecliptic, and this was, in fact, long before it reached the limit. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "But on November 2 at 4⅔h in the morning, with the sun at 19⅖° Scorpio, Mars was seen at 5° 52’ Virgo, with latitude 1° 47’ N ^9. ['latitude']\n",
      "Therefore the latitude at this position appeared about right, although exactly at the limit it is reckoned to be greater than 1° 47’, namely, about 1° 50’. ['latitude']\n",
      "Hence is found its longitude, 20° 4’ 30” Virgo, and latitude, 2° 16’ 30”, with the sun at 18° Sagittarius, which is 88° from Mars. ['longitude']\n",
      "It should have been only 72½.° Therefore the line between Mars and the earth is made less than that between Mars and the sun, and because of the lesser distance, the digression appeared greater than it really was. ['digression']\n",
      "At this point, therefore, the digression from the ecliptic was less than 2° 16½’. ['digression']\n",
      "So here the magnitude of the maximum inclination is indirectly confirmed to be 1° 50’. ['inclination']\n",
      "On the other hand, on 1583 April 22, at 9¾h in the night, an interval of 20° 58’ was observed between Mars and the Dog12 and 22° 47½’ between Mars and Cor Leonis ^13. ['interval']\n",
      "Hence, the position of Mars is found to be 1° 17’ Leo, with latitude 1° 50⅔’ north. ['latitude']\n",
      "Therefore, its observed latitude is greater than its true digression from the ecliptic. ['observed']\n",
      "So at the limit, is digression will again be greater. ['digression']\n",
      "Therefore, the opposite causes again cancel one another, and the maximum inclination is 1° 50’. ['inclination']\n",
      "Likewise, at 8h in the evening on 1596 March 9, it was observed at 15° 49’ Gemini, with latitude 1° 49⅔’ north ^14. ['observed']\n",
      "Therefore, Mars’s true digression from the ecliptic was a little less than the observed latitude. ['digression']\n",
      "However, this digression was not at its maximum, since Mars had not yet approached within about 25 degrees of the limit. ['digression']\n",
      "So once again, indirect support is provided for a maximum digression of about 1° 50’ at the limit. ['digression']\n",
      "On 1589 September 15 at 7¼h in the evening, Mars was observed at 16° 47⅓’ Sagittarius with 1° 41⅔’ southern latitude ^15. ['observed']\n",
      "But when the correction for refraction of light which it underwent at this low altitude is applied, its position was 16° 45⅔’, with latitude 1° 52⅓’ south. ['refraction']\n",
      "Therefore, the observed latitude is a little greater than the digression of its position from the ecliptic. ['observed']\n",
      "On November 1 following, at 6⅙h, it was seen at 20° 59¼ Capricorn, with latitude 1° 36’ south, the sun being at 19° Scorpio ^16. ['latitude']\n",
      "Therefore, the apparent latitude is less than the true digression from the ecliptic. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "But at the same time, the digression at this point is less than the digression at the limit, because this point is beyond the limit. ['digression']\n",
      "Therefore, the maximum inclination is much greater than 1° 36’, and by all indications is about as great as the apparent latitude on September 15, namely, 1° 50’, approximately. ['inclination']\n",
      "The observations followed this method within the limits of calculation, indicating readily enough the maximum inclination of the planes. ['inclination']\n",
      "Let the plane of the ecliptic be ACDB, the plane of Mars’s orbit AEFB, and let them intersect one another in AB. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Let the sun be at A, the earth at B, and from A and B, perpendicular to AB, let AC and BD be set up in the plane of the ecliptic, and AE and BF in the orbit of Mars. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Let the planet be at F. The inclination EAC of the limit E will be equal to the apparent latitude of the planet at F, namely, FBD. ['inclination']\n",
      "You will therefore note that if ever there is a perfect quadrature of the sun and Mars, with the line BA, that is, the sun, at 16° or 17° Taurus or 16° or 17° Scorpio—where between the line BA from earth to sun (which in this instance is also the line of intersection of the planes), and the line BF from earth to Mars, there is 90° or one quadrant intervening—then, whatever the apparent latitude of Mars FBD will be there, that will also be the maximum inclination of the planes EAC, although at that place F, Mars is not as far from the ecliptic as at E. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "The sun was at 11 Taurus, five or six degrees below the node. ['node']\n",
      "On this  account, the apparent latitude will be greater than the truth, since it is seen from nearer. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "On the other hand, since there are not 90° between the sun and Mars, the apparent latitude will on this account be less than the truth. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "On the supposition that these opposite deviations cancel one another, the inclination of the planes will approximately equal the observed latitude. ['inclination']\n",
      "The observed latitude was 1° 50⅔’. ['observed']\n",
      "Therefore, the inclination of the planes is approximately that much. ['inclination']\n",
      "On 1584 October 30, there was a select occasion, but no observation is available. ['observation']\n",
      "However, on November 12 following, at 1½h in the night, when the sun had already fallen about 14° or 15° below the diameter of intersection, the earth having risen that much (for Copernicus), or the diameter of intersection having fallen that much toward the earth (for Tycho), Mars was seen at 23° 14’ Leo with latitude 2° 12⅖’ north, while the sun was at 1° Sagittarius ^17. ['latitude']\n",
      "This angle is somewhat diminished owing to the inclination of Mars’s line of vision to the line of intersection. ['inclination']\n",
      "Therefore, the inclination is much less than 2° 12’, namely, 1° 50’. ['inclination']\n",
      "On 1585 April 26 at 9h 42m, Mars was seen at 21° 26’ Leo with latitude 1° 49¾’ north ^18. ['latitude']\n",
      "The sun was at 16° Taurus, right near the node. ['node']\n",
      "Therefore, the angle of maximum inclination of the planes was only a little greater than 1° 49¾’; that is, 1° 50’ or a little greater. ['inclination']\n",
      "Similarly, near the other limit, on 1591 October 16 at 6h 30m in the evening, Mars was seen at 1° 27⅓’ Aquarius with latitude 2° 10⅚’ south, decreasing ^19. ['latitude']\n",
      "(For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2° 18⅔’,20 and on October 2 it was 2° 38½‘.) ['latitude']\n",
      "The sun was at 2½° Scorpio, above the node. ['node']\n",
      "The earth was therefore below the node towards Mars. ['node']\n",
      "So because of this proximity, the observed latitude was greater than the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic. ['observed']\n",
      "Fourteen days later, when the sun was at the node, if it were again to have decreased 28 minutes (the amount of decrease in the previous 14 days), there would remain 1° 45’. ['node']\n",
      "But the ratio of decrease does not remain the same when the earth departs from a star, or vice versa. ['star']\n",
      "Therefore nothing can be adduced here against a maximum inclination of 1° 50’. ['inclination']\n",
      "Let BA be a line drawn from the earth through the body of the sun at the place of the node, 17° Scorpio or Taurus, and let the planet be observed at any point whatever on the zodiac. ['node']\n",
      "Now the latitude which it appears to have measures the inclination of a point on the plane truly removed from the limit by an amount equal to Mars’s apparent removal from the limit. ['latitude']\n",
      "Let Mars be observed on BG. ['observed']\n",
      "The apparent latitude of point G seen from B will be the same as the inclination of point H. And BG and AH are directed towards the same sidereal degree, because they are parallel. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "For example, in the observation of 1585 April 26, the sun was at 16° Taurus, and Mars was observed at 21° 26’ Leo, with latitude 1° 49¾’. ['observation']\n",
      "Therefore, the inclination at the eccentric motion of 21° 26’ Leo is 1° 49¾’. ['inclination']\n",
      "And since 21° 26’ Leo is 5° from the limit, and the sine of 85° is 1/250 less than the whole sine,21 the maximum inclination here will be greater by 1/250 of it, that is, about 1° 50½‘. ['inclination']\n",
      "And because D is Mars, a line drawn from D parallel to BA will pass through the center of the epicycle C (since the motion of Mars on its epicycle follows the motion of the sun in its orb). ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, since AC will not be at 17° Leo or Aquarius, it will not be so far from the ecliptic as the northern limit E. D will likewise not stand so far from the ecliptic as E, because CD and all the points of the epicycle are equally distant from the ecliptic, since the plane of the epicycle, in order to make the hypothesis equivalent, is supposed always to remain parallel to the plane of the ecliptic. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But proportionally as D or C is less distant from the ecliptic than E, D is closer to A than E, with the result that the distance D may be seen from A as proportionally greater, and both may be seen under the same angle from A. Now, according to spherical trigonometry, as the distance of C from the ecliptic is to the distance of E from the ecliptic, so is the sine of arc CB (that is, AD) to the whole sine AE, because ECB is a circle inclined above AB. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "But C and D are equally distant from the ecliptic, as was just said. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Therefore, AD is to AE as the distance of D (or the perpendicular drawn from D to the ecliptic) is to the perpendicular from E. Therefore, the triangles ADD and AEE will be similar, since they have right angles at points D and E on the ecliptic, and the sides are proportional. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Also, they will be concurrent, since the sides (AD, AE) are drawn in the plane of the ecliptic through the same point A, and are directed toward the same point of longitude, 17° Leo or Aquarius. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Therefore, the lines AD, AE in the orbit are also concurrent; that is, the line extended from the earth A through Mars D at this position will hit upon E, the center of the epicycle, when it is at the limit. ['orbit']\n",
      "Thus the angles of maximum inclination and of observed latitude of Mars will be the same at this place. ['inclination']\n",
      "In Tycho’s table of oppositions, the apparent latitude at 21° 16’ Leo was 4° 32⅙’22 ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "Let A be the sun, B the earth, C Mars on the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus the line AE running out through the earth B among the fixed stars will intersect the ecliptic, and AC will intersect the orbit of Mars. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "In this manner, from any given acronychal observation with a comparatively great latitude, the inclination is found, first, of that point on the orbit, and then at its maximum, by considering the distance from the node or limit. ['observation']\n",
      "For example, on 1593 August 24, the apparent latitude at opposition to the sun comes out to be 6° 3’ south ^24. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "However, this position is about 26° from the limit, 64° from the node. ['node']\n",
      "So, as the sine of 64° is to this digression from the ecliptic of 1° 42’, so is the whole sine to the maximum inclination of the planes, which comes out to be 1° 53’. ['digression']\n",
      "In the Ptolemaic form, A will be the earth, C the center of Mars’s epicycle, and D the lowest point on the epicycle, since Mars is situated at opposition to the sun. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And because the sun’s line EA is on the ecliptic, while the plane of the epicycle is set up parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, CD will be parallel to EA. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Therefore, BAC and ACD, the inclinations of the eccentric and the epicycle, are equal. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But, owing to the full equivalence of the hypotheses, CD is equal to BA; that is, as AB is to AC in Copernicus, so is the semidiameter of the Ptolemaic epicycle DC to CA, the line from the earth to the center of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, CDA and CBA are equal, and EBC and BAD are equal: the apparent latitude. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "For when he decided to make the plane of the epicycle tip every which way (it not being immediately clear, through the mists of his hypothesis, that the plane of the epicycle is parallel to the plane of the ecliptic), he contrived the latitude from three components, and in order that contraries counterbalance one another,*  utterly wrenched his epicycle from its parallel position. ['epicycle']\n",
      "As a consequence, you may see that in the usual computation (e.g., in Magini’s Ephemerides) there is no conjunction whatever of Mars and the sun that is not,  as they say, “through the body“. ['conjunction']\n",
      "Instead, in order to reproduce these as well, he fabricated librations of the planes of the eccentrics, in which the angle of inclination (which for  Ptolemy was fixed) would be varied. ['inclination']\n",
      "Moreover, in a manner close to being monstrous, this happens not according to the laws of motion2 of its own eccentric, but to those of the earth’s orb, clearly foreign. ['eccentric']\n",
      "have most solidly demonstrated that there are no liberations in the inclination of the eccentric. ['inclination']\n",
      "For three ways of investigating the maximum inclination were proposed. ['inclination']\n",
      "In the first, the sun was near Mars’s sextiles and quintiles,3 that is, about as close to Mars’s conjunction as it could be and still allow Mars to be conveniently seen and observed. ['conjunction']\n",
      "But when the sun was at all three places, Mars exhibited one and the same maximum inclination (1° 50’, about), northwards, at the same place on its eccentric, and the same amount southwards at the opposite position. ['inclination']\n",
      "12, it appeared that when Mars was near the nodes of its motion on the eccentric, no matter what position the sun occupied on its orb (whether near Mars or far from it), Mars was never seen to have any latitude. ['nodes']\n",
      "And in the fifth part below it will be proved in many ways that the declination of Mars’s orbit from the ecliptic is constant at any particular position on its orbit. ['orbit']\n",
      "And so let us conclude with great certainty that the inclination of the planes of the eccentrics to the ecliptic does not vary at all. ['inclination']\n",
      "And a follower of Ptolemy may learn from this that the plane of the epicycle is always parallel to the plane of the ecliptic. ['epicycle']\n",
      "12 that when the center is near the nodes, the epicycle lies entirely on the ecliptic. ['nodes']\n",
      "Reduction of observed positions at either end of the night to the fine of the sun’s apparent motion1 ['observed']\n",
      "Now, with that investigation carried through to its conclusion, and the positions of the nodes, the inclination of the planes, and its constancy all demonstrated, all of which were necessary for the coming reduction, we shall now define the positions which a planet may occupy on its orbit when the sun itself is diametrically opposite it. ['nodes']\n",
      "Suppose, however, that on 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m Mars was observed at 8° 37’ Gemini,3 and the motion over five days was 1° 55’. ['observed']\n",
      "But the sun is 7° 51’ 24“ removed from opposition to Mars. ['opposition']\n",
      "Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m. ['opposition']\n",

      "From Lansberge, then, the tangent of the 20° side multiplied by the secant of the angle of inclination, 1° 50’, the last five digits being dropped,5 gives an increase of only 18½ of the smallest units, to which corresponds about 35 seconds. ['inclination']\n",
      "Mars therefore, standing opposite 6° 28’ Gemini, is 35“ further along on its orbit. ['orbit']\n",

      "But because Mars was elevated 37½° above the horizon, diurnal parallax comes into the reckoning, and subtracts some small quantity from the longitude, thus making it 26° 26’ Virgo, with a slightly greater latitude. ['diurnal']\n",
      "For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars’s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun’s. ['parallax']\n",

      "But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun’s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. ['parallax']\n",
      "Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64° from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5’ 24“. ['nonagesimal']\n",
      "For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1° 9’ 45“ north. ['latitude']\n",

      "That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. ['refraction']\n",
      "But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. ['refraction']\n",

      "Moreover, even if αζ is a little longer than αη which is nearer the perigee, this should be attributed to the smallness of the angles at ζ, through which such a small error as this could easily be introduced. ['perigee']\n",

      "With Θ, Η, Ε, and Ζ connected with Κ, it will be demonstrated as before, with exactly the same numbers, lines, and angles, that these lines are unequal, contrary to common opinion, and consequently that Mars does not traverse the circle ΓΔ, whose center is at the center of uniform motion Κ, but the circle ΖΗΕΘ instead, whose center lies in the direction of Β from Κ, very near to the line ΚΒ, which should be parallel to the line drawn from the earth Α through the sun's perigee. ['perigee']\n",
      "Therefore, the epicycle's apogee lies in the direction of the sun's perigee. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And because the epicycle, owing to the total equivalence just mentioned, is to be supposed equal to the sun's circuit, with ΖΚ parallel to ΧΑ, ΕΚ to ΟΑ, ΗΚ to ΙΑ, and ΘΚ to ΤΑ, it is also likely that ΧΑ, ΟΑ, ΙΑ, and ΤΑ are unequal, and that the point of the sun's mean position (the center of the sun's epicycle, in the Brahean conception) does not stand at the same distance from the point of uniform motion throughout its circuit. ['epicycle']\n",
      "In the Tychonic form, let A be the earth, and about it let the sun's concentric CD be described, and let this be considered to be the deferent of the system of the planets, since A is the point of uniform motion of the sun's concentric. ['deferent']\n",
      "Therefore the sun itself will be on another eccentric circle. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let its center be in the direction of B from A. Now let AL be the reference for Mars's line of apsides, so that the line of apsides, in the circling and translating of its eccentric, remains ever parallel to AL. ['apsides']\n",

      "times Mars is supposed to be at the same place on the eccentric, its distances from the points of the sun's mean position will all be equal and parallel. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This is because there is no difference between the two other than that Ptolemy has an epicycle, equal to the [circle of the] theory of the sun, carried around on an eccentric, while Tycho has the eccentric carried around on the [circle of the] theory of the sun or on a circle equal to the Ptolemaic epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And so that point on the eccentric whence originates the eccentricity of Mars and all the planets (which is here considered to be on the line of the sun's mean motion, following earlier practitioners) does not go around on that circle DC about whose center A it makes equal angles in equal times, but on the circle HTES whose center lies in the direction opposite the center of the sun's eccentric B, as has thus far become roughly clear from the lines themselves. ['eccentric']\n",
      "From three distances of the sun from the center of the world, with known zodiacal positions, to find the apogee and eccentricity of the sun or earth. ['apogee']\n",
      "I shall now once again test the quantity of the eccentricity and the position of the apogee in a single circle adapted to all three forms. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Tycho, however, places the sun's apogee at 5½° Cancer. ['apogee']\n",
      "But the whole solar eccentricity is 3592, and its half is 1796 or 1800. ['solar']\n",
      "So here somewhat less than half of the solar eccentricity is claimed for the eccentricity of our circle. ['solar']\n",
      "But you should bear in mind that observations near minimum values may be somewhat in error, and that use was made of a questionable mean longitude and equation from Tycho. ['longitude']\n",
      "Consequently, we shall look into this more carefully below, where in many instances, through a fine demonstration, the eccentricity will be found to be half the solar eccentricity, and the apogee very near the Tychonic one. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "It has thus been demonstrated in the Copernican form that the center of the earth's circuit is halfway between the sun's body and the point of uniform motion of that circuit. ['circuit']\n",
      "That is, that the earth proceeds nonuniformly on its orbit, slowing when it recedes far from the sun and speeding up when it approaches. ['orbit']\n",
      "In the same way it has been demonstrated in the Ptolemaic form that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point about which its motion is uniform, and that its eccentricity is half of the sun's eccentricity as it is commonly determined, and in the opposite direction. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Finally, in the Tychonic form it has been demonstrated that the point whence originate the planets' eccentricities does not move on the sun's concentric, but throughout its course is unequally distant from the earth, about which it moves regularly and uniformly; and that it is farther away near the sun's perigee, and nearer at apogee, again by half of the sun's eccentricity. ['perigee']\n",
      "And so, since this Ptolemaic epicycle and this Brahean deferent have so great an analogy with the theory of the sun, it is likely that they also have a greater analogy: that is, the sun's true eccentricity, too, will only be half of that computed from the maximum equation; or, what is the same thing, the sun will make use of an equant, whose eccentricity is twice the eccentric's eccentricity. ['epicycle']\n",
      "The argument consequently will become clearer when, moved by those reasons adduced in Chapter 6 above, I measure out the planet's motion by the sun's apparent motion. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "demonstration from the same observations that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point of attachment or axis, and that the annual orb (and so also the earth's path around the sun, or the sun's around the earth) is eccentric with respect to the body of the sun or earth, with an eccentricity just half that which Tycho Brahe found through equations of the sun's motion. ['epicycle']\n",
      "We shall now go through the observations1 again, carefully: On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m, Mars was found by careful observation and calculation to be at 24° 22' 56\" Aries with latitude 0° 3' 20\" S. At that time, 8° Aries was setting, so Mars was rather low. ['observation']\n",
      "Therefore, it was raised up towards the east by refraction, so it seems right that without refraction it would have been seen at 24° 20' Aries. ['east']\n",
      "Its parallax can only be very small, particularly at this distance, for Mars was near the sun and therefore had receded very far from the center of the earth. ['parallax']\n",
      "On 1592 January 23 at 7h 20m, using only one stellar distance from Mars, without the confirmation of another, Mars was found at 11° 32' 44\" Aries with latitude 0° 1' 36\" S. And so we shall make no changes for horizontal variations, although we suspect an uncertainty of one or two minutes. ['latitude']\n",
      "On 1593 December 7 at 8h 0m Mars was found at 3° 6' 50\" Aries with no danger of horizontal variation, with latitude 7’ 9\" S. However, the right ascension found using three stars showed a discrepancy of 4', and the value taken as true was the mean between the extremes. ['horizontal variation']\n",
      "On 1595 October 25 at 8h 10m, the planet's distance from three fixed stars was observed, and by unanimous consensus the planet was found to be at 19° 39' 25\" [Taurus] with latitude 0° 12' 41\" S. ['observed']\n",
      "Accordingly, to its sidereal position ['sidereal']\n",
      "In 1593 the motion over 1 hour 45 min., from the diurnal motion of 33', is 2' 25\". ['diurnal']\n",
      "Likewise, in 1595 the motion over 2 hours 25 min., from a diurnal motion of 22' 11\", is 2' 14\". ['diurnal']\n",
      "And let α be the center of the sun; β the center of Mars's eccentric, drawn through ο; χ the center of uniform motion for Mars's eccentric; γ the center of the earth's eccentric; δ, ε, ζ, η four positions of the earth, opposite the sun's apparent positions; θ the position of Mars on its eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "We shall now test the magnitude of the eccentricity that may be deduced from these distances. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "If the sun's theory lacks an equant, the eccentricity of its circle will turn out to be about 3600. ['equant']\n",
      "This is because we used the true or apparent positions of the sun, whose point of uniform motion has to be that far (namely, 3600) from the center of the world, as Brahe has proved from solar observations. ['solar']\n",
      "But if, on the other hand, the eccentricity turns out to be less, and is about half the Brahean value, we have won, and vindicated our contention, that the point of uniform motion found by Brahe is not the center of the sun's eccentric. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "You can see at a glance (I would note in passing) that αζ is the shortest, it being near the sun's perigee; next, that αε is longer, it being in Aquarius, 34 degrees from perigee; then αη, it being 54 degrees from perigee; and lastly, that αδ is longest, because it is 80 degrees from perigee. ['perigee']\n",
      "And since αζ is almost at perigee, it will be hardly any longer than the shortest. ['perigee']\n",
      "Similarly, since αδ is near the middle elongation, it will be only a little less than the mean distance. ['elongation']\n",
      "Therefore, the eccentricity will come out to be a little greater than 1038, which is the difference between δα and ζα. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And if δα is assigned the measure of 100,000, 1038 will have the value 1539; and this is about what the eccentricity will amount to (it is actually a little greater). ['eccentricity']\n",
      "The same is to be said of the sun's apogee. ['apogee']\n",
      "For because ζα is shortest, the perigee is about 25° 53' Sagittarius. ['perigee']\n",
      "And because εα is shorter than ηα, the perigee is closer to 10° 17' Aquarius than to 11° 42' Scorpio. ['perigee']\n",
      "Therefore, the perigee is beyond 25° 57' Sagittarius and before 10° 17' Aquarius; that is, in Capricorn. ['perigee']\n",
      "For now I shall follow the geometric path to investigate the position of the apogee and the eccentricity. ['apogee']\n",
      "Therefore, the ratio of δζ to the radius δγ, and to the eccentricity γα, will be given, together with the angle δαγ, because αγ lies in the direction of the apsides. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And yet it was said before that using δ and ζ the eccentricity comes out to be a little greater than 1539, supposing that ζ is nearest to perigee. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But since here (letting η be received into the company in place of ζ) the eccentricity comes out much greater, this hints, although erroneously, that there is some line at perigee which is still shorter than αζ. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "In order that this distance at perigee might be able to be shorter than αζ, this line of argument has moved the perigee to 16 Capricorn, that is, farther from αζ. ['perigee']\n",
      "But since we already know that the sun's perigee is not in 16 Capricorn but in 6 Capricorn, it is appropriate to assign the cause of the slight error to the point η and to the excessive length of the line αη ^5. ['perigee']\n",
      "For the result of this is that the circle δεη would be too large, and its radius δγ too long; and consequently γα would be too long, and γ would move perpendicularly away from the line δη, but obliquely from the point ζ. Thus, the line γα would now be placed too far to the east. ['east']\n",
      "6 For example, let the observed position of Mars be 19° 40' Taurus, and the supplement αηθ be 7° 58' 26\", and ηθα 5° 20' 8\": then αη will be 67,030. ['observed']\n",
      "Consequently the perigee is in 10° 36' Capricorn, and the eccentricity is still about 2100. ['perigee']\n",
      "Thus, as the true perigee was approached the eccentricity decreased, and so when we get exactly to the correct perigee we shall also get exactly to the halving of the eccentricity. ['perigee']\n",
      "But it is nonetheless worthwhile to find out, in addition, how much we gain by changing the line αθ, adding one minute to the computed eccentric position of Mars while keeping fixed the point of observation (that is, the point η) for the year 1595. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But since we are supposing that Mars is at the same eccentric position all four times, the length of αθ will also be the same for all four times. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Hence the angle δγα is 76° 37’ 30\", and the perigee is at 7° 23' Capricorn, with an eccentricity about 1880, which would clearly be 1800 if the perigee were brought back to 5½ Capricorn, as could happen through the combined effect of both causes. ['perigee']\n",
      "And there could easily be a one minute error in the equations of the eccentric found by the hypothesis of Chapter 16. ['eccentric']\n",
      "So, since the result is easily vitiated by the data from 1595, let us now omit them and use the remaining three points δ, ε, ζ, keeping the most recent correction of eccentric position, and forming the new triangles δαε and εαζ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "From this and γδ, δγα is found to be 75° 8' 40\" and the perigee in 8 51 45 Capricorn, about what it was before. ['perigee']\n",
      "The eccentricity, somewhat more than 2000, is to be decreased to 1800 (as before), if the perigee were to be moved back to 5½° Capricorn. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "For then, from the point θ set up by the other lines of observation, some line would be drawn outside θε towards θζ. ['observation']\n",
      "One might, however, hold suspect such license in making small changes in the data, thinking that by taking the same liberty in changing whatever we don't like in the observations, the full Tychonic eccentricity might also at last be obtained. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Finally, to avoid prolixity, if αθ be 147,700, and the eccentric position of Mars in 1595 be 14° 21' 7\" Taurus, and the eccentricity of the earth be 1800, and the earth's path oval, as will be said in Chapters 30 and 44, the appearances will come out to be ['eccentric']\n",
      "In the first, let the earth replace the solar body at α, and then lines of vision be drawn out from α parallel to δθ, εθ, ζθ, ηθ, so that the Copernican positions of the earth δ, ε, ζ, η  coalesce into one Ptolemaic position of the earth. ['solar']\n",
      "Meanwhile, let the star Mars, which for Copernicus had stayed at one point θ, now be placed about θ at four locations: ι, κ, λ, μ. The description of this circle is as follows. ['star']\n",
      "Thus the point θ, which we can call the point of attachment, moves around on the eccentric, which before, in Copernicus, the planet bodily traversed. ['eccentric']\n",
      "While the epicycle is thus being borne around, the center ν is driven around θ, so that at one time it is inside θα and at another it is outside; however, θν is always parallel to itself and to the line αγ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And the epicycle will be moved uniformly, not about θ to which it is attached, nor about its center ν, but about a higher point, ο, such that θο is twice θν. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For the earth too will thus be moved10 uniformly about π, not about the center of its orb γ, nor about the sun at α. ['orb']\n",
      "That these characteristics belong to the Ptolemaic epicycle, is properly demonstrated. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But that they are carried over from the epicycle to the theory of the sun is shown by a probable argument only, pieced together from Ptolemaic opinions. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For, keeping everything as it was, let ατ be set up equal to απ and in the same line but in the opposite direction, so that τα may be the center of the sun's uniform motion, which the theorists had thought to be the center of the sun's orbit. ['orbit']\n",
      "Therefore, the line θνο will always be parallel to the line of the sun's apogee ατ. ['apogee']\n",
      "Now, if you decide that the diurnal parallax of Mars should be kept in the same ratio to the sun's parallax as that given out by Tycho, ικλμ will also be equal to the [circle of the] sun's theory, and consequently θο will also be equal to the eccentricity of the point τ, about which the sun moves uniformly. ['diurnal']\n",
      "But ικλμ also moves in the same direction in which the sun moves on its circle, according to Ptolemy, and at the same times both the sun on its eccentric and the planet on its epicycle are found in the same, or at least corresponding, places, so that lines from τ through the sun and from ο through the planet are ever parallel, again as taught by Ptolemy. ['eccentric']\n",
      "So, since all other things are in agreement, why not this, too: that, just as ικλμ is moved uniformly, not about the center ν but about the point ο above it, as is demonstrated here by the transposition of the eccentric of the earth into the epicycle, where we took θ in place of α, ν for γ, and ο for π: so likewise, these points are distinct in the sun, so that the eccentricity ατ, which is found from solar observations, is to be bisected at ξ, with ξ the center of the sun's eccentric λρσυ? ['eccentric']\n",
      "For Ptolemy made use of such a procedure to make it appear that if the sun's apparent positions were used, exactly the same eccentricity would be used on the planet's epicycle as was found in the sun. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "So since the observations give evidence of the double eccentricity of the Ptolemaic epicycle (because, as was said, the parallel relationships of the lines leave the triangles the same as in the Copernican form), the spirit of Ptolemy urges us to bisect the sun's eccentricity as well, so that the lines λι, ρκ, σλ, υμ remain parallel. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "So by this reasoning even Ptolemy will be persuaded that ατ, the eccentricity of the sun's motion found by Tycho, should be bisected at ξ, so that the center of the sun's orbit is at ξ, and the uniformity of motion at τ. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "For anyone who believes Ptolemy, thinking that for the three superior planets there are three theories  of epicycles, exactly equal to the theory of the sun, in quantity and quality, in lines as well as motions, in absolutely all respects—this same person will not admit this one inconsistency, but will also gladly derive this bisection for the solar theory from the epicycle, as if from an image in a mirror to the face itself. ['solar']\n",
      "The Ptolemaic epicycle has three notable points: the center ν, the point θ which we have called the point of attachment, and the point ο about which its motion is uniform. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now since it is said that the line θο remains parallel to ατ throughout the entire circuit, what are the properties of the circuits described by the other two points ν and ο? ['circuit']\n",
      "In order to show this, let lines be drawn from ξ and τα parallel to αβ, and from β and χ parallel to ατ, and let them be extended so as to intersect one another; and let the intersection of the lines from ξ and β be φ, from ξ and χ be ψ, from τ and β be ς, and from τ and χ be ω. Now, just as the point θ is moved regularly around χ, traversing an eccentric described about β, so also ν is moved regularly around ψ, traversing an eccentric described about φ. Also, ο is moved regularly about ω, traversing a third eccentric likewise equal to the others, described about ς. For all three of these eccentrics the zodiacal position of the apogee is the same, owing to the lines' αχ, ξψ, τω being parallel. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But the word \"apogee\" cannot be applied properly to any of these, apart from the first, that belongs to the point θ, since its line of apsides αβχ is drawn through the earth itself, which was placed at α, but not at ξ or τ. ['apogee']\n",
      "It is indeed true that straight lines can be drawn from the earth α through the centers of the remaining two eccentrics φ and ς, which may properly be called \"lines of the apogee\". ['apogee']\n",
      "These will fall to the west of the apogee αχ; that is, αφ will be at 24° Leo, and ας at 19° Leo, approximately. ['west']\n",
      "But then these lines will not pass through the pertinent point of uniform motion of each eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus, if any of Ptolemy’s followers does not wish to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point θ, but prefers to relate it to the center ν, he will be driven to use two lines of apsides: one, αφ, for the eccentric, and the other, αψ, for the equant; and also two eccentricities, αφ and αψ. ['epicycle']\n",
      "The same will happen if anyone wishes to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point ο, about which the epicycle revolves uniformly. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For then the eccentric bearing  the point ο will have two apogees and eccentricities, one for the center on the line ας, and the other for the point of uniformity of motion on the line αω. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The remaining possibilities are either to attach the epicycle at θ, or improperly to take apogees for the eccentrics that bear the points ν and ο, and to compute the eccentricities from the points ξ and τ, not from the reference point, the earth α. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Let the Copernican positions of the earth δ, ε, ζ, η, merge, not in α, but in γ, so that in this diagram, γ, not α, denotes the earth, the center of the world. ['diagram']\n",
      "Here, the epicycle too, as well as its three eccentrics belonging to the points θ, ν, ο, will be shifted from their positions by the amount αγ, and a perfect equivalence will result. ['epicycle']\n",
      "The eccentric's point of attachment is set at the four different positions λ, ρ, σ, υ, so the planet is at ι, κ, λ, μ, and ιλ, καρ, λσ, μυ, and θα parallel. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now Tycho himself made the center of the circle of Mars carry the double epicycle, and said that it goes around a uniformly on a circle concentric with the sun: for this idea he was indebted to Ptolemy. ['epicycle']\n",
      "6 of Part I) to seek that point of attachment, whether it is the center of the concentric or of an eccentric, in the center of the solar body, this being supported by physical arguments and by the demonstration of its geometrical possibility. ['eccentric']\n",
      "22 and 23, that unless this were done, even if the observations were referred to the sun's mean position, the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Brahean deferent would be made eccentric, in directions exactly opposite to the sun's eccentricity. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But it has already been proved here in Chapter 26 that this center of Mars's concentric (or the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) is found, not on an equal eccentric described about the center of the sun's point of uniform motion τ, as Brahe along with the other authorities had believed, but on an eccentric described about ξ, which is in the middle position between α and τ.\n",
      "Therefore, if the center of Mars's concentric goes around with the sun, it nevertheless goes around on an eccentric described about ξ, and consequently the sun itself will go around on an eccentric described about ξ. But its motion is uniform about τ. Therefore, the sun's eccentricity ατ must be bisected at ξ. For it is not likely that, although the centers of the concentrics of Mars and the sun go around in the same way, reach apogee at the same time, transpose their apogees in the same way, go slowly or quickly in the same way, and describe the same circumferences, their circles would nevertheless make different digressions from the earth in the same direction. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "From four other observations of the star Mars outside the acronychal situation but still in the same eccentric position, to demonstrate the eccentricity of the earth's orb, with its aphelion and the ratio of the orbs at that place, together with the eccentric position of Mars on the zodiac.

      "Now in any of these triangles the angles at α are given by the position of the sun from Tycho, and the correction for the precession of the equinoxes. ['precession']\n",

      "Nevertheless, by extrapolating we realize that at this place Mars's eccentric position has to be moved back3 through 2½’, just as previously in Chapter 22 it was moved forward 1' on the opposite semicircle. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Both of these are brought about by an increase of the eccentricity and a slight retraction of the aphelion. ['eccentricity']\n",

      "Also, let γ be the center of motion or of uniformity, at which the earth (for Ptolemy, the center of the epicycle, for Tycho the sun and the point of attachment of all the eccentrics) sets out equal angles in equal times. ['epicycle']\n",

And let this also be posited at the start: that although the earth (sun, or planet) is moved uniformly around γ and thus nonuniformly around β, it nevertheless remains on the circumference of the circle described about β. Now, by the equivalence shown in the second chapter (which, for the sake of avoiding confusion, I shall not apply to the general Ptolemaic hypothesis), this is exactly as if one were to say that the earth (or sun) is moved nonuniformly on a concentric with an epicycle4 about center α, the semidiameter of the epicycle being equal to αβ; and the arcs described on the concentric by the center of the epicycle being similar to the arcs of the epicycle described by the earth (or sun), so that both the earth (or sun) and the center of the epicycle are moved unequally in equal times, so as to become slow, or again speed up, simultaneously.

      "It is true that in this way (that is, in associating the distance αζ of the angle  δαζ with an angle which is as much smaller than δαζ as δαζ is smaller than δβζ) a path is attached to the circuit of the earth (or sun) about α which is oval rather than exactly circular. ['circuit']\n",

      "And through the center of the world α, from which the eccentricity is reckoned (and in the business at hand, it is the sun for Copernicus and the earth for the others), let the straight line ψω be drawn, intersecting the eccentric at ψ and ω, so that the planet is at ψ and ω, having traversed the arcs of the eccentric δψ and εω, from apogee or aphelion and from perigee  or perihelion, respectively. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But since δψ and εω are taken as minimal arcs, as if at the apsides δ and ε, they do not differ perceptibly from straight lines. ['apsides']\n",
      "These arcs, which are in fact unequal, appear equal from α. The question now is, how much time will the planet take to traverse each arc, according to Ptolemy's theory and hypothesis, when it has an equant? ['equant']\n",
      "So let straight lines be drawn from the center γ through the points ψ and ω, intersecting the equant at χ, τ. Now Ptolemy will say, \"since the whole circle of the equant υφ denotes the periodic time of the planet, then υχ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric ψδ, and φτ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric εω.\" ['equant']\n",
      "Nevertheless, these numbers are of the order of the eccentricity of Mars, which according to Ptolemy has the greatest eccentricity of all the planets. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Therefore, the arcs δψ and εω being taken as equal (which hitherto were unequal), either δψ or εω will be a mean proportional between υχ, the increment of time at aphelion, and φτ, the increment of time at perihelion. ['aphelion']\n",
      "But since the ratio αδ to αε is also the duplicate of either of these (for it is compounded of the two, which are nearly equal, taking the arithmetic mean δβ or βε), therefore, the arcs on the eccentric δψ and εω being equal, the ratio of the times υχ to φτ will be equal to the ratio αδ to αε. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Or, more clearly, the planet takes a proportionally longer time to traverse some particular eccentric arc at δ than to traverse an equal eccentric arc at ε, according as αδ is greater than αε. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And this follows from the way the Ptolemaic form*  is ordered, and from its equalizing point, by means of a proof that is certain and valid so far as it concerns points near apogee and perigee. ['apogee']\n",
      "It was demonstrated in the previous chapter that the increments of time of a planet on equal parts of the eccentric circle (or on equal distances in the aethereal air) are in the same ratio to each other as the distances of those same spaces from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned; or, more simply, to the extent that a planet is farther from the point that is taken as the center of the world, it is less strongly urged to move about that point. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus, either that weakening will be the cause of the star's motion away from the center of the world, or the motion away will be the cause of the weakening, or both will  have some cause in common. ['star']\n",
      "Further, it is not in accord with nature that strength or weakness in longitudinal motion should be the cause of distance from the center. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "For distance from the center is prior both in thought and in nature to longitudinal motion. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "Indeed, longitudinal motion is never independent of distance from the center, since it requires a space in which to be performed, while distance from the center can be conceived without motion. ['longitudinal']\n",
      "I there supposed as one of the principles what has now been expressly and geometrically proved in Chapter 32: that a planet is  moved less vigorously when it recedes from the point whence the eccentricity is computed. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "If this is done, then at the same time we set up the eccentricity and the distances from the very center of the sun's body, with the result that the sun itself again comes to be at the center of the world (for Copernicus), or at least at the center of the planetary system (for Tycho). ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And so in the third place I have postponed, because of its conceptual difficulty, demonstrating from the observations that we cannot avoid referring Mars to the apparent position of the sun, and drawing the line of apsides, which bisects the eccentric, directly through the sun's body, unless perhaps we wish to allow an eccentric such as will by no means be in accord with the parallax of the annual orb. ['apsides']\n",
      "Now Tycho himself destroyed the notion of real orbs, and I in turn have in this Third Part irrefutably demonstrated that there is an equant in the theory of the sun or earth. ['equant']\n",
      "This seems gainsaid by the following: first, light is hindered by opaque things, and therefore if the moving power had light as a vehicle, rest of the moving bodies would follow upon darkness; again, light spreads spherically in straight lines, while the moving power, though spreading in straight lines, does so circularly; that is, it is exerted in but one region of the world, from east  to west, and not the opposite, not at the poles, and so on. ['east']\n",
      "In precisely the same manner, this moving power perpetually and without any interval of time is present from the sun wherever there is a suitable movable body, for it receives nothing from the movable body to cause it to be there. ['interval']\n",
      "In like manner, there is no slowing in the moving power to prevent the planet's having as much speed as it has itself, but the planet's speed is not therefore that great, since something intervening prevents that, namely, some sort of matter possessed by the surrounding aether, or the disposition of the movable body itself to rest (others might say, \"weight,\" but I do not entirely approve of that, except, indeed, where the earth is concerned). ['aether']\n",
      "This has been observed to some extent in catapults and all violent motions. ['observed']\n",
      "Therefore, it is not only required by the nature of the species, but likely in itself owing to this kinship with light, that along with the particles of its body or source it too is divided up, and when any particle of the solar body moves towards some part of the world, the particle of the immaterial species that from the beginning of creation corresponded to that particle of the body also always moves towards the same part. ['solar']\n",
      "Since the species is moved in a circular course, in order thereby to confer motion upon the planets, the body of the sun, or source, must move with it, not, of course, from space to space in the world—for I have said, with Copernicus, that the body of the sun remains in the center of the world—but upon its center or axis, both immobile, its parts moving from place to place, while the whole body remains in the same place. ['axis']\n",
      "Now imagine that some orator in a great crowd of people, encircling him in an orb,3 turns his face, or his whole body along with it, once around. ['orb']\n",
      "But when he turns himself around, he turns his eyes around to everyone in the orb. ['orb']\n",
      "Therefore, in a very short interval of time, all get a glimpse of his eyes. ['interval']\n",
      "Thus by turning his eyes around in the small space in which his head is located, he carries around along with it the rays of the spark of light in the very large  orb in which the eyes of the spectators all around are situated. ['rays']\n",
      "By the same argument, it appears to be a correct conclusion that there does not exist within the boundaries of the solar body anything immaterial by whose rotation the species descending from that immaterial something also rotates. ['solar']\n",
      "It therefore remains that the body of the sun itself rotates in the manner described above, indicating the poles of the zodiac by the  poles of its rotation (by a line extended from the center of the body to the fixed stars through the poles), and indicating the ecliptic by the greatest circle of its body, thus furnishing a natural cause for these astronomical entities. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Nevertheless, it follows from what has been said that every orb of power emanating from the sun (in the space embraced by the lowest, Mercury, as well as that embraced by the highest, Saturn) is twisted around with a whirl equal to that which spins the solar body, with an equal period. ['orb']\n",
      "For Saturn is less receptive than Jupiter, since its returns are slower, while the orb of power at the path of Saturn returns with the same swiftness as the orb of power at the path of Jupiter, and so on in order, all the way to Mercury, which, by example of the superior planets, doubtless will move more slowly than the power that pulls it. ['orb']\n",
      "This analogy shows that there is in all planets, even in the lowest, Mercury, a material force of disengaging itself somewhat from the orb of the sun’s power. ['orb']\n",
      "From this it is concluded that the rotation of the solar body anticipates  considerably the periodic times of all the planets; therefore, it must rotate in its space at least faster than once in a three-months’ span. ['solar']\n",
      "However, in my Mysterium Cosmographicum I pointed out that there is about the same ratio between the semidiameters of the sun’s body and the orb of Mercury as there is between the semidiameters of the body of the earth and the orb of the moon. ['orb']\n",
      "Hence, you may plausibly conclude that the period of the orb of Mercury would have the same ratio to the period of the body of the sun as the period of the orb of the moon has to the period of the body of the earth. ['orb']\n",
      "And the semidiameter of the orb of the moon is sixty times the semidiameter of the body of the earth, while the period of the orb of the moon (or the month) is a little less than thirty times the period of the body of the earth (or day), and thus the ratio of the distances is double the ratio of the periodic times. ['orb']\n",
      "Therefore, if the doubled ratio also holds for the sun and Mercury, since the diameter of the sun's body is about one sixtieth of the diameter of Mercury's orb, the time of rotation of the solar globe will be one thirtieth of 88 days, which is the period of Mercury's orb. ['orb']\n",
      "You may, on the other hand, prefer to prescribe the sun's diurnal period in such a way that the diurnal rotation of the earth is dispensed by the diurnal rotation of the sun, by some sort of magnetic force. ['diurnal']\n",
      "This opinion (on the rotation of the solar body as the cause of the motion for the other planets) is beautifully confirmed by the example of the earth and the moon. ['solar']\n",
      "Consider, therefore, how our earth occasions the motion of the moon: while this our earth, and its immaterial species along with it, rotates twenty nine and one half times about its axis, at the moon this emitted species can drive it around only once in the same time, in (of course) the same direction in which the earth leads it. ['axis']\n",
      "For if equal spaces were measured out in equal times, the moon ought to return in sixty days, since the size of its orb is sixty times the size of the earth's globe. ['orb']\n",
      "Thus, to remove your bewilderment, consider that on the principles we have supposed it would necessarily follow that if the moon were not to resist, by its material force, the motion impressed from outside by the earth, the moon would be carried at exactly the same speed as the earth's immaterial species, that is, with the earth itself, and  would complete its circuit in 24 hours, in which the earth also completes its circuit. ['circuit']\n",
      "And the power of attracting iron is spread out in an orb from the magnet so  that there exists a certain orb within which iron is attracted, but more strongly so as the iron comes nearer into the embrace of that orb. ['orb']\n",
      "In exactly the same way the power moving the planets is propagated from the sun in an orb, and is weaker in the more remote parts of the orb. ['orb']\n",
      "Therefore, as the sun forever turns itself, the motive force or the outflowing of the species from the sun’s magnetic fibers, diffused through all the distances of the planets, also rotates in an orb, and does so in the same time as the sun, just as when a magnet is moved about, the magnetic power is also moved, and the iron along with it, following the magnetic force. ['orb']\n",
      "I know that the earth’s filaments and its motion indicate the equator, while  the circuit of the moon is generally related to the zodiac – on this point there will be more in Chapter 37 and Part 5. ['circuit']\n",
      "And just as the planets are eccentric with respect to the sun, so is the moon with respect to the earth. ['eccentric']\n",
      "So it is certain that the earth is looked upon by the moon’s mover as a kind of pole star (so to speak), just as the sun is looked upon by the movers belonging to the rest of the planets, for which see Chapter 38. ['star']\n",
      "It might appear that in order to avoid this as much as possible, God introduced the relative inclinations of all the eccentrics, deviations from the ecliptic, and transpositions of the nodes, as well as the proportions of the bodies and the attenuation of shadows in a cone. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "And since it would not be possible completely to prevent the stars' occasionally lining up with the sun, it is tempting  to suppose that the very slow motions of the apsides and nodes (which are, as it were, a kind of aberration of the epicycles from their periodic times) derive their origin thence. ['apsides']\n",
      "On this account I would nearly separate light from moving power, unless I were to come upon examples in nature which leave to the rays of light, even when impeded, a certain efficacy in those locations where their entry is prohibited. ['rays']\n",
      "Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there. ['interposition']\n",
      "Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate. ['interposition']\n",
      "And although it is impeded by the interposition of the iron plate, this too belongs to the magnetic nature, and it immediately drinks up the magnet's power and uses it as if it were its own. ['interposition']\n",
      "In respect to the likelihood of the cause of the apogees' motion, it proves  nothing concerning this common solar power being impeded by occultation ^2. ['solar']\n",
      "Further, if the motion of the apogees were to arise because the motion of the planets around the sun is impeded by the occultation of the motive species emanating from the sun, the motion in longitude would be slowed, either by a progressive motion of latitude (by which the apogees would move back) or equally by slowing of the latitudinal motion. ['longitude']\n",
      "It will therefore spread out its rays to every orb, and from a demonstration in optics, as the amplitude of the greater spherical surface γ, considered as an imaginary terminus for those rays, is to the amplitude of the smaller, β, so will the density of light at the smaller orb β be to its density at the greater γ. ['rays']\n",
      "Thus its individual points, of which there are an infinity, spread out rays to the individual hemispheres β and γ in the same ratio. ['rays']\n",
      "For it seems that the brightness of the rays ought to be intensified because of the fact that bodies appear to be magnified when they approach, as [for example] Venus, when at the perigee of the epicycle, defines a more evident shadow around bodies than at apogee. ['rays']\n",
      "For, as concerns the point, since it has no magnitude, while the rays are amplified with the magnitudes of bodies, it follows that the radiation of a point in itself is nothing, and hence what has no radiation has no greater or lesser density. ['rays']\n",
      "Second, it is supposed that the optical magnification of the diameter or of the disc adds to the strength of the rays, although this is but a deception of the visual faculty, and belongs to the genus of theoretical entities, which lack any efficacy. ['rays']\n",
      "The physical identity of the circle δε, the surface δαε (when light is in question) and the body δε (when power is in question) remains the same whether it is viewed from γ or from β, and will always act the same and have the same effect, spreading the same amount of power or light in the more diffuse orb γ as in the more compact orb β. Nothing is lost in the journey: the entire species carries through to any distance, however remote. ['orb']\n",
      "Thus, the magnetic filaments of the sun were supposed, above, to be set up only in longitude, not towards the poles or in other directions. ['longitude']\n",
      "For in light, the  rays do not flow out solely from the individual points and circles of the body to the corresponding points and circles of the sphere. ['rays']\n",
      "Thus, the rays from γ do not come only from α (by which arrangement it would be impossible to ascribe a density to light in the spheres, since it would have no quantity in its origin, descending as it does from a point). ['rays']\n",
      "Instead, the rays flow out from the whole hemisphere of the lucid body to the individual points of the imaginary spherical surface: thus, the rays from both δ and ε flow out to γ. The same thing takes place likewise with power. ['rays']\n",
      "Even though the magnetic filaments of the solar body are ordered according to zodiacal longitude, and even though there is but a single great circle of the sun's body beneath the zodiac or ecliptic, and roughly beneath the orbit of the planet, and (finally) even though the other smaller circles (which are compacted to the size of points beneath the poles) are subordinated to their corresponding circles in the sphere of the planet, nevertheless, the rays from all the filaments of the solar body (standing up from one hemisphere of the body) flow down and converge on the individual points of the path of any of the planets as well as on those poles that are above the poles of the sun's body, and the body of the planet is transported according to the measure of the density of this entire species compounded of all the filaments. ['solar']\n",
      "The planet will not go to the poles (even though there might be some of the species from the sun's body at those points) because the filaments of the solar body are not extended in the direction of the poles, nor does the sun rotate in that direction, but rather in the direction in which its filaments urge it. ['solar']\n",
      "On these suppositions, it is so far from being the case that the planets are carried towards the poles that there is instead a single region of the zodiac, the mean between the poles, through which all planets of necessity would move in longitude without deflection, if they were to cease their own proper motions (of which see Chapter 38 below). ['longitude']\n",
      "For the species of the solar hemisphere which takes up a post at some point of the zodiac, such as the point ζ in the present diagram, is the total of the filaments of the semicircle all tending in the same direction in concert, as, from [the region from] θ through κ, from λ through μ, etc ^2. ['solar']\n",
      "After long and painstaking observations of the moon in every position in relation to the sun, Tycho Brahe expressed the opinion that in the moon, besides the anomaly of the epicycle, and besides that monthly anomaly which was also known to Ptolemy, the mean motion itself (so named in relation to these two inequalities) is not yet quite \"mean.\" ['epicycle']\n",

      "The question is, by what cause is the moon made to move more swiftly about T at C, O than at F, L, since we have just now mentally removed the eccentricity and the epicycles. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "For it should be noted that the moon, from point C on its orb, is borne less in the leftward direction L than the earth is borne to the right on its orb. ['orb']\n",
      "For if the power coming from the same source T is stronger at C, O than at F, L, then if the apogee is near C, O, there is a greater loss of speed than if the apogee were at F, L. Thus when going from the apogee at O or C the equations at F, L are greater than when going from the apogee at F, L to the conjunctions and oppositions O, C. ['apogee']\n",
      "This is demonstrated chiefly by the moon's making its circuit beneath the zodiac, like the annual circuit of the centre of the earth, although the earth's diurnal motion, which confers the monthly motion upon the moon, takes place beneath the equator. ['circuit']\n",
      "I have spoken of the origin of the motion which rotates the planets around the sun or the moon around the earth; that is, I have spoken of the natural causes of the circle which in the theories of the planets is called either eccentric or concentric, according to the various intentions of the authors. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now, some thing must be said of the natural cause of the eccentricity, or in the particular hypothesis of Copernicus, of the epicycle on a concentric. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Its innate quality is such that if a planet were to remain at the same distance from the sun it would be carried around perfectly uniformly, and would not experience any intension or remission of the solar motion. ['solar']\n",
      "Examples of natural things, and this hitherto disparaged kinship of  celestial things for terrestrial ones, cry out that in a simple body the operations which are more general are simpler, while the variables, if any (such as, in the motion of the planets, the varying distance from the sun, or the eccentricity), arise from the concurrence of extrinsic causes. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "In very much the same manner, the power moving out from the sun into the world through the species is a kind of rapid torrent, which sweeps along all the planets, as well as, perhaps, the entire aethereal air, from west to east. ['west']\n",
      "It is therefore necessary that the planets themselves, rather like the skiffs, have their own motive powers, as if they had riders [vectores] or ferrymen, by whose forethought they  accomplish not only the approach to the sun and recession from the sun, but also (and this might be called the second argument) the declinations of latitudes; and as if from one bank to the other (that is, from north to south and back), travel across this river (which itself only follows the course of the ecliptic) from north to south and back.

      "Let the eccentric be divided into any number of equal parts, beginning from the line of apsides at C, and let the ends of these parts be connected with A. Therefore, CA, DA, EA, FA, GA, HA, will be the distances of the end points of the equal parts from the source of power. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now with center β, radius βγ, equal to AB, let the epicycle γδ be described, divided into as many equal parts as the eccentric, beginning from γ, and let the line γβ be extended so as to make βα equal to BC, and let the point α be connected with the end points of the equal parts of the epicycle, by the lines γα, δα, εα, ζα, ηα, θα. ['epicycle']\n",
      "These lines will be respectively equal to the distances drawn to the eccentric from A, this having been demonstrated above in Chapter 2. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Next, with center α and radius δα, let the arc διθ be described, intersecting the diameter γζ at ι and about the same center α, with radius αε, let the arc ελη be described, intersecting the diameter γζ at λ, and let the end points of the parts equidistant from the aphelion of the epicycle γ be connected by the lines δθ, εη, which will intersect the diameter at κ, μ, so that αδ or αι is longer than ακ, and αε or αλ longer than αμ. ['aphelion']\n",
      "If it were possible for the planet to move on a perfect epicycle by its inherent force,1 and for its orbit at the same time to be a perfect circle, then we would have to consider similar arcs to be swept out in the same times, on the eccentric and on the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For let AN be drawn parallel to BD, and let AN be equal to BD, and about center N let an epicycle be described which shall go through D. Now since CD is a perfect circle, the same angles are swept out by the planet D about the center of the eccentric B as by the center of the epicycle N about the center of the sun A (through the equivalence demonstrated in Chapter 2), as long as the diameter of the epicycle ND with the planet at D always remains parallel to AB with respect to its position in the world. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Therefore, the speed of the center of the epicycle N about the sun A would be made the same as the speed of the planet D about the center of the eccentric B, so that those motions would be intensified at the same time and remitted at the same time. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And since intension and remission depends upon greater or less distance of the body  of the planet from the sun, therefore the center of the epicycle, remaining at the same distance, would be contrived to move slowly or swiftly on account of the planet's being farther from or nearer to the sun. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And although the power driving the planets is faster than any of them, as is shown in Chapter 34, we are here to suppose in our imagination a single ray of power AN  coming from the sun, as if there were a line upon which the center of the epicycle N would always remain. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now all this would be conceived more simply were we to consider the  diameter of the epicycle ND as always remaining parallel to itself. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For then the planet would carry out its motion by a mental image, not of the epicycle, but of the center of the eccentric B, and by keeping itself always at the same distance from that center. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now you might say that the planet observes the sun A, and already knows beforehand, through memory, which ordered distances from the sun a perfect eccentric would have to attain. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But that intermediate can be nothing but the position of the center of the eccentric B at a certain distance from the sun, which, as has just now been said, cannot be known by an unassisted mind. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Besides, if the planet were to derive its correct distances from the sun,  ordained by the rule of the circle, from memory, it could also derive from memory the equal arcs of the eccentric which are to be traversed in unequal times, and which are to be traversed by an extrinsic force originating in the sun, as if it were obtaining the values right from the Prutenic or Alphonsine tables. ['eccentric']\n",
      "It is consequently more fitting that the planet itself require no assistance, whether of epicycle or eccentric, but rather that the task which it either performs by itself or has a part in performing is a reciprocating path along the diameter γζ directed towards the sun α. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now to us the measure is clear from geometry and the diagram. ['diagram']\n",
      "For whenever the solar power moves the planet forward to the line DA, we then find the angle CBD and make γβδ equal to it; and thus we say that αδ, or αι which is its equal, is the correct distance from A to the planet at D. But this measure which we have proposed for humans, we have just now denied the planet when we removed it from the circumference of the epicycle and restricted it to the straits of the diameter γζ. ['solar']\n",
      "Consequently, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, then to equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, correspond unequal descents of the planet along the diameter, namely, γι, ιλ, λζ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For the time or duration of the planet on equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, is continuously diminished from the highest to the lowest points, and the angles at the sun are continuously increased, but the reciprocations γι are increased in the middle regions, such as ιλ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, the measure of the planet's descent on the diameter γζ is neither time, nor distance traversed on the eccentric, nor the angle at the sun. ['eccentric']\n",
      "What, then, if we should say this: although the motion of the planet does  not take place on an epicycle, this reciprocation is measured out in such a way that distances from the sun are produced that are similar to those which exist in an epicycle actually traversed? ['epicycle']\n",
      "First, this attributes to the power belonging to the planet a knowledge of the imaginary epicycle and of its effects in setting out distances from the sun; and further, it attributes knowledge of the future speed or slowness which the common motion from the sun is going to cause. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For it is necessary to suppose here an imaginary intension and remission of motion on the imaginary epicycle that is the same as that of the motion on the real eccentric. ['epicycle']\n",
      "This is more incredible than the previous accounts, where the motion of the body was combined with knowledge of the epicycle or eccentric. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Now anyone who is so attracted to the supposition of a perfectly circular  orbit as to locate in the planet a mind which could preside over the reciprocation, can say only this: that this planetary mind observes the increasing and decreasing size of the solar diameter, and understands, using this as an indication, what distances from the sun it should cause to occur at any given time. ['orbit']\n",
      "Instead, they find this either from the amount of time they have sailed, if wind and sea remain constant and the ship does not stop, or from the direction of the wind and the changing elevation of the pole, or from all or several of these in conjunction, or, may it please the gods, by a contrivance of a number of wheels, with paddles lowered into the water (for certain conceited mechanics are proposing an instrument of this sort, who ascribe the calm of the continents to the waves of the Ocean) ^2. ['conjunction']\n",
      "If it were indeed certain that this proper motion of the planet along the diameter of the epicycle could not be carried out by any material and corporeal or magnetic power of the planet, nor by an unassisted animate power, but that  it is governed by a planetary mind, nothing absurd would be stated ^5. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For that the sun is observed by the planets in other respects as well, the latitudes bear witness. ['observed']\n",
      "For by these latitudes the planets would depart from the middle and royal road of this solar power, as from the mainstream of a river, and move to the sides, as is said in Chapter 38, unless they meanwhile paid attention to the sun, and carried out their approach and recession along a line drawn to its center. ['solar']\n",
      "But all planets describe great circles that intersect the ecliptic at points that are opposite with respect to the sun, as was demonstrated for Mars from observations  above in Chapters 12, 13, and 14. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "However, in Part 5 below I will also transfer this characteristic of the latitude from the elements of mind to the elements of nature and magnetic faculties. ['latitude']\n",
      "Now one cannot say in reply to me that the solar diameter and its variation is far too small to be used as a standard. ['solar']\n",
      "I have observed those things in all cases whatever that have occurred to this very day. ['observed']\n",
      "So our hypothetical person who says that the planet's path is a perfect circle will say this: that the planet performs its reciprocation so as to make the diameters of the sun, at the end points of equal arcs of the eccentric, appear very nearly*  inversely proportional to the lines δα, εα, ζα, or to ια, λα, ζα, which are equal to them, taken with respect to the longest line γα; and that through this consideration of the diameters of the sun at the chosen moments of time, come the proximities of ι, λ, ζ to γ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "It should be known, however, that the increases of the diameter of the sun and the arcs of the epicycle do not square with each other well, and so the motive mind will have to have a very good memory in order to adjust the unequal versed sines of the arcs on the epicycle to the equal increases of the solar diameter. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For the same force that attracts the planet also repels it in turn, and this is inconsistent with the simplicity of the solar body. ['solar']\n",
      "You see, my thoughtful and intelligent reader, that the opinion of a perfect eccentric circle for the path of a planet drags many incredible things into physical theories. ['eccentric']\n",
      "This is not, indeed, because it makes the solar diameter an indicator for the planetary mind, for this opinion will perhaps turn out to be closest to the truth, but because it ascribes incredible faculties to the mover, both mental and animate. ['solar']\n",
      "An imperfect method for computing the equations from the physical hypothesis, which nonetheless suffices for the theory of the sun or earth. ['physical hypothesis']\n",
      "Now we must return to the equations of the sun's eccentric in particular, which is the main subject of this third part, and for the sake of which the general discussion of the last eight chapters has been presented. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Accordingly, let the path of the planet be a perfect eccentric, for in the theory of the sun the amount by which it differs from the oval path is imperceptible. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Since, therefore, the time increments of a planet over equal parts of the eccentric are to one another as the distances of those parts, and since the individual points of the entire semicircle of the eccentric are all at different distances, it was no easy task I set myself when I sought to find how the sums of the individual distances may be obtained. ['eccentric']\n",
      "I consequently began by dividing the eccentric into 360 parts, as if these were least particles, and supposed that within one such part the distance does not change. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Next, I assigned an artificial round number to the periodic time; although it is in fact 365 days and 6 hours, I set it equal to 360 degrees, or a full circle, which for the astronomers is the mean anomaly. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Finally, I added the times over the individual degrees and compared these times, or degrees of mean anomaly,  with the degrees of the eccentric anomaly, or the number of parts whose distance was sought. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "And since I knew that the points of the eccentric are infinite, and their distances are infinite, it struck me that all these distances are contained in the plane of the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Accordingly, instead of dividing the circumference, as before, I now cut the plane of the eccentric into 360 parts by lines drawn from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let AB be the line of apsides, A the sun (or earth, for Ptolemy); B the center of the eccentric CD, whose semicircle CD shall be divided into any number of equal parts CG, GH, HE, EI, IK, KD, and let the points A and B be connected with the points of division. ['apsides']\n",
      "And since triangles under equal altitudes are as their bases, and the sectors, or triangles, CBG, GBH, and so on (standing upon least parts of the circumference and therefore not differing from straight lines) all have the same altitude, the equal sides BC, BG, BH, they are therefore all equal. ['altitude']\n",
      "Therefore, no error is introduced if the areas be taken for the arcs in this way, and substituting the areas CGB, CHB for the angles of eccentric anomaly CBG, CBH. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus the area CGA becomes a measure of the time or mean anomaly corresponding to the arc of the eccentric CG, since the mean anomaly measures the time ^1. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Earlier, however, the part CGB of this area CAG was the measure of the eccentric anomaly, whose optical equation is the angle BGA. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, the remaining area, that of the triangle BGA, is the excess (for this place) of the mean anomaly over the eccentric anomaly, and the angle BGA of that triangle is the excess of the eccentric anomaly CBG over the equated anomaly CAG. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Thus the knowledge of this one triangle provides both parts of the equation corresponding to the equated anomaly GAC. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "Now clearly the genuine measure of the physical part of the equation AGB exceeds the proposed measure of the optical part OGB by the small space or area OAB (while near the perigee the latter in turn exceeds the former by a small area). ['perigee']\n",
      "Nevertheless, if the eccentricity is small, as is that of the sun or earth, with which we are concerned in this third part, this is not perceptible. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "For the nearer it approaches to the line of apsides, the narrower becomes the whole triangle AGB and consequently also its little part AOB, however much its altitude AO increases at the same time. ['apsides']\n",
      "Therefore, the greatest difference that can occur is that accumulated at the octants, or locations intermediate between the apsides and the quadrants. ['apsides']\n",
      "Since for some time now I have used the same form of computation by means of areas in the theory of Mars, I could not ignore this difference on account of the planet's great eccentricity, nor did the doubling of the optical equation avoid all perceptible error. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But GM is the altitude of triangle AGB, and NP is the altitude of triangle ANB. ['altitude']\n",
      "Therefore, as GM is to HL, altitude to altitude, so is area GAB to area HAB. ['altitude']\n",
      "Now let BE be perpendicular to CD, and let the triangle BEA have a right angle at B. BE will be the altitude, and BA the base. ['altitude']\n",
      "Therefore, by Euclid I.42, 900, or half the base BA (which for the sun is 1800), multiplied by the altitude BE, 100,000, which is the radius of the circle, gives the area of the triangle BEA, that is, 90,000,000. ['altitude']\n",
      "And as this the area of the circle is to the 360° of mean anomaly or time (that is, 21,600' or 1,296,000\"), so is the area of the triangle, 90,000,000, to 3713\"; that is, 1° 1' 53\". ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "At other degrees of eccentric anomaly, we proceed as follows. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Since BEA is 3713\", as its altitude EB is to HL or GM, the altitudes of the other triangles —that is, as the whole sine is to the sines of the eccentric anomaly HBC, GBC—so is 3713\" to the areas of the remaining triangles. ['altitude']\n",
      "And this is that fourth procedure for computing the eccentric equations, of which I began to speak above near the end of Chapter 34, which closely expresses the very nature of things and the foregoing theories of Chapters 32 and 33. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But the area of the circle contains the sum of all lines EF, and therefore it contains a sum which is less than all the lines EA, AF, since any two opposite points on the eccentric, together with A, determine such a triangle, with the exception of C, D, A, where instead of a triangle there is a straight line. ['eccentric']\n",
      "First,  it supposes that the orbit of the planet is a perfect circle, which, as will be demonstrated below in Ch. ['orbit']\n",
      "But EA is longer than EB, so that, if CA, GQ, HR, EB, IS, KL, DA, be taken, equal to lines determined by perpendiculars drawn from A to the lines between the points and B (as, in the circular diagram, the perpendicular AR is dropped to HB extended, defining HR which is shorter than HA), the figure between the conchoid AQRBSLA and CD would be quite equal to the figure CBBD. ['diagram']\n",
      "For in the circular diagram let HBR be extended to V, so that AH, AV correspond respectively to the upper angle HBE and the lower angle FBV, which are equal and are equally removed from the middle points E and F. And about center A with radius AV let the arc XY be drawn through AH and BH. ['diagram']\n",
      "Nevertheless, I wished to given them a preliminary treatment here, so that when all the planetary inequalities are determined (as, in particular, we presupposed that the course of the sun or earth is a perfect eccentric, which will be denied concerning Mars below in Ch. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For, touching the theory of the sun, with which we have been concerned to this point, we introduce no discrepancy either by misjudging the area of the conchoid, which we have taken to be less than it really is, or the assumption of a perfect eccentric, in which we appear to be erring in excess—to what extent cannot yet be said, since all has not been presented. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But the very things which have been rejected in this chapter as paralogisms will be taken up again below, when we shall have come to a perfectly correct way of expressing the equations, when the thing that gave rise to the paralogism will have been eliminated from that hypothesis. ['rise']\n",
      "I have described within a hair's breadth, through most certain observations and proofs, the cause and measure of the second inequality, which makes the planets appear stationary, direct, and retrograde. ['retrograde']\n",
      "It has been shown that this second inequality itself shares something in common with the first inequality, and that the theory of the sun or earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle (for Ptolemy) is like the theory of the other planets. ['epicycle']\n",
      "A trial examination of the apsides and eccentricity, and of the ratio of the orbs, using the observations recently employed, made at locations other than opposition with the sun, with, however, a false assumption. ['apsides']\n",
      "In the second part, above, I tried to find the aphelion and eccentricity, as well as the distances of the star Mars from the sun on the entire circle, using acronychal observations in imitation of the ancients. ['aphelion']\n",
      "And indeed, the eccentric equations corresponded closely to other observations made elsewhere than at opposition with the sun. ['eccentric']\n",
      "However, the eccentricity and the distances from the sun were first repudiated by the annual parallaxes of longitude and latitude. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Therefore, in order that the distances of the star from the center of the sun could be found throughout the circumference of the eccentric, the second inequality (epicyclic, for Ptolemy, or belonging to the annual orb for Tycho and Copernicus) had to be explored first, in Part 3. ['star']\n",
      "But now, if the planet's path were a perfect circle, the planet's first inequality, which exists by reason of the eccentric, could be investigated immediately. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For in Chapter 25 above we presented a method by which, given the distances of three points of the circumference from some point within the circumference, and the angles at that point, to find the position and size of the circle with respect to that point, the center and eccentricity, along with the apsides. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Now, in Chapter 26, the distance of Mars from the center of the sun was found to be 147,750 in 14° 21' 7\" Taurus, at the node, on 1595 October 25. ['node']\n",
      "And because Mars is 41 degrees from the node, multiplying the sine of 41° by the sine of the greatest inclination, found in Ch. ['node']\n",
      "13, yields an inclination at that point of 1° 12' 40\". ['inclination']\n",
      "But the secant of this inclination divided into the secant of 41° gives the secant of an arc 50\" longer. ['inclination']\n",
      "Thirdly, in Chapter 28 the distance of Mars was found to be 166,180 at 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, on 1590 October 31, 68 degrees from the node. ['node']\n",
      "So the inclination at that place is 1° 42' 40\". ['inclination']\n",

      "These three positions, referred to the same year, 1590, and the month of October, through corrections for the precession of the equinoxes, are: 1 ['precession']\n",
      "It is clear that the aphelion is nearer to the eighth degree of Virgo than to the others, because its distance is longer. ['aphelion']\n",
      "So, following [the pattern of] the demonstration in Chapter 25, let α be the center of the solar body. ['solar']\n",

      "For you perceive that three eccentric positions of Mars and the same number of distances from the sun, when the law of the circle is applied to them, reject the aphelion found above (with little uncertainty). ['eccentric']\n",

      "Therefore, since to increase the path by 11' 49\", one day, or the promotion of the planet to 26’ 13\" beyond aphelion, is needed, how much will the planet be promoted from aphelion to increase the path by 20’ 36\"? ['aphelion']\n",

      "Now when the true configuration of the orbits is found, the eccentric equations, upon which alone the vicarious hypothesis found in Chapter 16 has hitherto depended, must necessarily follow by the same means. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, following what was demonstrated in Chapter 40 (all of which, in every detail, is to be understood as holding here), let the orbit of the planet, in accord with the well-worn opinion, be circular, even though Ch. ['orbit']\n",
      "Therefore, at the eccentric anomaly of 90° the eccentricity 9264 found in Ch. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And since at the eccentric anomaly of 90° the area of the triangle is right-angled, the radius multiplied by half the eccentricity, 4632, gives the area of the triangle, 463,200,000. ['eccentric']\n",

      "But according to the method of Chapter 18, the vicarious hypothesis, accurate enough for the longitudes, shows us that to the mean anomaly of 95° 18' 28\" there ought to correspond the equated anomaly of 84° 42' 2\". ['longitudes']\n",

      "Indeed, in Chapter 19 as well, when I tried out the bisection on Mars and computed the equations using a motionless point of the equant in the Ptolemaic manner, a difference was found at about 45° of eccentric anomaly of nearly the same amount, but in the opposite direction. ['equant']\n",
      "For in the upper quadrant, the planet was closer to the aphelion, and in the lower to the perihelion, than it should have been; while here in the upper quadrant it was farther from the aphelion, and in the lower from the perihelion, than it should be. ['aphelion']\n",
      "And so in the upper quadrant it is moving too swiftly away from the aphelion, and the same from the perihelion below. ['aphelion']\n",
      "The same can be raised in objection to anyone who might conceive a suspicion that the error arose because we rejected the double epicycle of Copernicus and Tycho, which makes the orbit of the planet oval, and took up the Ptolemaic perfect circle in the present account. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For it was said at the end of Chapter 4 that the Copernican orbit moves outwards from the center by 246 parts, which would only increase the error, rather than making an incursion towards the center, as would suit our purposes, since we are now following the idea that the time increments are proportional to the distances.

      "Could this actually be the situation described in Chapter 6 above, in which by transposition of the reference point from the sun's mean motion to its apparent motion I set up another eccentric that makes an excursion towards the side of the sun's apogee? ['apparent motion']\n",
      "Here, however, you see that the planet approaches the center from the circular orbit on both sides. ['orbit']\n",
      "Clearly, then, [what is to be said] is this: the orbit of the planet is not a circle, but comes in gradually on both sides and returns again to the circle's distance at perigee. ['orbit']\n",
      "There it was  supposed that the area of a perfect eccentric is very closely equivalent to all the distances of the equal parts of the circumference of that eccentric from the source of the motive power, however many they are. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Thus, the parts of the area measure the amounts of time which the planet spends on the parts of the corresponding eccentric circumference. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But if that area about which the planet marks a boundary is not a perfect circle, but is diminished at the sides from the amplitude it has at the apsides, and if nevertheless this area circumscribed by an irregular orbit still measures the times which the planet takes to traverse the whole and its equal parts, then this diminished area measures a time equal to that measured by the previous undiminished area. ['apsides']\n",
      "So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there. ['aphelion']\n",
      "So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4. ['aphelion']\n",
      "And indeed, if contraries remedy one another, this is plainly the aptest medicine for purging the faults under which, in Chapter 43 above, our physical hypothesis was perceived to be laboring. ['physical hypothesis']\n",
      "For the planet is going to be swifter at the middle elongations, where previously it was perceived to be going slower than it should, and it will be slowed down above and below, near the apsides, where previously it did violence to the equations belonging to the eighths of the period through its excessive fleetness. ['apsides']\n",
      "This, then, is the other argument by which it is proved that the orbit of the planet really is deflected from the established circle, making ingress towards the sides and the centre of the eccentric. ['orbit']\n",
      "But for all that, this argument still did not have enough effect upon me to let me go beyond it and think about the planet's departure from the orbit. ['orbit']\n",
      "When I had sweated for the longest time trying to reconcile equations of this sort, I was finally discouraged by the absurdity of the measurements, and abandoned the whole enquiry until I was informed by the distances (found in the way shown in Chapter 41) about the departure from the [circular] orbit, and once more took up this problem of the equations. ['orbit']\n",
      "And from this, what I promised I would prove, in Chapters 20 and 23 above, is now done: that the orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape. ['orbit']\n",
      "When I was first informed in this manner by Brahe's most certain  observations that the orbit of the planet is not exactly circular but is deficient at the sides, I judged that I also knew the natural cause of the deflection from its footprints. ['orbit']\n",
      "For in that chapter I assigned the cause of the eccentricity to a certain power that is in the body of the planet. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "It therefore followed that the cause of this deflecting from the eccentric circle should also be ascribed to the same body of the planet. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For in Chapter 39,1 worked very energetically on the question of why I could not state a probable enough cause for a perfect circle's resulting from the orbit of the planet, as some absurdities always had to be attributed to the power that has its seat in the planet's body. ['orbit']\n",
      "Now, having seen from the observations that the planet's orbit is not perfectly circular, I immediately succumbed to this great persuasive impetus, believing that from those things which were called absurd in fabricating the circle in Chapter 39, now transmuted into a more probable form, an orbit of the planet that would be both correct and in agreement with the observations would be effected. ['orbit']\n",
      "Let the diagram from Chapter 39 be repeated. ['diagram']\n",
      "The weaker opinion in that chapter was that, in order to describe a perfect circle, the planet effects an epicycle by its inherent force, thus disengaging its body from the ray of power from the sun. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For in this fashion the line ND through the center  of the epicycle and the planet remains ever parallel to the line AB. ['epicycle']\n",
      "However, I said in Chapter 39 that it appeared absurd to me that the planet [in moving] from γ to D at a nonuniform pace disengages itself from the ray of the solar power, and thus accommodates itself by its own force to the extrinsic force from the sun, and has foreknowledge of its speed and the decrease thereof. ['solar']\n",
      "While the center of the epicycle N and its aphelion [in moving] from the line AC to Aγ will be slow from C to γ, it being near the eccentric's aphelion C, let the planet [in moving] from γ to D be supposed not to be slow but to proceed with its mean motion. ['epicycle']\n",
      "This same thing was also affirmed by the physical equations constructed through the summation of the distances AC, AD, namely, that the planet ought to be faster at the sides of the eccentric; that is, that its distances from the sun ought to be supposed smaller. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, since this consensus brought to bear a considerable force of persuasion, I concluded forthwith that the planet's incursion at the sides is the result of this: that the power moving the planet and administering the distances according to the law of the circle supersedes the power of the sun, in that the former made equal progress in equal times thus sending the planet down uniformly towards the sun according to the law of the epicycle, while the latter, in its varying degrees [of speed obtained] through the varying distances, moved the planet in its care forward nonuniformly, and more slowly when it is high. ['epicycle']\n",
      "It thus happened that the distances of equal arcs on the epicycle were accumulated near the aphelion C and the perihelion F, and were more sparsely scattered about the middle elongations. ['epicycle']\n",
      "In this way, all the shorter ones were drawn back upwards from the correct [circular] distances from perihelion to the place of longer ones. ['perihelion']\n",
      "That error therefore began to become rooted in me which I had happily begun to refute in Chapter 39 above, that it is a property of the planetary power to lead the body of the planet around in the path of an epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Had the diameter of the epicycle ND remained equidistant from AB, I could have shed my erroneous opinion, and could have ascribed (as is perfectly correct) all promotion in zodiacal longitude to the sun, leaving to the planet only the reciprocation on the diameter γζ, as in part of Chapter 39. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But because the observations testified that the diameter of the epicycle is inclined in the middle elongations, this error concerning the motion of the planet on the circumference of the epicycle, whose motion would be regular measured with respect to the line ΑΝγ going from the sun A through the center of  the epicycle N, was admirably confirmed in me. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For I did not think it possible for the planet's orbit to be rendered oval in any other way. ['orbit']\n",
      "In the preceding chapter a cause was stated by which it could happen that the planet depart from a circular orbit. ['orbit']\n",
      "For the epicycle is inclined according to the length of the distances, while the multitude and length of the distances is in turn dependent upon the rotation of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And because the sum of the distances is contained in the plane of the eccentric, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, that sum cannot be found unless the epicycle be transformed into an eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But it was demonstrated in Chapter 2, and repeated in Chapter 39, and used in Chapter 40, that if a concentric be described about center α with semidiameter equal to βδ, and on it an epicycle with semidiameter αβ; and then about center β an eccentric δλ with eccentricity αβ; and afterwards the circumferences of both the epicycle and the eccentric δλ be divided into similar parts; the distances of the points of division, both of the epicycle and the eccentric, from the chosen point α are respectively equal to one another in length. ['epicycle']\n",
      "On this premise, since in Chapter 40 we posited an eccentric to present a plain and easy demonstration, and a method of computing the distances, here, too, we can examine the distances on the eccentric, even though we are supposing them to be meted out by the uniform motion of the planet’s epicycle. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Let us therefore say, for the sake  of understanding, that in the circuit of the epicycle the planet makes digressions from the sun α of the same magnitude as if it were on the circumference of a perfect eccentric δλ (and let this be a semicircle defined by the straight line λαβδ) describing equal arcs in equal times, such as δε, εζ, ζθ, θι, ικ, κλ. ['circuit']\n",
      "If the planet were moved forward with the same degree of power from the sun at both δ and λ, in the same manner as the epicyclical rotation is supposed to be always uniformly set in motion, then it really would traverse these equal parts of the eccentric, from which we have taken the distances, in equal times; and also, the distances corresponding to the times denoted by the points of division would be these very ones, αδ, αε, αζ, αθ, αι, ακ, αλ, not only in quantity, but also in their identical position. ['eccentric']\n",
      "The planet does in fact represent quantitatively the reported distances resulting from the uniform rotation of the epicycle, but is itself moved forward unequally in equal times by the sun, less at δ, more at λ. Thus in the time signified and measured by δβε*,  it does not traverse the space δε, although it does attain the distance αε. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Also, the plane δαε, δαζ, and so on, contains in itself the sum of the distances of all the points on the arc of the epicycle, which, by Chapter 40, is similar to the arc δε. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And on our fictitious eccentric δθλ the measure of the time is δε, δζ for finding out the distances αε, αζ, while the ratio of the sectors δβε, δβζ to one another is the same as that of the arcs δε, δζ. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Since geometry has left us destitute, in order that we may have a  description of the line which has been born to us out of the theory of Chapter 45, let us go seek the assistance of a contrivance4 by fetching our vicarious hypothesis from Chapter 16, which places the lines αμ, αν, and so on, on which the planet stands, at the correct zodiacal places at the correct times, combining it with the present fictitious eccentric δθλ, from which the theory of Chapter 45 has persuaded us that we have derived the correct length of the lines αε, αζ; that is, αμ, αν. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And besides, it is a good idea for the sake of shedding some light to compare the two hypotheses with one another, combined into one diagram. ['diagram']\n",
      "And in this diagram, many things which have been said so far are brought together into a single view. ['diagram']\n",

      "For, taking any known angle of mean anomaly, let a dashed straight line, DH, be drawn from the center of the equant D bounded by a point on the circumference, containing between itself and the line of apsides the required angle,*  which is the measure of the proposed time.

      "And let the point H be connected to A. The angle IAH will thus be the equated anomaly and the true zodiacal position of AH, and the planet most certainly will be on the line AH at the given time and anomaly, by Ch. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "But the distance AH will be false, and the planet will not be at the point H, because the division of AD at C and the eccentric H described about C are false by Ch. ['eccentric']\n",
      "There it was shown  that AD is to be bisected at B, so as to describe a more correct eccentric IL about B, but it will not be a perfect circle. ['eccentric']\n",

      "This is the one which in the diagram before the last was described as δθλ, about center β. And let the mean anomaly, which was previously proposed to us in the form of time, be transferred from D to B, and the straight line BF be drawn from B parallel to the former DH. ['diagram']\n",
      "And let the point of intersection F of the new eccentric be connected with A. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For at the selected time and mean anomaly the planet is not found on AF. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Thus through the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16, which consists of the points A, C, D, and the eccentric H, we have made up for the defect of geometry, which was unable to show us the position of the line AG (onto which the correct distance AF is to be transferred) which we required of the hypothesis of Chapter 45.

      "One might ask, \"Couldn't we, in the former diagram just as well as in the  latter, take as given the point γ of uniform motion, and from it draw γμ, γν, γο, γπ, γρ parallel to βε, βζ, βθ, βι, βκ, and draw the arcs εμ, ζν, θο, ιπ, κρ intersecting these parallels? ['diagram']\n",

      "But in addition, that greater number of long [distances] is crowded into a narrower arc of the eccentric by being translated upwards, while these fewer [shorter] ones are spread out into a larger arc. ['eccentric']\n",

      "Now since the point τ is equally remote from α and β, we are (following the Arabs in using the term most properly) at the middle elongation, that is, at the average distance of the planet τ from the sun α. And because γφ is parallel to βτ, the point ψ on the line αφ (in the diagram of the previous chapter) is the genuine and most true position of the translation of ατ to αψ. ['elongation']\n",

Therefore, given the eccentricity αβ and the angle θαβ, and supposing that the planet is at the point θ of the circumference, the angle θβδ will be given, and hence also the sector of the perfect circle, namely, θδβ, and the area of the triangle θβα, that is, the whole area θδα which (with the exceptions in Chapter 40 above) ought to have been the measure of the time elapsed while the planet moves from δ to θ, if the planet had gone in a perfect circle. ['diagram']\n",
      "But because it describes an oval inside the circle, not embracing the full area of the perfect circle, so, exactly as just a moment ago we needed knowledge of the area of the whole ovoid, we now need to know what portion of the ovoid is contained between the lines δα and αθ, that is, what portion the area of the part δθ of the lunule is of the area that measures the two lunules, namely, of the area of the small circle on the eccentricity.

      "So the eccentricity still can be increased, and up above, [moving] from aphelion, the planet is made to be slightly slower than it should be, and the  same near perihelion, and therefore it is swifter than it should be at the middle elongations, as was also found before in Chapter 47.

Now let some time have passed from when the planet was at B, and let its measure be CDE, the angle on the epicycle, in order that as the aphelion of the epicycle B is translated to C, and the center of the epicycle G to D, the planet will have moved on the epicycle from C to E. Therefore, in order to know the angle DAB at the time CDE, consider that the planet has passed across from B to E by two powers. ['epicycle']\n",

      "AB, AE, is also presumed to make the same impression upon the center of the epicycle GD. ['epicycle']\n",
      "This is because if the planet had not disengaged itself from the ray of power AB or AC and move towards B, but only descended towards the sun, it would then still be at the point F*  on AC, on which line the center of the epicycle D also lies. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And it has disengaged itself by the law of the epicycle, at the distance DE and the angle CDE (for this is prescribed by the opinion of Chapter 45, under which we are operating here). ['epicycle']\n",
      "Thus by a kind of fiction for itself it places the center of its epicycle at D. For we have said in Ch. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But this should not stand in our way, for BE, and BF too, are composed of two powers, and if anything is disturbed in the proportion this comes from the planet's making its  own descent on the circumference of the epicycle (following the opinion of Chapter 45). ['epicycle']\n",
      "For if the planet had remained at the highest point of its epicycle, and had been subject to the same motive force from the sun, adumbrated by AB, AE, which is nonuniform (which indeed cannot happen simultaneously, for when the distance of the planet from the sun remains the same, the motive strength from the sun remains the same), then a perfect arc of a greater circle BC would have been described, whose ratio to the whole BC is the same which the arc GD has to the whole GD. ['epicycle']\n",
      "I am indeed aware that if the planet is supposed to be on a smaller perimeter, that of the center of the epicycle DG, it will go much faster. ['epicycle']\n",
      "But that is not a reason for assigning a greater speed to the center of the epicycle. ['epicycle']\n",
      "For, by supposition, the center of the epicycle moves, not in its own right, since it is not a body, but because of the planet. ['epicycle']\n",
      "It is thus presupposed that the planet moves its own body away from the solar rays according to the law of the epicycle, and makes use of certain rays of power from the sun for its position (ideas which were indeed rejected in Ch. ['solar']\n",

      "So, since an integral equation is to be computed, that is, the equated anomaly for a given mean anomaly, first, with the mean anomaly CDE measured on the epicycle, you extract the angle DAG or CAB from the latter catalog, the one with the sum of the angles. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "And with the same mean anomaly, you also extract the part of the equation CAE from the previous catalog. ['mean anomaly']\n",

      "First, with eccentricity 9165, which is a little less than the correct value, I sought out all the distances, according to the procedure shown in Chapter 29. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "These corresponded to integral degrees of an anomaly occupying a middle position between the mean anomaly and the true equated anomaly. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "*  In the second diagram of Chapter 46 it is the angle FAB, and in the following one, CAD. ['diagram']\n",
      "Let A be the sun, B the center of the eccentric CD, BC the semidiameter. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, if there were no physical cause of the equation, and CBD were the measure of the time or mean anomaly, then there would correspond to it this value for CAD, truly equated. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Here it was supposed that in the time CBD the planet traverses an angle EBD about the center of the eccentric B equal to CAD, and therefore, that as many distances from A were collected for the equal arcs ED of its eccentric as we found here on equal degrees of CAD. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, the angle CBD would here be the mean anomaly of distance, giving the angle CAD, for finding the distances CA, from which the angle CAE, the physical slowing and translation of CA to EA, is deduced. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Although it cannot show much of a discrepancy from the prior method of Chapter 49, this procedure assumes without demonstration that CAD and  EBD are equal, and consequently, that CA and EB are parallel, which was refuted above in the second diagram of Ch. ['diagram']\n",
      "The eccentricity was charged with being too small, and indeed, it really is greater, 9264 instead of 9165. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Also, the planet was made to go too slowly near the apsides, and too fast near the middle elongations. ['apsides']\n",
      "The question therefore followed: did the lines AF, AG proportional to AC, AD correctly express the elapsed time over CD, thus allowing CAD to remain the true equated anomaly? ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "Therefore, the orbit will be a perfect circle, which was refuted in Ch. ['orbit']\n",
      "Therefore, the distances at the middle elongations, coming out longer than they should be, will make the planet slower than it should be there, and hence it will be faster at the apsides. ['apsides']\n",
      "First, the eccentricity is charged with being too small, since the maximum equation comes out to be 10° 29⅕’, which is 10° 34½’ in the vicarious hypothesis. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Second, at the time 52° 39⅔’ the planet is found to have traversed as much of its path from the apsis as was traversed in the vicarious in the longer time of 52° 53'. ['apsis']\n",
      "If the eccentricity were adjusted, all the values of the equated anomaly would be increased, so that, in the lower quadrant also, in the time of 37° 44' (the supplement of 142° 16', which has been adjusted by increasing the eccentricity), the planet will traverse as much of the path as it traverses in the vicarious in the longer time of 37° 51', which is the supplement of 142° 9': that is, both will traverse 45°, which is the supplement of 135°. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And you will note again what  was observed in Ch. ['observed']\n",
      "So, since this second method did not accord with reason either, and in the first I learned that the distances are to be sought out corresponding to integral degrees of the angle CBD or to equal arcs of the eccentric CD, I also proceeded to the distances. ['eccentric']\n",
      "But now, CBD no longer remained the [mean] anomaly, as it formerly was in the first method, but was made the eccentric anomaly by this relating of the distances, as it also is in the second method. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Now, in the previous diagram, we shall proceed demonstratively, using the equated anomaly CAD to obtain the eccentric anomaly CBD, and further, through this eccentric anomaly CBD learning the sum of the distances found on the arc CD. ['diagram']\n",
      "And by this sum of the distances, we shall obtain the elapsed time over the arc CD, or the mean anomaly. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "But again, as before in the second method, CAD becomes the true equated anomaly, and thus CA remains in place, and the orbit DC will be a perfect circle. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "44, it necessarily follows that the distances at the middle elongations are taken to be too long here, and consequently that the times are made longer than they should be, and shorter at the apsides. ['apsides']\n",
      "The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "The reason why the signs for excess are turned into signs for defect, is that here the difference shows errors in the equated anomaly, while there they are in the mean anomaly. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "And if you want to test them with the results of a calculation, you will find that to a mean anomaly of 53° 23' 56\" there corresponds an equated anomaly of 46° 0', which in the vicarious hypothesis comes out to be about 45° 27', a difference of 33', clearly absurd. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "So, since I accomplished nothing with these four methods, I then took the mean anomaly and the distances assigned to it (in the fifth operation) and went over to the table of the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16, and the true equated anomaly. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Let the second diagram in Chapter 46 be taken up again. ['diagram']\n",
      "Then, the distances AF belonging to integral degrees of mean anomaly IBF or IDH, also belong to the degrees and minutes of the equated anomaly IAH, which in the table mentioned corresponded to the mean anomaly IDH itself. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "16, that is, from the unequal angles HAI, to the individual integral degrees of the equated anomaly HAI, that is, to equal parts. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "In this translation of distances we moved all the long ones upwards, and made them fewer, establishing large arcs IG of the oval path above, at aphelion, and thus attributing the individual distances to the individual degrees, not of the anomaly FAB, as in the first method, but of HAB, which is the true equated anomaly. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Let the diagram belonging to this chapter be repeated, and let it be recalled to mind what was said about the first method. ['diagram']\n",
      "For in it the equated anomaly of distance CAD was divided into equal degrees. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "However, it was not from the sum of the distances found on CD, but from a mingling of the vicarious hypothesis with the hypothesis of the distances framed in Chapter 46, that the translation of AC to AE was now made and perfected, and the arc ED was attributed to the mean anomaly (which we have numbered on the  arc CD for finding the distance CA or EA). ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "So the mean anomaly already given from the vicarious hypothesis cannot be had from the sum of the distances on EAD. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "In order to find the distance CA let the mean anomaly CBD be 48° 44'. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "And these, gathered into a single sum, will constitute a mean anomaly which is by no means equal to the one first taken, DC, but is equal to another, DO, which shows the distance AO, to be transferred to AN. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "\"4 For the question was whether all the distances on the equal degrees of ED, gathered into a sum, would show the mean anomaly DC. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "For the true quantities of orbital arcs that appear equal from the center of the sun are in the ratio of the distances: thus to the extent that AE is longer, so is ED. ['orbital']\n",
      "But the times of truly equal arcs, as measured on the orbit, are also in the ratio of the distances. ['orbit']\n",
      "And so the measures of the times that the planet accumulates over equal degrees of the angle EAD are the proportional lines AG, AF, belonging to the integral degrees or equal parts of the angle of true equated anomaly EAD. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "Therefore, let the proportionals to the distances at equal degrees of equated anomaly be tested, just as other distances were also tested above in this chapter. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "As, since 35,692,048, the sum of all 360 distances, at all 360 equal parts of the angle at the sun, is equivalent to an elapsed time of 360°, what is the value of a just and correct sum at any given degree of equated anomaly? ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Thus here, too, the planet is not made to go fast enough at the apsides, and so there are too many distances near the apsides, and consequently less than there should be at the middle elongations. ['apsides']\n",
      "There we had introduced fictitious rays of power in order to be able also to ascribe to the epicycle its own task of disengaging itself from those fictitious rays (for in the truth of the matter no rays go around as slowly as the center of the planetary epicycle goes, as was said in Ch. ['rays']\n",
      "And nevertheless, we left all the physical force carrying the planet around (as concerns the effect) to the sun, so that the epicycle would only serve to adjust the distances. ['epicycle']\n",
      "Here, we made use of the same power of the sun for the physical translation, while we again computed the distances from the epicycle, and gave its equal parts to equal times, that is, to equal degrees of mean anomaly, as the opinion of Ch. ['epicycle']\n",
      "And if we ended up taking as many distances in any given part of the time as there are degrees of equated anomaly, they are still derived from the distances of the mean anomaly, and in length they are the same. ['equated anomaly']\n",
      "For, as was noted just above in considering the second method, this preoccupation with epicyclic motion is excessive, showing distances at the middle elongations that are too small, from which it happens that at that place the planet exceeds its measure of velocity, and at the apsides falls short of its measure. ['apsides']\n",
      "32 that this ratio of diurnal motions cannot be constant, since the parts of the eccentric near the apsides are presented directly to the sun, and the intermediate are presented obliquely, so that they thus appear differently from the way they would if they were presented directly— if anyone, I say, were to raise this objection, I shall answer as I did in Ch.

      "Suppose, however, that that same person were to divide an ellipse AMC into the same number of unequal arcs, contrary to Protheorem 10, according to the following law: the circle AKC being first divided into equal arcs, perpendiculars KL would then be drawn to AC from the ends of the individual arcs, cutting the ellipse AM into arcs also; and the elliptical area would be taken for the distances of these arcs from N. In that case, a remedy would be provided for the error which has been committed: a most perfect compensation. ['elliptical']\n",

['apsides']\n",
      "Thus where the  distances are too short with respect to their erroneous sum, in the faulty area of the proposed ellipse, the arcs will be small with respect to their mean value, as at A, C; and where the distances are too long, the arcs are too long, as at B. And so to the extent that we accumulate too small an interval of time in our calculation, owing to the rather short distances at the apsides, there are that many more distances on that arc, it being cut into small parts each of which has its own assigned distance.

['latitude']\n",
      "That is, the former seeks the sun or flees it, while the latter, rather than seeking by sailing towards, or fleeing, those sidereal positions beneath which the limits of the latitude are reached, is only directed towards those positions, as a magnet towards the pole (for likewise, a magnet does not sail towards the polar region even if it floats freely) ^1.

Now, at the limits, although it has indeed remained inclined to the plane of the ecliptic CBS (for we have said that it remains equidistant from itself in all positions, and so once it is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic it will always be inclined), it nevertheless does not continue to decline from the royal road itself, that is, from the circumference of the plane of the ecliptic CBAD, once it is placed at GH.

      "Here, the axis follows these equidistant positions by the force of our directional power itself, with no need of an animate power or of reasoning. ['axis']\n",
      "Someone might, however, consider it the act of a mind, that the diameter that effects the latitude points directly towards the center of the sun when the planet is located at the limits, thus making a great circle of the  planet's orbit, and causing the nodes to be at opposite positions with respect to the sun. ['latitude']\n",
      "It is of course true that he who first ordained the heavenly motions so directed this axis as to point at the sun when at the appointed position, and did so deliberately and with perfect rationality. ['axis']\n",

      "First, the apsides of the sun and Mars are not in conjunction, and second, the planets' orbits are not perfect circles. ['apsides']\n",

      "But the straight line BC projected through the centers of the circles is directed towards 24½ Leo and Aquarius, approximately; in the same direction, that is, in which Brahe put his line of apsides HF, to which our line BC runs parallel, both eccentricities being bisected, AF at C, and AH at B.

      "And I was now about to choose the mean between 17° Leo and 25° Leo, namely, 21° Leo, but the year 1585 gave me pause, since in that year the latitude observed at 21° 36' Leo was clearly not a maximum. ['latitude']\n",
      "For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4° 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4° 31'. ['opposition']\n",
      "It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4° 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.

      "\"It is worthy of consideration that on about the tenth day of August Mars had its maximum southern latitude, and that it decreased afterwards, so that at opposition on the 24th it was about one fourth of a degree nearer to the ecliptic. ['latitude']\n",

      "When I later had come to him in Bohemia, and frequently inquired about how the latitudes are arranged, he answered that the nodes are at opposite positions, and the line of intersection passes through the point of the sun's mean position, or through the center of its epicycle (for which see Ch. ['nodes']\n",
      "Reminded by this mention, he said, regarding the present matter, \"this is remarkable, that the latitudes reach their maximum before or after opposition to the sun.\" ['opposition']\n",
      "The cause of this occurrence is in fact contained in the true hypothesis of  the latitude established in this fifth part; however, you would have almost as much trouble finding the boundaries of the maximum latitudes geometrically, as Apollonius of Perga had in finding the boundaries of the stations. ['latitude']\n",
      "And matters stand just the same with the maximum latitude for any given occurrence. ['latitude']\n",
      "For the latitude is greatest when the distance of  Mars from the earth is increasing or decreasing in the same ratio in which the lines of Mars's inclinations increase or decrease. ['latitude']\n",
      "And the latitude is increasing when the ratio of the distance decreases more than the ratio of the lines of inclination, or when the former is decreasing while the latter, on the contrary, is increasing. ['latitude']\n",
      "And, in turn, the latitude is decreasing either when the distance of Mars from the earth increases more than the lines of inclination, each in its own proportion, or when the distance is increasing while the lines are decreasing. ['latitude']\n",
      "These conditions are satisfied indiscriminately, now at opposition, now before, now after, depending on whether the opposition falls at the limit, or before, or after the limit. ['opposition']\n",
      "25 or March 6, the northern latitude was a maximum, while opposition followed by an entire month. ['latitude']\n",
      "27 or October 7, in turn, the southern latitude was a maximum, while Mars was between its quintile and sextile aspects to the sun ^4. ['latitude']\n",

      "But in 1607, the maximum northern latitude occurred a little after the conjunction of Mars with the sun. ['latitude']\n",
      "The reason why these things would appear remarkable in ancient astronomy is chiefly that Ptolemy and his imitators had fabricated the extremely intricate motions of inclination, deviation and reflection ^6. ['inclination']\n",
      "For since Ptolemy clung to his invention of the epicycle, as soon as he saw that when the planet was at opposition to the sun (and was thus visible) the epicycle went out to one side, he immediately indulged in conjecture, asserting that at conjunction with the sun, when it is not visible, the epicycle goes out in the other direction, and generally, that at conjunction the epicycle does the opposite of what he observed it to do at opposition.

['eccentric']\n",
      "And since 2° 40’ 48\" Pisces, the position on the orbit, is distant from 16° 43' Taurus10 by 74° 2', the inclination will therefore be 1° 46' 10\". ['orbit']\n",

      "So now, using these angles of the operation, I find the apparent latitude LCB to be 6° 19' 10\", very nearly the same as the observed value ^12. ['apparent latitude']\n",
      "And, I would add, it shows this in all its simplicity, in that the plane of the eccentric is given a constant inclination or obliquity, and this is variously increased or diminished, not in reality, but optically only, insofar as our sighting approaches it or recedes from it, or (for Brahe and Ptolemy) it approaches or recedes from our sighting. ['eccentric']\n",
      "From the positions of the nodes and the inclination of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic, it is demonstrated that the eccentricity of Mars takes its origin, not from the point of the sun's mean position (or, for Brahe, the center of the sun's epicycle), but from the very center of the sun. ['nodes']\n",
      "This is done first through the positions of the nodes. ['nodes']\n",
      "It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed? ['apparent motion']\n",

      "This will fall at positions exactly opposite about β, but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through κ, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above βς by the distance κς. ['nodes']\n",
      "It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point κ is connected to the points of intersection of the line βς with the circumference of the eccentric. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And since κβ is the sun's eccentricity, 3600, where the orb of the earth or the sun is 100,000, therefore, as the whole sine of the angle ς is to βκ, 3600, so is the sine of angle β to κς, 2717. ['eccentricity']\n",

      "The ascending node [P'] should therefore have been moved backward, and the descending node [P] moved forward, by that number of degrees, minutes, and seconds, if I had been mistaken in taking the sun's center κ instead of the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Brahean point β. But in turn, where the observations are referred to the mean sun, and thus the point β is taken, if this is done in error, and κ should have been chosen instead, the ascending node [Ν'] found from β should be in a place farther forward, and the descending node [N] farther back, so as to shorten the northern semicircle [N’ηN] by an arc of 2° 3' 6\".

      "The great circle IO of the rotating solar body will thus be arranged beneath some great circle of the fixed stars: let this be ML. ['solar']\n",
      "Therefore, beyond doubt, the various circles of all the planets depend upon this \"royal circle\" ML, described by the rotation of the solar body about its axis AE, and each of them will keep its inclination to this circle constant in quantity, though having a translational motion, since we know by experience that the nodes are transposed. ['solar']\n",
      "Since the ecliptic, too, is one of the planetary circles, either the sun's or the earth's, it is consistent for it, too, to have some inclination to the royal circle ML, described among the fixed stars by the great circle IO of the solar body. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "For what would be the reason why the other planets would decline from one another, while the ecliptic alone, standing above the solar or the terrestrial path, coincides exactly with this royal circle ML? ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Let this therefore be granted: that the ecliptic, properly so called, is inclined to the royal solar circle. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Under these conditions, we easily discover the occasion of the alteration of the fixed stars' latitudes: as the name suggests, these are computed from the true ecliptic and not from that royal solar circle, hitherto unknown. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "For the intersections or common nodes of the ecliptic, truly and properly so called (as a result of eclipses' occurring only beneath that line along which the sun proceeds), with the circle ML, which we might call the \"mean ecliptic\", will be carried along no less than the nodes of the other planets. ['intersections']\n",
      "Nevertheless, the maximum obliquity MK or LH, which is measured by the distance of the poles FB, GC, remains fixed and constant, as in the  rest of the planets. ['obliquity']\n",
      "That is, if about centers F, G, with constant radii FB, GC, small circles be described upon which we suppose the poles of the ecliptic B, C, to revolve, then the circle KH as well will depart from its original position on the sphere of the fixed stars FMG, and over the ages will make the southern limit come to be near the same fixed stars where the northern limit once was. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "However, since the nodes have progressed by the same amount from their fixed stars, the latitudes of their fixed stars will be altered more evidently. ['nodes']\n",
      "This is because at the end of the quadrant, near the limit, the sines of the inclinations increase by imperceptible increments, while at the beginning, near the nodes, these increments are quite perceptible. ['nodes']\n",
      "Hence, because no change in the latitudes of the fixed stars is perceived near the equinoxes, while it is noticeable enough near the solstices, we correctly conclude that the limits of the ecliptic's latitudes are near the equinoxes, and the nodes are near the solstices. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "We likewise  conclude this: that since the northern part of the true ecliptic flees from the north, in that the northern latitudes are increasing in Gemini and Cancer, the ecliptic's northern limit is therefore either in Libra, if the nodes progress, or in Aries, if (as is more probable) they retrogress. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "For the moon's nodes also retrogress, traversing the zodiac in 19 years, while the apogee progresses, traversing it in 8½ years. ['nodes']\n",
      "Now the sun's apogee, or the earth's perihelion, is at 5½° Cancer, and thus by Chapter 57, the diameter of power, causing the eccentricity, points at the sun when the earth is at 5½° Aries. ['apogee']\n",
      "But also, by Chapter 63, the diameter of power that causes the latitude points at the sun when the earth is at the limit, which is in Aries by the present Chapter 68. ['latitude']\n",
      "Hence one may argue plausibly that this invisible circle or mean ecliptic and the true one known to us coincide at 5½° Cancer and Capricorn. ['mean ecliptic']\n",
      "For then it could be true of all planets, as it is here in the earth's circuits, that the nodes coincide with the apsides, and thus both variations—that of the eccentricity (in height) and that of the the obliquity (in latitude)—are effected by the same diameter of power. ['nodes']\n",
      "Therefore, the southern limit of the true ecliptic would be in Libra, and the northern in Aries, which agrees with the above. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "A full consideration of this question must, however, be deferred until the motions of all the planets are examined with reference to the true ecliptic, the one known to us. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Further confirmation of this opinion of a hidden royal circle, projected  from the sun among the fixed stars, is provided by the obliquity of the ecliptic that is in common use, which is computed from the equator, but which we  might more correctly call the equator's latitude from the ecliptic. ['obliquity']\n",
      "Now the  equator is the great circle of the earth's body that is intermediate between the poles of the earth's daily rotation on its axis. ['axis']\n",
      "Hence this axis, and this great circle, are inclined to the ecliptic differently in different eras. ['axis']\n",
      "For to the extent that the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Cancer, and the southern latitude in Capricorn, is greater today, the equator's latitude from the ecliptic is smaller than it was once, since this obliquity is greatest in Cancer and Capricorn. ['latitude']\n",
      "It was once 23° 51½’, while today it is 23° 31½’, the difference of 20' being the change in latitude of the fixed stars. ['latitude']\n",
      "It is, however, reasonable to suppose that the circle of the equator with its axis and poles would forever decline from the poles of this ecliptic HK by an equal and fixed distance, if the true ecliptic were the world's primary circle. ['axis']\n",
      "But the ecliptic has changed, and the inclination of this axis to the ecliptic (and with it the inclination of the equator, to which this axis belongs) has been altered, so that to the extent that the ecliptic has receded from the fixed stars in Cancer, it has approached the equator. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Therefore, the equator appears to maintain a constant inclination to some other circle. ['inclination']\n",
      "And thus from all these plausible arguments there arises a royal circle LOM, middle among the circles of the planets, to which all the planets, and Mars with them, maintain a constant inclination. ['inclination']\n",
      "The example of the moon should not trouble us, whose inclination to the ecliptic, but not to any other great circle, is a constant 5°, both in the past and today, even though the ecliptic has been moved. ['inclination']\n",

      "The eccentricities of the others and the whole theory of longitude and latitude originate from the sun, while those of the moon originate from the moving earth. ['longitude']\n",
      "What wonder, then, if the moon keeps the limits of its latitude constant with respect to the changeable ecliptic HK, beneath which lies the terrestrial circle, while the other planets do so with respect to some other invariable circle, such as LOIM? ['latitude']\n",
      "It is therefore granted that Mars's orbit is inclined at a constant angle to some circle that maintains its position beneath the same fixed stars, such as  LOIM. ['orbit']\n",
      "It follows that this same orbit of Mars has different inclinations to the ecliptic HK in different ages, since in certain of its parts it leaves the fixed stars it originally lay beneath and moves on to others. ['orbit']\n",
      "This only follows, however, if we grant that the nodes of Mars and the nodes of the earth, that is, the intersections of these orbits with the invisible circle LOIM, are not always carried over the same intervals in the heavens, some being faster than others. ['nodes']\n",
      "For since the equator maintains a constant inclination to this invisible circle LOIM, while the ecliptic is meanwhile moved, the declination of the equator from the ecliptic is consequently perceived to be changeable. ['inclination']\n",

['north']\n",
      "If the nodes of the ecliptic also retrogress, the northern limit must be placed near the fixed stars in the region of Aries and Pisces. ['nodes']\n",
      "For the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Gemini and Cancer has increased, as was previously said. ['latitude']\n",
      "Thus the circle AD extended will pass through the solstice of the intermediate time. ['solstice']\n",

      "Therefore, close to the line AE there would be the pole of the circle beneath which the orbit and circuit of the earth was once arranged. ['orbit']\n",
      "And because the northern limit is in Aries, let EA be extended in the direction of A, and let the point I be taken on the extension below A. Thus the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic would be at I. About center A with radius AI let a small circle be described, on which let another point O be taken, nearer to C than I is to B. And let O be the present pole of the ecliptic, 23° 31½’ from C, while I, the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic, is 23° 51½’ from B. This will be the theory of the ecliptic's altered obliquity and of the altered latitude of the fixed stars, except that the size of the small circle OI is not known to us. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "For the ecliptic's 20' alteration of obliquity can be produced in various ways. ['ecliptic']\n",

      "Today’s obliquity OF, or the inclination of the plane of Mars to the ecliptic, will be greater, and the Ptolemaic obliquity HI will be smaller. ['obliquity']\n",
      "Nevertheless the pole of Mars’s orbit H, F would have moved from H to F keeping at a constant distance AH, AF from A.\n",
      "And since the pole of the Martian orbit has traversed a fairly large arc from H to F, whether forward or backward, but at the same time the pole of the ecliptic has gone from I to O about the same point A, the pole of Mars would appear to be nearly at rest, since IH and OF are nearly parallel.

      "For since the northern latitude of Mars is with Cor Leonis, a northern star, while the southern latitude is with the southern stars of Capricorn, it is reasonable that the same happened to Mars's maximum latitudes as happened to those stars: they both increased. ['latitude']\n",
      "For the stars' latitudes did increase, the northern ones around the summer solstice, and the southern ones around the winter solstice. ['solstice']\n",
      "Ptolemy therefore said that Mars's maximum observed northern latitude was 4° 20', while today it is 4° 32' ^2. ['observed']\n",

      "Therefore, as long as we are wanting suitable observations from antiquity, circumstances compel us to leave this discussion of the motion of the nodes, along with many other matters, to posterity, if, indeed, it should please God to vouchsafe the human race a length of time in this world sufficient to work through such remaining questions thoroughly.

      "A consideration of three Ptolemaic observations, and the correction of the mean motion and of the motion of the aphelion and nodes. ['aphelion']\n",
      "From all antiquity, there have survived no more than five written observations of the star Mars, as well as one of extreme antiquity noted by Aristotle, who saw Mars occulted by the dark part of the half moon. ['star']\n",
      "The second observation, obtained from the Chaldeans, was preserved for us by Ptolemy. ['observation']\n",
      "This was made  on the morning of January 18, 272 BC, when Mars occulted the northern star in the head of Scorpius ^3. ['star']\n",
      "However, he reports only the zodiacal position at the exact moment of Mars's opposition to the sun's mean motion ^4. ['opposition']\n",
      "Next, it seems possible to use the Chaldean observation to inquire whether the solar eccentricity was really once greater than it is today. ['observation']\n",
      "And then, using both this observation and the Aristotelian one, if the time were known, one could hazard a guess at Mars's latitude at those times. ['observation']\n",
      "First, at the times set out, he records the mean position of the sun by a calculation that depends upon observation of the equinoxes and solstices. ['observation']\n",
      "For we call the beginning of Aries that point that the sun occupies when the day is observed to equal the nights. ['observed']\n",
      "My hope is that he observed the meridian altitudes, for by induction from these the moment of the sun's entering the northern hemisphere is obtained without error. ['observed']\n",
      "But what if he had observed it using Alexandrian armillaries, where refraction could have put him off? ['observed']\n",
      "He ascribes this to instrumental error; I, however, suspect that the error arose from refraction ^5. ['refraction']\n",
      "Let it stand, however: let him have observed it through meridian altitudes. ['observed']\n",
      "This fact has given rise to many extremely complicated opinions on the heavens, and gave birth to the motions of trepidation and libration, all of which are brought to ruin once one sees that the observations after Ptolemy always agree to the point of equality with the most ancient ones of Hipparchus. ['rise']\n",
      "For if, as a result of instrumental error, he had pronounced the true equinox to be on the following day, when it had occurred on the  previous one, the autumnal equinox would have been pronounced to be on the previous day when it belonged on the following one. ['autumnal equinox']\n",
      "If two days were thus subtracted from the length of the summer, a great alteration in the sun's eccentricity would have resulted. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "So no alternative is left us but to trust Ptolemy in believing him to have observed correctly the time at which the sun stood at the beginning of Aries. ['observed']\n",
      "Once a beginning is made, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is found through  observation, it is a trivial matter to use the sun's declinations on each day to report its elongation from the point occupied by the sun at the time stated to be the moment of the equinox, whatever it might be or in whichever sphere it might be established. ['obliquity']\n",
      "There follows a demonstration of the equation, which depends upon the sun's  observed entry into the beginnings of the cardinal signs. ['observed']\n",
      "For when the equation is subtracted from or added to the sun's apparent position, the sun's mean motion is established with respect to the point which the sun is observed to occupy at the time of the equinox. ['observed']\n",
      "If we substitute the modern equations for Ptolemy's, we shall not change his observations as much as Ptolemy himself says he can discern in observing, nor as much as the Ptolemaic observations can be vitiated by the matter of refraction. ['refraction']\n",
      "For we can with  certainty name the day of the Ptolemaic equinox observation, though meanwhile remaining uncertain about the time of day. ['observation']\n",
      "We can, however, proceed on a twofold path: either we believe Ptolemy on the equinoxes, or, using the modern equations, we apply a correction to the Ptolemaic equinoxes, making the vernal equinox three hours later than that noted by Ptolemy, and the autumnal earlier by the same amount, the result being an error of 8' in the sun's declination at each place. ['vernal equinox']\n",
      "But what shall we now say of the sun's entry into Cancer and Capricorn, upon which the apogee and the setting out of the equations depends? ['apogee']\n",
      "I find it more credible that throughout the summer they were carefully noting the sun's declinations, and were matching up the equal ones on both sides of the solstice, taking as the true entry of the sun into Cancer the time intermediate between the moments of equal declinations. ['solstice']\n",
      "In this way, if a comparison had been made of positions near to the solstice, there would indeed be little error, but there still could have occurred as much as a quarter of a day, during which time 15' of the sun's motion elapse. ['solstice']\n",
      "Therefore, even if the equinoxes were perfectly certain, it is nonetheless possible that there be an excess or defect of a quarter of a degree in the sun's position in the two segments about the solstice, and that the apogee should then fall eight degrees farther forward or farther back. ['solstice']\n",
      "If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars. ['fixed star']\n",
      "Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error. ['elongation']\n",
      "Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon. ['elongation']\n",
      "Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*. ['elongation']\n",
      "Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed. ['elongation']\n",
      "But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree. ['refraction']\n",
      "Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial. ['elongation']\n",
      "Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition. ['observed']\n",
      "So when these four observed positions of Mars are presented by Ptolemy: 21° 0' Gemini, 28° 50' Leo, 2° 34' Sagittarius, 1° 36' Sagittarius; we should take these: 21° 30' Gemini, 29° 20' Leo, 3° 4' Sagittarius, 2° 6' Sagittarius. ['observed']\n",
      "Now Ptolemy actually defended himself against such presumption, affirming that he frequently had sought out this one thing, namely, the elongation of the fixed stars from the moon, of the  moon from the sun, and hence the distance of the fixed stars from the sun and from the equinox point, and had always found it to be the same. ['elongation']\n",
      "So although he produced only one observation in order to demonstrate the method, it is nonetheless credible that he consulted several observations, at both the rising and the setting of the sun or moon, finally choosing the one which he saw to be intermediate among many operations that produced various positions. ['observation']\n",
      "Now this argument over 30' seems to be irrelevant to Mars's mean  motion, if indeed on these four occasions Mars, as it was observed with respect to the fixed stars, can be referred to them, without consideration of the equinox point, whose distance is uncertain. ['observed']\n",
      "17 above to investigate the position of the aphelion in Ptolemy's times. ['aphelion']\n",
      "We are nevertheless hindered in this respect, that the observed positions of Mars are to be referred to a point opposite the sun's apparent position. ['observed']\n",
      "If, at the moment taken as the true opposition of the bodies, the planet should appear to be 30' beyond the sun's true positions, the planet still has some involvement with the second inequality, and is not yet ready for an enquiry into the first inequality. ['opposition']\n",
      "And at apogee, these 30' in the equation of the orb occupy a large arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even larger portion of the time or the mean motion. ['apogee']\n",
      "At perigee the opposite takes place. ['perigee']\n",
      "For this equation of the center occupies a small arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even smaller portion of the mean motion. ['eccentric']\n",
      "Therefore, anyone who says that on these four occasions Mars was observed 30' farther along on the zodiac, says in effect that at the equinoctial point Mars's mean motion was many minutes farther back at apogee, and a few minutes back at perigee. ['observed']\n",
      "And since the arc on the eccentric is smaller than this 30' arc resulting from faulty observation, neither Mars's eccentric position nor even its sidereal position are as far forward as Mars itself appears to have moved with respect to the fixed stars, the difference being that quantity by which the arc on the eccentric differs from the 30' arc in the observation. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And since this arc is large at aphelion, differing but little from the 30' arc in the observation, and the  opposite at perigee, it therefore finally will follow that at aphelion a small amount, and at perihelion more, must be subtracted from Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars, if we accept that the fixed stars are 30' farther forward on the zodiac. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Thus not only is the mean motion made smaller (although by a much smaller quantity than the 30' resulting from faulty observation), but also the arrangement of the three acronychal observations used by Ptolemy is disturbed, whence must arise another aphelion and another eccentricity. ['observation']\n",
      "Since we have encountered three forks in the road, one concerning the sun's eccentricity, another concerning the position of the sun's apogee, and the third concerning the zodiacal positions of the fixed stars and of Mars, there are therefore eight ways of establishing the mean motions and the aphelion at the moments of observation, even if, ignoring the zodiac, we compute only with reference to the fixed stars. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Since the positions of the sun's mean motion were 21° 0' Sagittarius, 28° 50' Aquarius, and 2° 34' Gemini, and the sun's apogee was 5° 30' Gemini, the apparent positions of the sun were 21° 40' Sagittarius, 1° 13' Pisces, and 2° 41' Gemini, all three beyond opposition ^10. ['apogee']\n",
      "The true opposition therefore precede them. ['opposition']\n",
      "And since the diurnal motion at 21° Gemini (Cancer, today) is about 23', and that of the sun, 61', and the sum is 1° 24', those 41' therefore require 8 hours,11 at which time Mars was visible at 21° 8' Gemini, opposite the sun's apparent position. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Likewise, at 29° Leo (Virgo, today) Mars's diurnal motion is usually taken to be 24', the sun's diurnal motion 59', and the sum 1° 23'. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Finally, at 3° Gemini (Cancer, today) Mars's diurnal motion is 23', the sun's 57', the sum 1° 20', by which it is shown that for 7' there are required 2h 6m, at which time Mars was visible at 2° 36' Sagittarius. ['diurnal']\n",
      "To the first interval there corresponds a mean sidereal motion of 80° 57' 14\" beyond the complete cycles, and to the second, 96° 16' 24\". ['interval']\n",
      "But in the former instance the apparent motion of Mars was 68° 21' 20\" beyond the complete cycles, with precession over the interval subtracted, in the amount that it was at that time ^15. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "In the latter instance, the apparent motion was 93° 2' 20\". ['apparent motion']\n",
      "Now let the hypothesis previously under investigation, established on the basis of the most recent observations, be brought in, and let the question be raised, at what anomalistic position do the apparent motions on the eccentric correspond to the mean motions, as I have just now given them? ['eccentric']\n",
      "After a few  trials, this is found: If for the last time the aphelion of Mars is placed at 0° 41' Leo, and for the remaining times somewhat before that, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, while at the first time the mean anomaly is 46° 37', at the second, 34° 21', and the third, 130° 37½’; and thus the elongation from the equinox at the middle time was 5s 4° 59' 20\", then by the modern hypothesis of the equations the star Mars is placed at 21° 7' Gemini for the first time, 29° [31']16 Leo for the second, and 2° 37½' Sagittarius for the third, fortuitously precise. ['aphelion']\n",
      "For with three solar oppositions it is handled easily ^17. ['solar']\n",
      "Compare this aphelion with Ch. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Second, the Ptolemaic equation and apogee being retained, let 30 minutes be added to the fixed stars. ['apogee']\n",
      "For since Mars is half a degree beyond opposition to the sun, the corrected opposition will follow. ['opposition']\n",
      "The sums of the diurnal motions were 1° 24', 1° 23', and 1° 20'. ['diurnal']\n",
      "To this there corresponds 8½’ of Mars's apparent motion, which is to be subtracted from these 30'. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "Thus the distribution of the mean anomaly among these observations, which was just now found, will also be the same. ['mean anomaly']\n",
      "Only the aphelion will be transposed by the same number of minutes, so that on the last date it is at 1° 2½’ Leo. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Third, the sun's apogee being transposed by 11 or 12 degrees,18 while the longitude and equation of the fixed stars remains the same. ['apogee']\n",
      "Therefore, the first opposition will be 4 hours later,20 and Mars will be the same number of minutes farther back in position, while the last opposition will occur 4⅓ hours earlier,21 with Mars the same number of minutes farther along in position. ['opposition']\n",
      "The first interval of time becomes smaller. ['interval']\n",
      "The second interval of time again becomes smaller. ['interval']\n",
      "So, since to the two mean motions, both smaller, there corresponds a greater apparent motion than before, and on the supposition that the mean anomaly is the same as before for both, the apparent motion is greater by about 9', it therefore appears that Mars has to move down from aphelion. ['apparent motion']\n",
      "However, the first interval is unchanged unless a great descent is made, while the second [is corrected] by a descent of about 36’ ^24. ['interval']\n",
      "Therefore, if we were to indulge in our enquiry, and not take the modern hypothesis as given, we would arrive at a completely different hypothesis with a new eccentricity ^25. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And if, on the other hand, these three observations of Ptolemy were perfectly certain, this would constitute the basis for an argument that he established the sun's apogee correctly. ['apogee']\n",
      "But when 36' are subtracted from Mars's aphelion, placing it at 0° 3' Leo26 for the last time, and when its mean motion is so adjusted that for the middle time the [mean] anomaly is 34° 58½’ with longitude from the equinoctial of 5s 5° 0' 50\", the following observations result:27 ['aphelion']\n",
      "So, whether the sun's apogee is known correctly or not, the distance of the mean motion from the equinoctial is certain within 1½’. ['apogee']\n",
      "Fourth, the same things will be changed in the computed positions of the second case, and in establishing the mean longitude, that is, by transposing the apogee and the fixed stars ^28. ['longitude']\n",
      "Fifth, the sun's apogee and the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars remaining the same, the modern solar eccentricity is used. ['apogee']\n",
      "Thus, while the first and last positions of the sun remain almost exactly the same, the sun's apparent position will be changed in the middle observation by 20'. ['observation']\n",
      "For the former fall near the sun's apsides, where the equation is small, while the latter is near the middle longitude, where the equation caused by the eccentricity is maximum. ['apsides']\n",
      "The correct and truest opposition therefore follows by 4 hours ^29. ['opposition']\n",
      "The earlier time interval and its mean motion is increased, and the apparent motion is decreased, while the later time interval is decreased, and the apparent motion is increased. ['interval']\n",
      "For to move the planet forward a smaller distance in a greater time near apogee, and a greater distance in a smaller time near perigee, nothing can suffice but to increase the  eccentricity. ['apogee']\n",
      "To eliminate this, the aphelion ought to remain in about the same place, but the mean motion should omit 3½’. ['aphelion']\n",
      "Sixth, the same change of the second case will occur, if we at once change both the sun's eccentricity and the longitude of the fixed stars. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Seventh, if on the other hand we at once change both the eccentricity and apogee of the sun, combining the third and fifth cases, the fundamentals will be these ^33. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "The first interval remains the same as in the first case, while the last is much altered. ['interval']\n",
      "And because more of the path is traversed in a smaller time, it must descend farther down towards perigee. ['perigee']\n",
      "The total is thus 18½ , which we shall make up if we move the aphelion back by 1° 12', putting it at 29° 29' Cancer for the last time, with a mean anomaly of 131° 45' ^36. ['aphelion']\n",
      "It is therefore apparent that the epoch of the mean motion with respect to the equinox and the fixed stars is not much changed by an alteration in the sun's eccentricity, or in the apogee, or in both at once, but that it is only changed when the positions of the fixed stars are altered. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But what if we make something suitable by combining the second and  fifth cases, by which we can hold simply to the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars, eliminating any need for us to suspect that there might be two epochs of Mars's mean motion? ['longitude']\n",
      "For Ptolemy explicitly affirms that in his observation he found the moon's distance from the sun to be 92° 8’, the same amount he computed from his hypothesis of the moon's motions. ['observation']\n",
      "If the sun had been at 3° 5' Pisces,41 where Ptolemy placed it using his eccentricity, the moon could not have appeared 92° 8' from it, the measure that is just and computed from the hypothesis, for the reason that the setting sun reaches the eye by refraction, and appears higher than it actually is (and thus 30’ farther to the east). ['eccentricity']\n",
      "But because the arc from the moon to the sun was observed to be 92° 8’, and because of refraction, this was in actual fact 92° 38’, the sun was therefore not at 3° 3' Pisces, but at 2° 33' Pisces. ['observed']\n",
      "And this is in agreement with the fifth case, where we said that Ptolemy's maximum additive equation (which occurs at 5° Pisces) becomes 20' smaller when today's eccentricity is used, thus putting the sun at 2° 43' Pisces instead of 3° 3' Pisces. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "And so, on the supposition that refraction is universal throughout all places and times, as is discussed in the Optics,42 and supposing this observation to stand, we arrive at the conclusion that the sun's eccentricity is less than that reckoned by Ptolemy. ['refraction']\n",
      "It should not trouble you that I spoke of a refraction of 30', while this diminution is but 20'. ['refraction']\n",
      "For if you consider well, since 30° Taurus had culminated, 1° Pisces was then setting at Alexandria, and the sun, being at 3° Pisces, consequently had an altitude of two degrees, or perhaps even more, and therefore the refraction was less than 30'; nor was all the refraction simply longitudinal. ['altitude']\n",
      "For example, Ptolemy comes up with an interval of 54° 10' between Cor Leonis and Spica Virginis, although in the heavens themselves it is not more than 53° 59'. ['interval']\n",
      "But in that year, Cor Leonis had a longitude of 2° 30' Leo, that is, 4s 2° 30' 0\". ['longitude']\n",
      "The motion of the aphelion will come out a little different from what it was above in Ch. ['aphelion']\n",
      "over an interval of 1460 Julian years, which makes an annual motion of a little greater than 16\". ['interval']\n",
      "Therefore, the root of the Christian era, at noon on January 1, has this aphelion 2° 27' before Cor Leonis. ['aphelion']\n",
      "But the longitude of Cor Leonis was found to be 2° 30' Leo. ['longitude']\n",
      "Similarly, the progression of the sun's apogee is found to be 8° 23’, and at the root of the Christian era it was 1s 27° 48’ 0\" before Cor Leonis ^49. ['apogee']\n",
      "Consideration of the remaining two Ptolemaic observations, in order to investigate the latitude and ratio of the orbs at the time of Ptolemy ['latitude']\n",
      "This may be seen in the presentation of the method for investigating the ratio of the orbs, where he uses a single observation that is within three days of the opposition. ['observation']\n",
      "Add the motion of the three days and one hour, near apogee, which is 2° 53' 40\" from modern experience. ['apogee']\n",
      "This makes it 5° 29' 40\" Gemini, and let the present distance of the apogee be used, 101,800. ['apogee']\n",
      "Therefore, the point opposite the sun and Mars's eccentric position differ by 1° 5' 6\". ['eccentric']\n",
      "If, however, we use the Ptolemaic eccentricity of the sun, the sun's motion over the three days will be 1' smaller, and the sun will be at 5° 28' 40\" Gemini. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "You should also note that if we have erred by two minutes in the eccentric position, we shall now err by seven minutes in the observed position. ['eccentric']\n",
      "For let Mars be moved back to 4° 22' Sagittarius on the eccentric: it will now appear at 1° 36' Sagittarius. ['eccentric']\n",
      "And because at such proximity to opposition a difference in the eccentricity  has little effect, let us also consult the more ancient observation ^5. ['opposition']\n",
      "For since at Alexandria, the sun at 25° Capricorn rises at 7h, and the morning observation of Mars was made one hour earlier, as dawn was breaking, it was therefore made at the sixth hour, which is the fourth hour at Hven, from which time there are eight hours until noon. ['observation']\n",
      "From this time interval, by the principles laid down above, the sun's mean motion is found to have gone 5s 25° 32' 50\" beyond Cor Leonis,7 with an anomaly of 234° 54' 34\" . ['interval']\n",
      "Also, since the aphelion is 3° 40' 20\" before Cor, Mars's anomaly will be 69° 47' 32\", the equated anomaly 60° 15' 27\", and the distance 158,320. ['aphelion']\n",
      "The first is through the Ptolemaic eccentricity and equation. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Then the sun's elongation from Cor Leonis is 5s 27° 33' 20\",8 differing from Mars's eccentric longitude of 1s 26° 35' 7\" by 4s 0° 58' 13\". ['elongation']\n",
      "This arc length, and the distances of the earth and Mars from the sun, show an apparent elongation from the sun of 82° 43' 46\". ['elongation']\n",
      "Thus the apparent elongation of Mars from Cor Leonis is 3s 4° 49' 34\" ^9. ['elongation']\n",
      "And the second path is through the Brahean eccentricity and equations, if they are assumed to have been the same then as well. ['eccentricity']\n",
      "Thus the angle of commutation is 4s 0° 40' 37\". ['commutation']\n",
      "Through this, together with our value for the sun's distance from earth, as if it too were the same then, Mars's apparent elongation from Cor Leonis is shown as 3s 4° 51' 28\" ^11. ['elongation']\n",
      "Mars was observed as if placed upon or fitted to the northern star in the brow of Scorpius,12 ['observed']\n",
      "as the description of the observation proclaims? ['observation']\n",
      "For Ptolemy, Cor Leonis is at 2° 30' Leo, and the Northern Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is at 6° 20' Scorpio, at an elongation of 3s 3° 50' 0\". ['elongation']\n",
      "The elongation is 3s 3° 20' 0\" ^13. ['elongation']\n",
      "But Mars's elongation was just computed to be 3s 4° 51' 28\". ['elongation']\n",
      "Since he had confidence in this observation, it being the most ancient of those upon which he could have depended, Ptolemy doubtless established that ratio of the orbs which we have hitherto discovered in his numbers, and which this observation appeared to require. ['observation']\n",
      "Now because he pretends to investigate this ratio using an observation three days from opposition, he made different things seem to be deduced from different phenomena. ['observation']\n",
      "And so since the ancient observation was to be reserved for investigating the mean motions, he substituted the other one for finding the ratio of the orbs, which had already been found using the ancient one. ['observation']\n",
      "As was just said, it is absurd to test the ratio of the orbs using an observation as close to opposition as the one by which Ptolemy pretends to have demonstrated this ratio. ['observation']\n",
      "Let no one therefore wonder at our differing by a degree and a half from the observation that Ptolemy summoned from antiquity: let him rather examine Ptolemy's ratio of the orbs, so different from those proven by present day observations, and consider that in order to keep this observation, Ptolemy corrupted the ratio of his orbs. ['observation']\n",
      "As for the observation itself, of which this is the verbal description: ἑῳος ὁ τοῦ Ἀρέως ἐδόκει προστεθεικέναι τῷ βορείῳ μετώπῳ τοῦ σκορπίου· (In the morning, the [star] of Mars appeared to have just come upon the northern brow of Scorpius),14 I believe that an error was committed by Ptolemy, who understood the first star of Scorpius, while the observer nodded towards the fifth ^15. ['observation']\n",
      "The remaining three are of fourth, or, by my estimate, third magnitude, and one is higher than the three bright ones, and farther north. ['north']\n",
      "Now if the observer called the \"Bright Star in the Brow\" (which Brahe correctly pronounces to be of second magnitude, and which Ptolemy understood to be the intended star) the \"Northern Brow\", did he not speak ambiguously in saying simply \"northern\" rather than \"brightest of the northern\", since the star was not the northernmost? ['star']\n",
      "Furthermore, my computed longitude of Mars agrees with this, and not with the Bright Star of the Brow; and this while the hypothesis remains valid which the modern Brahean observations have generated. ['longitude']\n",
      "For Brahe places the northernmost star at 29° 3½’ Scorpio. ['star']\n",
      "The difference will be its elongation from Cor, 94° 46½’. ['elongation']\n",
      "But our calculation puts Mars at an elongation of 94° 49½' or 94° 51½' from Cor Leonis ^16. ['elongation']\n",
      "I do not deny that the latitude presents a difficulty for me, in that I  interpret the words, ἐδόκει προστεθεικέναι, as if he said, \"It appeared to approach so near that the two stars could be taken as if they were one, that they appeared to touch one another.\" ['latitude']\n",
      "Whether Mars ran beneath it centrally, or grazed its northern or southern margin, it could not have been removed from the star latitudinally by any great distance. ['star']\n",
      "For indeed, the latitudes are less uncertain than the longitudes, since the manner of their variation is simpler and more consistent, as is proven in this book. ['longitudes']\n",
      "We now know that the node retrogresses with respect to the fixed stars, by 4° 15' during one \"year of the Dog,\"18 as was proven in Ch. ['node']\n",
      "For us, over the intervening 410 years, it had retrogressed one degree, so that at the time of observation it would be 2½° before Cor Leonis. ['observation']\n",
      "Therefore, the node is 87½° past Cor Leonis. ['node']\n",
      "Therefore, it is 31° from the node, making the inclination 57½’, which, by the parallax of the orb, results in a true latitude of 1° 7' ^19. ['node']\n",
      "But now it is clear from Brahe that the  latitude of the Bright Star of the Brow is 1° 5', while that of the Northernmost Star of the Brow is 1° 42'. ['latitude']\n",
      "So the latitude appeared to refute me concerning the Bright Star of the Brow, leading me to believe that this star was occulted by Mars, and not the other. ['latitude']\n",
      "For in the latitude of the Northernmost Star of the Brow Brahe and Ptolemy are in agreement, the former pronouncing it to be 1° 46', and the latter, 1° 42'. ['latitude']\n",
      "In the latitude of the Bright one they differ. ['latitude']\n",
      "For the latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same amount, since the ecliptic has been transposed and the declinations of the degrees of the ecliptic have been altered by the same amount, as Brahe proved and as we have said in Ch. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Thus if it is true—and it is very true—that the latitude of the Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is 1° 5' today, at the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus it was no less than 1° 20', probably greater. ['latitude']\n",
      "And so Mars has a smaller northern latitude than either of the stars mentioned, and passed beneath both. ['latitude']\n",
      "For it is certain that even if we are too high by a whole degree in [the position of] the node, the latitude in the calculation was wrong by no more than three minutes. ['node']\n",
      "64 to be entirely uncertain whether the northern latitude for Mars was also once greater in the southern signs. ['latitude']\n",
      "It can only be explained as denoting the stars' being placed side by side in the same longitude; and on this ground, the one that I favor is just as good a candidate as the Bright, its greater latitude notwithstanding. ['longitude']\n",
      "This interpretation is furthered by the observer's having said \"northern brow\" rather than \"northern star of the brow\", since he is denoting, not one single star, but an entire part of the constellation. ['star']\n",
      "So these two ancient observations are of no use to us in estimating either the latitude or the ratio of the orbs at that time. ['latitude']\n",
      "The longitudes are given in geocentric ecliptic coordinates. ['longitudes']\n",
      "Longitudes are given in geocentric ecliptic coordinates; dates are in old style. ['ecliptic']\n",
      "Kepler computed the diurnal latitudinal parallax of Mars to be 3' 28\", from which he determined the latitude of Mars without parallax to be 2° 25'. ['diurnal']\n",
      "Since Mars's distance from the nonagesimal was 56° and its ecliptic latitude 2° 25', Kepler computed the value of the diurnal longitudinal parallax (i.e., the difference between Mars's distance from the nonagesimal and its ecliptic longitude) to be 3' 32\" ^6. ['nonagesimal']\n",
      "Kepler's computations for the latitudinal and longitudinal parallax resulted in positions for Mars's ecliptic longitude of 198° 21' 30\" (18° 21' 30\" Libra), and its latitude 2° 21' 30\". ['longitudinal']\n",
      "The longitude of the true Sun was at 19° 20' 8' Aries (Figure 2A). ['longitude']\n",
      "The deviation of elongation between Mars and the Sun was 58' 38\". ['elongation']\n",
      "Kepler determined the diurnal motions of the Sun and Mars to be 58' 38\" and 22' 36\" respectively, and the sum of the diurnal motions was 1° 21' 14\". ['diurnal']\n",
      "With the sum of the diurnal motions of Mars and the Sun (1° 21' 14\"), Kepler computed the time it takes for Mars and the Sun to move 58' 38\", that is, about 17 hours 20 minutes. ['diurnal']\n",
      "The longitudes of Mars and Earth's in reference to the center of the Sun are 198° 21' 30\" and 199° 20' 8\" respectively. ['longitudes']\n",
      "The deviation of elongation between Mars and the Earth remain 58' 38\". ['elongation']\n",
      "To find the position of Mars at opposition, Kepler computed the angular distance that Mars and Earth—now substituting the place of the Sun—moved during 17 hours 20 minutes; Mars moved eastward about 16' 20\" and the Sun westward about 42' 18\". ['opposition']\n",
      "Accordingly, Kepler determined the longitude of Mars at opposition to be 198° 37' 50\" from which he subtracted about 39\" in order to correct Mars's orbit; he got 198° 37' 10\" (18° 37' 10\" Libra). ['longitude']\n",
      "The Sun moved westward and its longitude decreased from the time of observation to its position opposite to Mars. ['longitude']\n",

Now let some time have passed from when the planet was at B, and let its measure be CDE, the angle on the epicycle, in order that as the aphelion of the epicycle B is translated to C, and the center of the epicycle G to D, the planet will have moved on the epicycle from C to E.
