       "<h3>Results:</h3><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at δ, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from ρθο to πβξ, we must proceed as follows. Since γ is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line γει indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric εο, it will at that moment be at ε with equation δεγ, but if it is traversing ιξ, it will be at ι with no equation, since the line of apparent motion αι coincides with the line of mean motion γι. Again, after a certain amount of time, whose measure shall be ιγζ or εγκ, whose vertical angle is δγα, just found to be 5° 27’ 47”, let a common moment be taken, represented by γκζ. At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric εo will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing ιξ will be at ζ with equation γζα. Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from γ, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at γ, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at ζ. But since in the present <b>model</b> the observer is placed at δ by the practitioners4 and at α by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at δ. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around οξ and ρπ). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at δ (just as it vanishes at ζκ and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below ξ and above ρ. Third, it must be close to δ (just as it is closer above ρ than below ξ, because the center of the other eccentric β lies off to the right of δ). If we construct a right angle to point γ of the line γδ, this perpendicular from γ to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let σφ be drawn through γ perpendicular to δγ, intersecting the eccentric about θ at σ and υ, and the other at τ and φ, and to this let the perpendicular βχ be dropped. Therefore, at the moment γσ the planet will be at σ and τ, and at the moment γφ, at υ and φ. First of all, the quantity υφ must be found. Let θυ and βφ be joined. In θυγ, θυ is given as 100,000, because θ is the center of the eccentric υ. The magnitude θγ is 7411, and θγυ is right. Therefore, γυ is 99,725. The same is to be done in βγφ. But first, βχ5 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle βγχ, in which βχ is parallel to θγ, the angle at χ is right, and γβχ is equal to θγβ (5° 27’ 47”) and βγ is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: γχ 644, βχ 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle βχφ, since βφ is 100,000 (β being the center of the eccentric φ) and χβ is 6732, χφ will be 99,773. Add χγ, 644, and γφ is given, 100,417. But γυ was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, υφ, is 692.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  It is thus established that when a planet's path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged. This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about δ, and how much this newly established hypothesis at δ will be at variance with the appearances as seen at α. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from γ to the line δβ, and βμ be made equal to βγ, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at η rather than ι. This changes what cannot be changed in the planet’s path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observer’s viewpoint. Even though the planet would traverse the same path ιη in twenty days (which path appears greater at α and smaller at δ), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between ι and η. In particular, for the observer at α the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at δ, you will prevent the planet’s being slowest at ι; that is, if you transfer the equant from γ to μ. For if you draw a straight line through γμ to the point ν on the circumference and connect αν, this equation ανμ alone will be equal to the prior, ανγ. Above ν the equations about μ will be smaller, and below ν, greater. For example, at η the angle μνα is much less than γηα. But then what we proposed to do has not been done, for the prior form of hypothesis has not yet been quite established. For αβ is not to βγ as δβ is to βμ, since βμ is equal to βγ, while δβ is greater than αβ. But if, on the other hand, you make δβ be to βμ as αβ is to βγ, βμ will become greater than βγ. Whence it follows that for the observer at α, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity. Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness. It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from δ through the center of the eccentric β. And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point γ, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  This equivalence pertains chiefly to the first inequality—that is, to the appearances at δ, close to the center of the eccentric. However, in the second inequality (the equation for the annual orb), it makes a big difference whether the planet goes around on ξπ or oρ, as was also noted above in the other equivalence. And there we could not ignore the 246 units (the difference between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican hypotheses). Much less can we overlook these 880 units, which are 1344 of the old units. In the next chapter we shall see how much of a difference in Mars’s apparent position this would occasion. Hitherto, we have transposed the observer from δ to α. Let it now be demonstrated that very nearly the same things happen if the observer remains fixed while the point of the equant is transposed. This we do to make it clear that the same thing can be done in this chapter with an eccentric that has an equant as could be done on a simple eccentric (at the end of Chapter 3 above). In the earlier case, the result was the same whether the observer or the center of the eccentric were transposed, while here, likewise, the result is almost the same whether the observer or the center of the equant be transposed. However, it necessary to adapt this demonstration to this divergence , on account of the great dissimilarity of the opinions followed by the practitioners in demonstrating the second inequality of the planets, which opinions will be keeping us in court in the next chapter. Let the points α and δ merge into one, so that the observer remain in the same place. Let δ, θ, and γ remain the same, but let the line γβα of the previous diagram be deleted, and replaced by ΑΒΓ parallel to it and passing through the point δ or Α. Let the segments ΑΒ, ΑΓ be equal to the previous segments αβ, αγ. Therefore, Γγ will be the transposition of the equalizing point γ, equal to the previous transposition of the observer αδ. Once more, two eccentrics or planetary paths through the aethereal air will be described, about Β and θ. All the letters on each circle will be carried over along with them, and the magnitudes of the lines will remain precisely the same. The only difference is that the two points on the two eccentrics at which the planet is to be placed at a given moment are no longer determined by a single line, but by parallel lines drawn from the two equant points Γ, γ, each extended to its own eccentric. For example, when the eccentric θκ has its planet at κ, the eccentric ΒΙ will have it at Ζ, where γκ and ΓΖ are parallel. And when the former has the planet at ε, the latter will have it at Ι, where γε and ΓΙ are again parallel. The rest is clear from the diagram without demonstration.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  Now, suppose it is not permissible to shift the observer (and it is not permitted by those who make the earth the center of the world, as will be remarked in the next chapter), and that the planet has been observed in several positions on the zodiac, always at opposition to the sun's mean position, and that the practitioner will use the positions and the intervals of time between them to construct this sort of hypothesis, with the observer at δ, δθ the eccentricity of the eccentric θκ, θγ the eccentricity of the equant, and κ the apogee. Comes now Kepler, who would change the observed positions and times; that is, he would observe the moments and points at which the planet is at opposition to the apparent position of the sun rather than its mean position. From these positions and times he will have come up with another hypothesis, in which the observer would be left unmoved at δ or Α, but where the eccentricity would come out to be ΑΒ in a new eccentric ΒΙ, and the eccentricity ΑΓ of a new equant Γ, and there would be a new apogee Ι. The question now is whether, if the prior practitioner combines the new eccentric ΒΙ with his original equalizing point γ, the computed equation and sidereal position of the planet will turn out much different from what he had formerly found using his eccentric γκ. (It is the first inequality that is in question; this discussion is not concerned with the second inequality, and the nature and magnitude of the changes which this procedure would effect therein.) The answer, arising from the equivalence of transpositions, is that the discrepancy will be extremely small. Its maximum, reached in the neighborhood of the points υ and Φ, will not exceed five minutes, exactly as before when the observer was transposed, except that now the line υΦ is closer to the observer δ than is its endpoint υ. Consequently, the angle υδΦ, which previously was 4’ 24”, is now 4’ 43”. The opposite happens at σΤ.</p><hr><p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:110%;\">  We shall now make use of numbers belonging to the motion of Mars. Although Ptolemy made CB and BA equal, Copernicus, freed from this rule, nonetheless also adopted other ratios, which Tycho Brahe undertook to imitate. Let CB be 7560, BA 12,600, where BE is 100,000; and, first, let DCE be 45°, whose sine is 70,711. Therefore, as 100,000 is to 70,711, so is 7560 to 5346, the sine of the arc of 3° 4' 52\", which is CEB. Subtracting this from 45° leaves CBE, 41° 55' 8\", whose half is 20° 57' 34\", the tangent to which arc is 38,304. And since EB is 100,000, while BA is 12,600, the difference, 87,400, multiplied by the radius and divided by the sum, 112,600, gives 77,620. Multiply this by the tangent found above (38,304). The product, that is, 29,732, is the tangent of the arc 16° 33' 30\", which, subtracted from the half of CBE, found above, leaves 4° 24' 4\", which is the angle BEA. Therefore, the whole, CEA, is 7° 28' 56\", in the Ptolemaic form. In the Copernican form, although the ordinary means of finding the equation is clearly presented in Tycho's lunar tables in Vol. I of the Progymnasmata, and in Copernicus himself, let me nonetheless follow a different, less usual procedure, which is adapted to an anomaly of 45°. Let βαλ be 45°, and λν or βγ be 16,380, γε or νο be 3780, and ονλ be right, that is, twice βαλ. Now let νλ be parallel to βα, and let νλ and δα be extended, so as to meet at μ. From ο let οξ be dropped parallel to νμ. Therefore, λαμ is 45°, and consequently αμ, and also μλ, are 70,711. Add λν, 16,380, and μν or οξ will be 87,091. And because γε, νο, and ξμ are equal, subtract ξμ from αμ. The remainder, αξ, is 66,931. Therefore, as οξ is to ξα, so is the whole sine4 to the tangent of αοξ or οαβ, 76,852, giving an angle of 37° 32' 37\", which differs from the arc 45° by 7° 27' 23\". Therefore, the difference between the Copernican and the Ptolemaic equations at this position is 1' 33\", a very small difference indeed.</p><hr>"
