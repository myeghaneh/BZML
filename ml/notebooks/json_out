{"sents": {"0": "Chapter 1", "1": "On the distinction between the first motion and the second or proper motions; and in the proper motions, between the first and the second inequality.", "2": "The testimony of the ages confirms that the motions of the planets are orbicular.", "3": "Reason, having borrowed from experience, immediately presumes this: that their gyrations are perfect circles.", "4": "For among figures it is circles, and among bodies the heavens, that are considered the most perfect.", "5": "However, when experience seems to teach something different to those who pay careful attention, namely, that the planets deviate from a simple circular path, it gives rise to a powerful sense of wonder, which at length drives people to look into causes.", "6": "It is just this from which astronomy arose among humans.", "7": "Astronomy's aim is considered to be to show why the stars' motions appear to be irregular on earth, despite their being exceedingly well ordered in heaven, and to investigate the specific circles whereby the stars may be moved, so that by their aid the positions and appearances of those stars at any given time may be predicted.", "8": "Before the distinction between the first motion(1) and the second motions(2) was established, people noted (in contemplating the sun, moon and stars) that their diurnal paths were visually very nearly equivalent to circles.", "9": "These were, however, entwined one upon another like yarn on a ball, and the circles were for the most part smaller(3) circles of the sphere, rarely the greatest(4) (such", "10": "as here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south.", "11": "They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion.", "12": "The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I).", "13": "The sun (on ABE) is slower, as on the following day it stands at E and so its setting follows that of the fixed stars at I with which on the previous day it was conjoined on HA.", "14": "Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG).", "15": "Hence the Pythagoreans, when they shared out musical tones among the stars, gave the lowest (the hypate among the strings of the lyre)1 to the moon, because the motions of both were slowest.", "16": "Hence have originated the words \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f79\u03c2 ^2.", "17": "The former of these terms originally corresponded to a star which, on the next day, comes to its setting earlier (the sun E is said to be \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u1f7b\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 with respect to the moon G).", "18": "The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I).", "19": "For more on this subject see our Optics, Ch.", "20": "10.", "21": "3", "22": "This first adumbration of astronomy consists, not of the unfolding of a cause, but solely of the experience of the eyes, extremely slowly acquired.", "23": "It cannot be explained in figures or numbers, nor can it be extrapolated into the future, since it is always different from itself, to the extent that no spiral is equal to any other in increments of time, and none carries over into the next with a curvature of the same quantity.", "24": "Nevertheless, there are some people today who, riding roughshod over two thousand years' work, care, erudition, and knowledge, are trying to revive this, obtruding admiration of themselves far and wide (an attempt which has not been fruitless among the ignorant).", "25": "Those with more experience consider them with good reason to be incompetent, or (if, like that man Patricius,4 they want to be known as philosophers) to act mad with reasoning.", "26": "For it was helpful to astronomers to understand that two simple motions, the first one and the second ones, the common and the proper, are intermingled, and that from this mingling that continuous sequence of conglomerated motions follows.", "27": "And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile.", "28": "When a planet (such as the moon at G) is \"left behind\" (by the sun at E or the fixed stars at I), it is carried in consequence*  through FG more swiftly than the sun (through AE) or the fixed stars (through HI).", "29": "It, however, it appears to be 'leading' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion.", "30": "For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at P while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP.", "31": "This turned out to be of great profit in astronomy in grasping the simplicity  of the motions.", "32": "Instead of unending spirals, a new one always being added to the end of the earlier one at E or G, there remained little but the solitary circles FG and AE, and a single common motion, either of all the planets and the whole world as well in a direction opposite to the proper motions, or (with the world standing still, according to Aristarchus) of the earth's globe T around the axis QR in the same direction as the proper motions.", "33": "Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them.", "34": "For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observed\u2014less striking to the eyes\u2014because the diurnal motion was very swift.", "35": "And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals.", "36": "But now, that minute division and distribution of the star's proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously.", "37": "First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun.", "38": "For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen.", "39": "At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion.", "40": "From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5.", "41": "And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence.", "42": "If one were to bundle all this together, and were at the same time to believe that the sun really moves through the zodiac in the space of a year, as Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe believed, he would then have to grant that the circuits of the three superior planets through the aethereal space, composed as they are of several motions, are real spirals, not (as before) in the manner of balled up yarn, with spirals set side by side, but more like the shape of a pretzel,6 as in the following diagram.", "43": "This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the year 1580 until the year 1596, on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it.", "44": "These motions, continued farther, would become unintelligibly intricate, for the continuation is boundless, never returning to its previous path.", "45": "Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram.", "46": "Moreover, we are forced to ascribe similar spirals to the remaining four planets, and much more complicated ones to Venus, if the earth stands still.", "47": "Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun's motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun.", "48": "Nevertheless, both leave the spirals themselves in the heavens.", "49": "Copernicus, by attributing a single annual motion to the earth, entirely rids all the planets of these extremely intricate spirals, leading the individual planets into their respective orbits7 quite bare and very nearly circular.", "50": "In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times.", "51": "Again, however, it was noticed that these loops in each planet's spirals are unequal in different signs of the zodiac, so that in some places the planet would retrogress through a longer arc of the zodiac, at others through a shorter, and now for a longer, now for a shorter time.", "52": "Nor is the increment of brightness of a retrograde planet always the same.", "53": "Because, if one were to compute the times and distances between the midpoints of the retrogressions, neither times nor arcs would be equal, nor would any of the times answer to its arc in the same proportion.", "54": "Nevertheless, for each planet there was a certain sign of the zodiac from which, through the semicircle to the opposite sign in either direction, all those things successively increased.", "55": "From these observations it came to be understood that for any planet there are two inequalities mixed together into one, the first of which completes its cycle with the planet's return to the same sign of the zodiac, the other with the sun's return to the planet.", "56": "Now the causes and measures of these inequalities could not be investigated without separating the mixed inequalities and looking into each one by itself.", "57": "They therefore thought they should begin with the first inequality, it being more nearly constant and simple, since they saw an example of it in the sun's motion, without the interference of the other inequality.", "58": "But in order to separate the second inequality from this first one, they could not do anything but consider the planets on those nights at whose beginning they rise while the sun is setting, which thence were called \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 [acronychal, or  \"night rising\"].", "59": "For since the presence and conjunction of the sun makes them go faster than usual, and the opposition of the sun has the opposite effect, before and after these points they are surely much removed from the positions they were going to occupy through the action of the first inequality.", "60": "Therefore, at the very moments of conjunction with and opposition to the sun they are traversing those very positions that are their own.", "61": "But since they cannot be seen when in conjunction with the sun, only the opposition to the sun remains as suitable for this purpose.", "62": "But since the sun's mean and apparent motions*  are two different things, for the sun, too, is subject to the first inequality, the question is raised which of these releases the planets from the second inequality, and whether the planets should be considered when at opposition to the sun's apparent position or its mean position.", "63": "Ptolemy chose the mean motion, thinking that the difference (if any) between taking the mean sun and the apparent sun could not be perceived in the observations, but that the form of computation and of the proofs would become free from difficulty if the sun's mean motion were taken.", "64": "Copernicus and Tycho followed Ptolemy, carrying over his assumptions.", "65": "I, as you see in Ch.", "66": "15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum, instead establish the apparent position, the true body of the sun, as my reference point, and will vindicate that position with proofs in Parts 4 and 5 of this work.", "67": "But before that, I shall prove in this first part that one who substitutes the sun's apparent for its mean motion establishes a completely different orbit for the planet in the aether, whichever of the more celebrated opinions of the world he follows.", "68": "Since this proof depends upon the equivalence of hypotheses, we shall begin with this equivalence.", "69": "Chapter 2", "70": "On the first and simple equivalence, that of the eccentric and the concentric with an epicycle, and their physical causes.", "71": "And now, to begin, I take up the equivalence of hypotheses adopted to save [the appearances of] the first inequality,1 which were demonstrated by Ptolemy in Book III and by Copernicus in Book III Ch.", "72": "15.", "73": "There, an eccentric is shown to square accounts with an epicycle on a concentric, provided, that is, that the line of apsides in the eccentric and the line through the center of the epicycle and the planet on the concentric always remain parallel, and that the semidiameter of the epicycle in the latter is equal to the eccentricity in the former, while the semidiameters of eccentric and concentric are equal.", "74": "And also provided that, in the former, the planet is moved uniformly on its eccentric, so as to traverse equal arcs in equal times.", "75": "First, let A be the position of the observer and the center of the concentric BB on which is the epicycle BC, BE.", "76": "Let the arcs between two B's, or the angles BAB, be equal, and the planet be first at C, then at E and G, with the lines BE, BG parallel to BC.", "77": "Next, let \u03b2 be the center of the eccentric \u03b3\u03b6, with \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03b5 equal to AB, and let \u03b1 be the point at which the observer is, and \u03b2\u03b1 (the eccentricity) be equal to the semidiameter of the epicycle BC, BE, and parallel to them.", "78": "Also, let the arcs \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b3\u03b6, that is, the angles \u03b3\u03b2\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b2\u03b6, be equal both among themselves and to the former angles BAB.", "79": "I say that the distances AC, \u03b1\u03b3, are equal, and likewise AE to \u03b1\u03b5, AG to \u03b1\u03b7, AD to \u03b1\u03b4, AH to \u03b1\u03b8, and AF to \u03b1\u03b6; and again, that the angles EAC, \u03b5\u03b1\u03b3 are equal; and that in each instance the planet, although its motion is uniform, will appear from A, \u03b1 slow at C, \u03b3, and swift at D, \u03b4. As I said, Ptolemy demonstrated this in Book III, so there is no need for further discussion.", "80": "To geometers, the diagram speaks for itself, and others may go to Ptolemy.", "81": "As for the physical accounts of these models, there is a greater difference between the two.", "82": "That this may be very clear, it must be researched at somewhat greater depth, in one way from Peurbach2 using Aristotle's principles, and in another way from Tycho.", "83": "Ptolemy has described these circles to us in their bare form, such as geometry applied to the observations shows.", "84": "Peurbach set up a way for them to be traversed that follows Aristotle, who attempted this same thing upon the geometrical suppositions of Eudoxus and Calippus, by which they had treated their astronomy.", "85": "And while these authors used 25 orbs to demonstrate all the inequalities of the planets, Aristotle (since he believed the heavens to be filled with solid orbs)3 thought that 24 other revolving orbs had to be interposed in order to free each lower orb from the revolving effect which, on account of the contiguity of surfaces, it was going to receive from the orb above it.", "86": "So, having thus accumulated 49 orbs in all (or 53 or 55, following Calippus), he attributed to each its own mover.", "87": "Any one of these would be responsible for the perfectly uniform motion of its own orb and all inferior ones which it encompassed.", "88": "This motion would take place inside the closest surrounding superior orb, as if in a sort of place,4 and from the mover would proceed a constant determination [ratio] of both the direction in which the motion was to occur, and the swiftness with which the orb was to return to its starting position.", "89": "Moreover, since that philosopher held the motion to be eternal, he also stipulated that the movers  were eternal.", "90": "Since they created motion for an infinite time, and since Aristotle knew that nothing material could receive the form of infinity, he maintained that they are also immaterial, and separable principles, and consequently immobile.", "91": "Also, since he had constructed the world's eternity from the eternity of motion, and this duration of essence, the goodness and perfection of the whole world, was opposed to destruction, which was bad, he therefore attributed to those principles the highest perfection and the understanding thereof, and from good understanding the will to see it accomplished, lest the good not be done well.", "92": "In this way, he introduced to us separate minds which, it turned out, were gods, as the perpetual administrators of the heavens' motions.", "93": "They also bestowed a moving soul [anima motrix], more closely attached to the orbs and giving them form, so that the mind would only have to give assistance.", "94": "This was either because it seemed necessary that the mover and the moving thing have some common ground, or because the potentiality, considered in relation to the distance to be traversed, should not be infinite, just as there exists no infinite motion, but only motion through a certain space in a certain time.", "95": "They therefore transferred this potentiality for creating motion to a soul, for the meantime becoming subject to matter for the purpose of inhering in the orbs of the heavens.", "96": "Now this coupling of mind and soul is indeed quite in agreement with the detailed considerations of the astronomers, even though the philosophers' mode of argument is chiefly metaphysical.", "97": "For it is the same in humans: the moving faculty is one thing; that which makes use of the moving faculty according to the indications of the senses\u2014the Will\u2014is another.", "98": "The senses differ from the moving faculty both in the means they use and in the excellence of their structure, which in the organs of sense is more admirable than in the seats of the motive faculty.", "99": "Similarly, if we should propose these Aristotelian orbs as objects of contemplation, two things will present themselves to us: 1) the motive force, sufficient for the round orb, from whose activity and constant strength the time of revolution arises; 2) the direction in which it acts.", "100": "The former is more correctly ascribed to the animate faculty, and the latter to its intelligent or remembering nature.", "101": "Now although through this solidity of orbs all motions or celestial appearances are so provided for that nothing is left to the providence of the presiding movers, while the whole variety of motions is a consequence of the number and disposition of the orbs; an although nothing else is required but that the moving souls receive and retain their activity and be set going from the first moment of creation in whatever direction is theirs, sent forth from their prisons, as it were, into space;5 nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that there is need of the supreme mind to launch any of the planets in its own direction, as if into its fixed and proper province.", "102": "Aristotle, who knew nothing of the world's beginning and did not", "103": "believe in it, of necessity ascribed this function instead to the governors of the motions.", "104": "The followers of Aristotle, and even Scaliger,6 who professes to be a Christian, openly contend that this motion of the orbs is voluntary, and that the principle of volition for them is intellectual intuition and desire.", "105": "So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet.", "106": "Then they attributed two moving souls to these two orbs (if they should carry through with their physical considerations), both with the same amount of power, proportionally, so that they would complete their periods in the same time, although moving in opposite directions.", "107": "The other model requires two deferents (which remain motionless so long as we abide by the simplicity of the motions, mentally removing the progression of the apogees), and one orb with the thickness of the planetary body.", "108": "In this orb is a soul which drives it around with a uniform effort in that direction in which it was projected in the beginning.", "109": "Thus, if this solidity of the orbs and the other assumptions be granted, in the first model BC and BE will remain parallel, and in the second, the orb \u03b3\u03b5 will go around the center \u03b2, even though the movers in the former pay no attention to AC, nor in the latter, to \u03b2.

Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about \u03b4 be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from \u03b4. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at \u03b4 square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered.", "337": "But since it is certain that at one and the same time the planet traverses one and the same path in the heavens, not one seen to an observer at \u03b4 and another to an observer at \u03b1, it is also certain, as a consequence, that the planet cannot appear to both observers (both the one at \u03b1 and the one at \u03b4) to be equally moved in the same time.", "338": "For let \u03b9\u03b7 be a portion of the planet\u2019s true path, and let the planet traverse this in a given time, say twenty days.", "339": "Now since \u03b1 is nearer \u03b9\u03b7 than \u03b4 is, \u03b9\u03b7 will appear greater at \u03b1 than at \u03b4, by what is demonstrated in optics.", "340": "Therefore, during the same twenty days the planet will appear to make greater progress to one who is at \u03b1 than to one who is at \u03b4. And since any planet maintains a fixed and constant number of days in which it is returned to the same sidereal position, the slowness has to be compensated by a contrary speed.", "341": "Therefore, since in the portion \u03b9\u03b7 the planet appears slower to one at \u03b4, it will in some other portion appear swifter to the one at \u03b4 than to one at \u03b1. Hence it happens that it appears slowest to the one at \u03b4 in one place, and to one at \u03b1 in another.", "342": "Nevertheless,  the planet itself can be truly slowest in but one place on its orbit.", "343": "With these as preliminaries, the question is raised whether one and the same true path of the planet in the heavens (this is presupposed) can present two sets of appearances each proper to an observer, one at \u03b4 and the other at \u03b1, and each such as comply with and admit the Ptolemaic form of computation.", "344": "If the planet were of equal speed at all parts of its orbit, the answer, according to what was said in Ch.", "345": "3, is yes.", "346": "But since in terms of real and true increment of time2 the planet is slowest at one point on the eccentric and fastest at the opposite point, the answer must therefore be, clearly not.", "347": "The reason for this is that the two slowings are intermingled, one real and physical, occurring at one place on the eccentric, and the other optical and apparent and not occurring at a single place, but in the place most distant from whatever position is chosen for the observer.", "348": "Now, when the observer \u03b1 lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric \u03b2 and the center of the equant \u03b3 on the side of \u03b2 opposite the center of the equant \u03b3, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position \u03b9. But when the observer departs from this line, as at \u03b4, then a straight line drawn from \u03b4 through the center of the circle \u03b2 marks the place of the optical slowing, \u03b7, while the true and physical slowing is at \u03b9. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between \u03b9 and \u03b7, as would be if a line were to be drawn from \u03b4 through \u03b3 to the point \u03b6. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which \u03b4\u03b2 were the line of apsides of the eccentric and \u03b2\u03b3 the line of the equant\u2019s eccentricity, then even though the planet\u2019s true path \u03b9\u03b7 remained the same, it would be represented differently at \u03b4 than at \u03b1. For to the observer at \u03b4 the planet would be slowest at \u03b6, and to the one at \u03b1 it would be slowest at \u03b9. But no such thing would be represented at \u03b4 that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above.", "349": "For the forms of the hypotheses differ in that in the former, \u03b2 is the midpoint between \u03b1 and \u03b3 (as physical considerations require, if the moving power is in \u03b1), while in the latter the center of the eccentric \u03b2 would not be the midpoint between \u03b4 and \u03b3, nor would the line of the equant\u2019s eccentricity pass through the observer \u03b4, as before.", "350": "Even if it did pass through \u03b4, as \u03b4\u03b3, it would not cut the eccentric into two equal parts, because it would not cut it at the center \u03b2, and it would not allow the planet to appear on one side fastest and on the other slowest, at opposite places.", "351": "It is thus established that when a planet's path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged.", "352": "This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about \u03b4, and how much this newly established hypothesis at \u03b4 will be at variance with the appearances as seen at \u03b1. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from \u03b3 to the line \u03b4\u03b2, and \u03b2\u03bc be made equal to \u03b2\u03b3, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at \u03b7 rather than \u03b9.

But by all the arguments, even the testimony of the very hypothesis set up upon \u03b2 which I am refuting, it is fitting that this real slowing down of the planet arises from its moving away from the body of the sun, and the speeding up from its approach to the sun itself, seated at \u03ba. On the other hand, it is impossible even to conceive of how a force could inhere in point \u03b2, which has no body, rather than in k, quite nearby, in which there is the sun, the heart of the world, which force would drive the planet around more swiftly or slowly according to its approach and recess.", "511": "Furthermore, even if one who is not prepared to admit that the slowings and quickenings arise physically from the close interconnection of the eccentrics, should consequently assert that these affects of motion are naturally under the control of the motive faculties residing in the body of the planet, we will again maintain the same probable conclusion.", "512": "For what would be the reason why those", "513": "minds would bypass the point \u03ba (which has a geometrical affinity for motion, being invested with a body of no small magnitude) and pay attention to the point \u03b2, only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities)5 of the solar body distant from the sun, empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone?", "514": "Even Copernicus himself admits, in Book 5 Ch.", "515": "16, that the sun is really fixed at \u03ba, wherefore the eccentricity \u03b4\u03ba is constant, while he holds that the point \u03b2, which he takes as the center of the annual orb, is displaced over the ages, thus making \u03b2\u03b4 shorter.", "516": "Thus either \u03b2 is no longer in the center of the world today, or it was previously not there.", "517": "But it is probable either that the motion originates from the center of the world, or that the moving minds pay attention to the center of the world, and thus not to \u03b2 but to \u03ba, which Copernicus says is fixed, as the center of the world should be.", "518": "Led by these probable arguments, I concluded that the line of apsides taken in order to produce the planet\u2019s first inequality, ought to go right through \u03ba itself rather than \u03b2. But we shall obtain this result when we make use of the sidereal positions which the planet has at the moment when the sun\u2019s apparent position and its own are opposite.", "519": "And when the points \u03ba and \u03b2 are collinear with the earth \u03b3, and when the planet itself falls on the same line at the same time, as at \u03c4, it is at the same moment at opposition to both the sun\u2019s mean position and its apparent position.", "520": "Its position is the same whether it be designated by \u03b2\u03c4 or by \u03ba\u03c4 extended out to the fixed stars, and the planet is truly stripped of its second inequality, whether it depends upon the earth\u2019s apparent position or its mean position.", "521": "But when the earth comes to the side of its eccentric, or rather the middle intervals,6 a fairly large difference arises between them.", "522": "For let the earth have traveled from \u03b3 to \u03c5 (that is, let the sun, directly opposite, have moved from perigee in Capricorn to Aries), and let the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u03c5\u03b2 be found in Aries, while the line upon which the planet is observed in Libra be exactly opposite, namely, \u03c5\u03c9.", "523": "Now since \u03c5\u03ba is farther eastward beyond \u03c5\u03b2, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.", "524": "And since \u03c5 is the observer\u2019s home, the earth, and \u03c9 is the planet, and both are going down towards \u03be, the earth \u03c5 more swiftly, the line \u03c5\u03c9 will at a later time be still more inclined to the line of the  sun\u2019s visible position \u03c5\u03ba.", "525": "Therefore the apparent opposition precedes the mean.", "526": "So, at a time preceding the moment designated by \u03b2\u03c5 (call it \u03b2\u03b8), the planet will fall upon a line drawn from \u03ba through \u03b8, that is, at \u03b6. And then the planet\u2019s line of vision \u03b8\u03b6 (as the less experienced should diligently note) lies farther eastward beneath the fixed stars than the line \u03c5\u03c9 of the later time.", "527": "This is because, although \u03b8\u03b6 precedes the line \u03c5\u03c9 in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if \u03b8, \u03c5, and absolutely all points on the earth\u2019s circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars.", "528": "Therefore, it is not the distance of the endpoints \u03b8 and \u03c5 but the inclination of the lines \u03b8\u03b6 and \u03c5\u03c9 that causes the lines to strike upon different zodiacal positions, since they would be perceived as coinciding if they were parallel.", "529": "But that \u03b6 is inclined towards \u03c9 is clear from the supposition that the planet is moved from \u03b6 to \u03c9 in the same time that the earth is moved from \u03b8 to \u03c5. For the earth is swifter than the planet.", "530": "Therefore, the earth traverses a greater space \u03b8\u03c5 than does the planet along \u03b6\u03c9.", "531": "But it can be shown even more easily that at an earlier time the planet is farther east, since at opposition it is retrograde, as is clear to everyone.", "532": "It is therefore clear what is altered in the positions stripped of the second inequality, in this transition from the mean to the apparent positions of the sun.", "533": "For, at \u03c4 and the point opposite, the original positions remain; \u03b1t \u03b6 \u03bfr \u03c9 an addition is made to the observed position, since \u03b8\u03b6 (as was said) is farther eastward than \u03c5\u03c9.", "534": "A subtraction is made in the intervening time, because \u03b8\u03b6 is the line of vision at an earlier time than is \u03c5\u03c9.", "535": "At the opposite position the outcome is the contrary, that is, an addition is made to the time and a subtraction from the position.", "536": "Accordingly, these positions of the planet differ considerably from the original ones.", "537": "And therefore, the operation set up in this new way produces quite different results.", "538": "That is, since we have transferred the fictitious point of observation to the sun \u03ba (by virtue of our having viewed the planet when it was at \u03c4 and \u03b6 and the earth was on the lines \u03ba\u03c4 and \u03ba\u03b6, namely, at the points \u03b3 and \u03b8), the eccentricity will now originate at the point \u03ba. But in Ch.", "539": "5 above, it was shown that when the observer is shifted from \u03b2 to \u03ba and a line is drawn from \u03ba through the original point of uniformity \u03b4, although this new hypothesis does result in a new eccentric, it is one that, for the observer at \u03b2, leaves nearly all his appearances undisturbed.", "540": "So, by joining \u03b4\u03ba, dividing it at \u03bc so that \u03b4\u03bb is to \u03b4\u03bc as \u03b4\u03b2 is to \u03b4\u03ba, tracing out a new eccentric \u03b7\u03b5 about \u03bc equal to the previous one \u03be\u03c7, and drawing a new line of apsides through \u03ba\u03b4, a new hypothesis will be formed, whose apsis is at \u03b7. Previously, however, we had improperly called \u03c7 the apogee, because the Copernican center \u03b2 on the line \u03c7\u03b2 was the successor to the Ptolemaic position of the earth.", "541": "Now, following my own notions, we shall call \u03b7 the aphelion (since we are in the Copernican hypothesis), and the  point opposite it perihelion, because the sun\u2019s distance from \u03b7 is a maximum ^7.", "542": "It has been said how this pair of opinions, mine and those of the authorities, differ as regards physics.", "543": "It has also been shown how each is to be constructed geometrically in the Copernican form.", "544": "Third, it has been driven home that in astronomical terms those opinions8 do not differ in any important way at the moments of conjunction and opposition9.", "545": "The next thing for me to do is to demonstrate what remained unexplained in Ch.", "546": "5 above, that there is a considerable difference between the two hypotheses if you are required to use  them to compute the planet\u2019s position outside the acronychal location ^10.", "547": "If a line be drawn through the centers of the eccentrics \u03bb, \u03bc, parallel to \u03b2\u03ba, and extended to intersect each eccentric in two points, above and below, there will be set up, below, the maximum space \u03b5\u03c1 between the two, equal to \u03bb\u03bc.", "548": "But because it is lines from \u03b4, not those from \u03bb, that designate certain unchanged moments of time, which is what we need here, let \u03b4\u03c1 be drawn intersecting the eccentrics at \u03b5 and \u03c1, so that at one and the same moment the planet on one might be at \u03b5 and on the other at \u03c1. When the earth is on the line \u03b4\u03c1, at \u03c0, the planet, whether it is at \u03b5 or \u03c1, will in either case be seen at the same place on the zodiac.", "549": "For, optically considered, the line \u03b5\u03c1 appears as a point.", "550": "But when the earth departs towards either side of this line, the magnitude of the line \u03b5\u03c1 appears greater and greater, since it is viewed obliquely.", "551": "It is required to find the point on the earth\u2019s orb from which the lines of vision passing through \u03b5 and through \u03c1 are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at \u03c1 when it should have been placed at \u03b5.", "552": "First, the angle will be greater down at \u03b5 than up near \u03c4 because the earth\u2019s orbit, described about \u03b2, moves the observer nearer to \u03b5\u03c1 than to \u03c4.

places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself?", "684": "Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8?", "685": "Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s

line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4,

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality.", "688": "But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.", "689": "For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line.", "690": "Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9.", "691": "But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.", "692": "And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.", "693": "Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.", "694": "Therefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e.", "695": "Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9.", "696": "But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396.", "697": "Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.", "698": "Thus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position.", "699": "For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.", "700": "At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.", "701": "At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.", "702": "And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.", "703": "For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one.", "704": "That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller.", "705": "And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle.", "706": "Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus.", "707": "It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position.", "708": "Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel.", "709": "Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time.", "710": "Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f.", "711": "We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396.", "712": "Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396.", "713": "From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396.", "714": "Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8.", "715": "Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.", "716": "Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun.", "717": "In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394.", "718": "Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.", "719": "Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy's account) is at the other end of the line of the sun\u2019s mean position in the neighborhood of \u039a\u03a5 (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove).", "720": "Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line \u0394\u0394 drawn from \u0394 to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to \u0396\u039f or \u03a8\u039a, equal to \u0396\u039f, and very nearly equal to \u03a8\u039a, and the new \u0394 will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis.", "721": "But at the end of Ch.", "722": "5 above, it was shown that if through \u0394 a line \u0394\u0394 be drawn parallel to \u039a\u03a8, \u039a\u03a8 being equal to \u0394\u0394, and if the new \u0394 be joined to \u039a, and the new line \u039a\u0394 be cut at \u039c in the same ratio in which the previous \u039a\u0394 was cut at \u0394, then by this new hypothesis a new eccentric is constructed, that is, one having a different position from the former, which even if applied in the prior hypothesis would still leave all the appearances to an observer at \u039a very nearly undisturbed.", "723": "Let such a new eccentric be described about \u039c, equal to the former, and let \u039a\u039c be extended in both directions.", "724": "The new apogee will be \u0397, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points \u0392, \u039f, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at \u0391 and farther at \u0399 than before.", "725": "However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis.", "726": "(This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sun\u2019s eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicus\u2019s and Tycho\u2019s discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.)", "727": "The reason is not that the point of equality \u0394 does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sun\u2019s apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval \u039b\u039c.", "728": "Also, from this distance of the centers there necessarily follows an equal distance of the positions of the planetary body.", "729": "Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sun\u2019s middle distances.", "730": "For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from \u0394\u0394.", "731": "It is therefore greatest near the sun\u2019s apsides, and greater near perigee on

discovery would support observations of complete accuracy.", "825": "For it had then been demonstrated in that book that the discovery was consistent with the observations within the limits of accuracy of ordinary astronomy.", "826": "So from that time I began to think seriously of comparing observations.", "827": "In 1597, I wrote Tycho Brahe asking his opinion of my little book,3 and when he, in reply, mentioned (among other things) his own observations, he ignited in me an overwhelming desire to see them.", "828": "Moreover, Tycho, who was indeed himself a large part of my destiny, did not cease from then on to invite me to come to him.", "829": "And since I was frightened off by the distance of the place, I again ascribe it to divine arrangement that he came to Bohemia.", "830": "I thereupon came to visit him at the beginning of 1600 in hopes of learning the correct eccentricities of the planets.", "831": "But when I found out during the first week that, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, he made use of the sun\u2019s mean motion, while the apparent motion would be more in accord with my little book (as is clear from the book itself), I begged the master to allow me to make use of the observations in my own manner.", "832": "At that time, the work which his aide Christian Severinus4 had in hand was the theory of Mars.", "833": "The occasion had placed this in his hands, in that they were busy with the observation of the acronychal position or opposition of Mars to the sun in 9\u00b0 Leo.", "834": "Had Christian been treating a different planet, I would have entered upon it as well.", "835": "I therefore once again think it to have happened by divine arrangement, that I arrived at the same time in which he was intent upon Mars, from whose motions alone we will have to come to a knowledge of the hidden secrets of astronomy, or remain forever ignorant of them ^5.", "836": "A table of mean oppositions was worked out, starting with the year 1580.", "837": "A hypothesis was invented which was proclaimed to represent all these oppositions within a distance of two minutes in longitude.", "838": "(The numbers I used in Ch.", "839": "5 were taken from among these, or differed from them only slightly.)", "840": "The apogee at the beginning of the year 1585 was placed at 23\u00b0 45\u2019 Leo.", "841": "The maximum eccentricity, made up of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was 20,160, in units of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle was 16,380.", "842": "Therefore, in the Ptolemaic form of the first inequality, the eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or a little less.", "843": "From this hypothesis, a table of eccentric equations for individual degrees was constructed, as well as a table of the corrected mean motion, made by adding 1\u00be\u2019 to the mean motion of the Prutenic Tables ^6.", "844": "These mean motions, apogees, and likewise the nodes, were extended over a period of forty years, exactly as was done for the solar and lunar motions in Book I of the Progymnasmata.", "845": "It was only in the latitude at acronychal positions and also the parallax", "846": "of the annual orb that Christian got stuck.", "847": "There was, actually, a hypothesis and table for the latitudes, but they failed to elicit the observed latitude.", "848": "This result was a problem for him, as he was about to brood over the lunar motions.", "849": "Now since I suspected what proved to be true\u2014that the hypothesis was inadequate\u2014I girded myself for the work following opinions that had been preconceived and had been expressed in my Mysterium cosmographicum.", "850": "At the beginning there was great controversy between us as to whether it were possible to set up another sort of hypothesis which would express to a hair\u2019s breadth so many positions of the planet, and whether it were possible for the  former hypothesis to be false despite its having accomplished this so far over the entire circuit of the zodiac.", "851": "I consequently showed, using the arguments presented already in Part I, that an eccentric can be false, yet answer for the appearances within five minutes or better, provided that the equant point be true.", "852": "As for the parallax of the annual orb, and the latitudes, that prize was still unclaimed, and had not yet been won by the hypothesis of those others.", "853": "What remains, then, is to find  out whether they, with their computation, might not somewhere differ from the observations by five minutes.", "854": "I therefore began to investigate the certitude of their operation.", "855": "What success came of that labor, it would be boring and pointless to recount.", "856": "I shall describe only so much of that labor of four years as will pertain to our methodical enquiry.", "857": "Chapter 8", "858": "Tycho Brahe\u2019s table of observed and computed observations of Mars\u2019s oppositions to the line of the

^3.", "863": "However, the position of its apogee then fell short of the Prutenic calculation at the same time, by 5\u00b0 2\u2019, both being compared with the first star of Aries in the Copernican manner.", "864": "Hence, owing to our removal of the vernal equinox westward from that star, which was then 28\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019,4 it is concluded that Mars\u2019s apogee was at 23\u00b0 25\u2019 Leo.", "865": "For the first date it was set at 23\u00b0 20\u2019 Leo, and for the last, at 23\u00b0 45\u2019 Leo.", "866": "Also, the maximum eccentricity, composed of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was found to be 20, 160 parts, of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle, or distance between centers as given by Copernicus, is 16,380.", "867": "In both of these, however, he

another.", "874": "But they permitted this discrepancy advisedly.", "875": "This is clear from the following: since the nodes are about 17\u00b0 Taurus and Scorpio, and the limits about 17\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius, as will be said below, the additions and subtractions are made chiefly at 17\u00b0 Cancer, 25\u00b0 Virgo, 4\u00b0 Scorpio, 27\u00b0 Sagittarius, and 13\u00b0 Pisces, intermediate points, and none at 21\u00b0 Leo and 18\u00b0 Scorpio, the nodes and the limit.", "876": "They therefore had reason to believe that a planet is not divested of its second inequality unless the sun\u2019s departure from the node is as great as the planet\u2019s on its own orbit.", "877": "Their intentions, moreover, were not consistent.", "878": "For, in their way of thinking, the difference ought to be greatest at 3\u00b0 Cancer, because Cancer is closest to the 45th degree,5 where this difference is generally greatest.", "879": "But at 17\u00b0 Cancer they subtracted 5 minutes, while at 3\u00b0 Cancer, one minute only.", "880": "Because of this, the following table, comparing the positions (referred to the orbit of Mars) with the mean positions of the sun at these moments, is

follows a table of Mars\u2019s eccentric positions.", "888": "All positions are tolerably accurate except 27\u00b0 Sagittarius.", "889": "Here, for various reasons, a small but appreciable quantity has been accumulated.", "890": "First, the sun\u2019s position is 26\u00b0 45\u2019 24\u201d Gemini.", "891": "Now the computed position on Mars\u2019s orbit is 26\u00b0 24\u2019 43\u201d Sagittarius.", "892": "In the opinion of the table, 10\u2019 20\u201d are to be subtracted from the latter to refer it to the ecliptic.", "893": "Therefore, the computed position on the ecliptic would be 26\u00b0 24\u2019 13\u201d Sagittarius, a difference from opposition to the sun of 21\u2019 11\u201d.", "894": "Chapter 9", "895": "On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars.", "896": "But it is now time for us to discuss in detail this adjusting to the ecliptic or to the planet's orbit, which serves as a foundation.", "897": "First, the table provides us the following information from the observations: the northern latitude takes its rise from 18\u00b0 Taurus, at which it was five minutes, reaches its observed maximum at 21\u00b0 Leo, decreased thereafter and became only 1\u2154\u00b0 at 3\u00b0 Scorpio, but right away at 27\u00b0 Sagittarius it was south  and a rather large 4\u00b0, and still", "898": "greater at 13\u00b0 Pisces.", "899": "From this one concludes roughly that the ascending node is a little before 18\u00b0 Taurus, and the descending node far beyond 3\u00b0 Scorpio.", "900": "The nodes will therefore be around 17\u00b0 Taurus and 17\u00b0 Scorpio, and the limits around 17\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius.", "901": "Since the plane of Mars\u2019s eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit.", "902": "I use the term, \u201cobserved arcs\u201d, because here one must mentally separate out the planet\u2019s eccentricity, and proceed as though Mars\u2019s path were in the orb of the fixed stars, exactly as is the ecliptic, and as though it really intersected the latter.", "903": "And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planet\u2019s body intersects the ecliptic.", "904": "It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosius\u2019s On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planet\u2019s path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect.", "905": "And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit.", "906": "Consequently, the arc between the planet\u2019s position on its orbit and the nearest node is always greater than that between its ecliptic position and the same node.", "907": "Now when we observe the planets, we do not feel convinced that we have  defined their exact positions until we have referred them to the ecliptic.", "908": "We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found.", "909": "The ecliptic position is used, therefore, to aid our memory and comprehension.", "910": "But when, on the other hand, we compute the planet in its own hypothesis,1 we are not concerned with the ecliptic to which it is inclined, but with the exact path of the planet.", "911": "Therefore, to be able to", "912": "compare the observed position with the computed position, we must either extend the arc between the ecliptic position and the nearer node, or abridge the arc between the body of the planet and the same node, so that from the former operation the position on the orbit might be given, and from the latter, the ecliptic position.", "913": "This is actually accomplished by adding or subtracting, according as the node precedes or follows the planet\u2019s position.", "914": "Such care concerning the planets Ptolemy considered unnecessary.", "915": "Copernicus did not forego it in treating the moon, and Tycho Brahe diligently embraced it for the sake of precision.", "916": "To continue: in the referring process which we have been considering, there are two things I would like to know, both of which I can seek using the same procedure  and diagram.", "917": "Let A be the sidereal position of the node, AB the arc of the ecliptic, and upon it let AC be set equal to AB, and let the planet be observed beneath C. Further, from C let an arc be drawn perpendicular to the ecliptic, and let it be CE.", "918": "Now in the first place the ancients thought that since E is the position on the ecliptic and C the position of the orbit of the planet I, the planet is at the point opposite the sun when the sun is at E, the planet being observed at C. However, as was said above, those who constructed the tables thought that the planet is not exactly at opposition to the sun unless arc AB,", "919": "the elongation of the place opposite the sun from the same node, is made equal to AC (the observed distance of the planet from the node).", "920": "Now the truth of the matter is quite different.", "921": "The planet is, indeed, seen in opposition to the sun at that time, but it really is not, and the advantage we seek from the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun is more harmed by making AC and AB equal, than they themselves were hoping it would be corrected.", "922": "For why are the planets observed at opposition to the sun?", "923": "In order, of course, that they then lack the second inequality of longitude.", "924": "And when the point opposite the sun is at B and the planet is at C, both being between the nodes and the limits, the planet is more wrapped up in the second inequality of longitude than if the point opposite the sun were at E, the planet remaining at C. For let G be the sun, the center of the planetary system, at which all the orbs intersect the ecliptic, whether in the Copernican or the Brahean form.", "925": "Let G be joined to A and E, points on the ecliptic, and let the earth be on the line EG, at H. Let HC be joined, and from H let the sun G be observed opposite E, while from the same point H let the planet be seen at C, its sidereal position along the line HC.", "926": "Therefore, in this sighting, the planet is really on the line HC.", "927": "It is, however, far below the fixed stars.", "928": "Let it be at the point I on the line HC, and let a straight line be drawn from G through I, which will intersect the arc CE.", "929": "For the whole plane CEHG is beneath the arc EC.", "930": "Let its point of intersection be F, and let a third arc AF be drawn from A through F to BC, cutting BC at D. It is obvious that the plane of the planet\u2019s eccentric viewed from H towards C is set beneath AF, not AC, and that when the point opposite the sun is at E, the planet will really be beneath F, while when the point opposite the sun is located at B the planet is really going to be beneath D, although both do appear beneath C. But AD is shorter than the legs of the isosceles triangle BAC.", "931": "Therefore, the point B opposite the sun is farther from A than is D, the position beneath which the planet is at the moment they have chosen.", "932": "Therefore, the sun really stands beyond the point opposite the planet's true position.", "933": "This is contrary to what they proposed to do.", "934": "But it is likewise false that if the orbit of the planet were beneath AC, AB should on that account be taken equal to AC.", "935": "For the orbit\u2019s really being beneath AD is likewise not sufficient reason for taking AD equal to AB.", "936": "For since the planet is observed at the point opposite the sun in order that it might shed the second inequality of longitude, while the longitude is to be reckoned on the planet\u2019s true orbit, or on AD which stands above it, surely, unless the point opposite the sun falls upon the arc drawn through the planet at right angles to the orbit (that is, unless ADB is a right angle), the point B opposite the sun will not coincide in longitude with D. But if ADB is a right angle, AB is longer than AD.", "937": "They are therefore not equal.", "938": "Clearly, therefore, the equality between arcs AC and AB that the table aspires to is undermined.", "939": "However, for practical purposes, these differences are smaller than can be perceived.", "940": "I therefore do not hesitate to allow the place opposite the sun to be at E, with AEF right and AFE consequently acute, even though it has just been demonstrated that AFE should be right instead.", "941": "But it was also necessary to proceed against a new claim of accuracy, by means of accurate arguments.", "942": "What follows here is the harm arising from this accuracy.", "943": "In the second place, then, I wish to establish this: that in the table of adjustment they followed a procedure that is unsound.", "944": "For, given Mars\u2019s ecliptic position E and apparent latitude EC, they computed the length of AC, and stated that the planet on its orbit was then distant from the node by their quantity AC.", "945": "Now the orbit of the planet (whose first inequality we are investigating) is not beneath AC, but beneath AD, as was just shown.", "946": "Therefore, the arc AC has nothing to do with the first inequality, but adulterates the planet\u2019s true elongations from A. And furthermore, the apparent latitude is EHC, while the true latitude of the point F, the inclination of the line GF to the ecliptic, is EGF.", "947": "Thus, although the second inequality of longitude is swallowed up at opposition to the sun, the second inequality of latitude is nonetheless near its maximum there, and its measure is the angle HIG.", "948": "Therefore, just as the whole latitude EC causes AC to be longer than AE by the arc EB, similarly, the part FC or HIG of this apparent latitude, which is a result of the second inequality, makes AC longer than AF.", "949": "So it is longer than it should be.", "950": "And this error cannot be ignored, as it can be as much as 9 minutes.", "951": "This error could also have been perceived in the inconstancy of the angle BAC, which they attributed to the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars's orbit.", "952": "This is clear from the result obtained if you suppose the arc AC to be increased by the amount of the addition expressed in the table, and use this and AC to compute the angle EAC.", "953": "For the angles come out as in the accompanying table,  from which it is clear that in the northern semicircle they suppose an angle of maximum northern latitude of 4\u00b0 33\u2019, and in the southern, of 6\u00b0 26\u2019 south.", "954": "According to this, at the subtending line connecting the nodes, which passes through the sun or earth, the plane of the eccentric would somehow be bent, since the upper part is less inclined than the lower.", "955": "Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planet\u2019s eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle.", "956": "However, all this is in conflict with the simplicity of the celestial motions, as many examples from experience will attest.", "957": "Therefore, the true procedure for referring the inclinations to the orbit is this: from the planet\u2019s position E on the ecliptic, known from the observations, to find the angle of inclination EGF for that position, using the method that will follow below.", "958": "Then, since the angle E is right, from AE and EF (the measure of the angle EGF) AF is found by trigonometry, or instead of EF the constant angle  EAF may be used.", "959": "And since, from arguments which I shall present below, it is clear that for the star Mars the angle EAF is not greater than about 1\u00b0 50\u2019, the adjustment about 45\u00b0 from the node (where it is maximum) accordingly does not exceed one minute, for which the table nonetheless has one add 8 or 10 minutes in certain places.", "960": "So for this reason, too, the hypothesis can be in error by as much as 7 and 9 minutes, since the observations upon which it was founded suffered no little loss through this adjustment.", "961": "I was consequently subject to much less restraint than before in seeking out a new hypothesis.", "962": "Chapter 10", "963": "Consideration of the observations themselves, with which Tycho Brahe hunted for the moments of opposition to the mean sun.", "964": "In an enquiry of such precision, I could not have foregone a deeper inspection of the foundations themselves.", "965": "And Brahe had given me the opportunity to make use of his observations.", "966": "This is what I found.", "967": "On 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m,1 they set Mars down at 8\u00b0 36\u2019 50\u201d Gemini2 without mentioning the horizontal variations,  by which term I wish the diurnal parallaxes and the refractions to be understood in what follows.", "968": "Now this observation is distant and isolated.", "969": "It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3.", "970": "For in Maestlin,4 on the twelfth at noon, Mars is put at 8\u00b0 20\u2019 Gemini, and on the seventeenth, again at noon, it is at 6\u00b0 25\u2019 Gemini.", "971": "Therefore, the motion over five whole days would be 1\u00b0 55\u2019.", "972": "In Stadius,5 it is 1\u00b0 52\u2019.", "973": "Therefore, on the seventeenth at the same hour of 10h 50m, Mars ought to have been seen at either 6\u00b0 41\u2019 50\u201d Gemini, or 6\u00b0 44\u2019 50\u201d.", "974": "At 9h 40m (which Tycho gives as the moment of opposition), it is 1\u2019 4\u201d farther forward, at either 6\u00b0 42\u2019

makes use of a diurnal motion which is not observed but imported from elsewhere, and about which the different authors differ from one another by three minutes over these five days.", "977": "On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16\u00b0 47\u2019 Cancer by observation ^6.", "978": "The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet

planet as something which could alter its position.", "983": "Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.", "984": "On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21\u00b0 18\u2019 11\u201d Leo ^8.", "985": "The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24\u2019

17\u00b0 28\u2153\u2019 Cancer, altitude 14\u00b0 4\u2019, and thus affected by refraction.", "1072": "Therefore, from 8h 28\u00bdm in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46\u00bdm, it was

at 8h 8m the distance from the same star was 29\u00b0 13\u00bd ^9.", "1074": "Therefore, over 24h 21m it moved 25\u2019.", "1075": "And this diurnal motion remained the same on the 27th.", "1076":

rising farther to the east (because it was retrograde), parallax moved it eastward, and in the morning, when it was setting and was farther to the west, parallax moved it westward.", "1079": "So, just as the moon\u2019s diurnal parallax apparently slows its motion, the same parallax in turn quickens Mars\u2019s retrograde motion.", "1080": "Therefore, if parallax is perceived, it is perceived through an excessively enlarged diurnal motion.", "1081": "But this motion is diminished.", "1082": "Therefore, there is no parallax.", "1083": "Again, refraction is perceived as contrary to parallax.", "1084": "Now the refraction at altitude 13\u00b0 is 4\u2019 from the table of fixed stars, and 8\u2019 from the table of the sun,10 and only a very small part of this affects the longitude, as Cancer descends quite obliquely.", "1085": "So the refraction in longitude comes to three minutes at most, which, added to 9\u2154\u2019, makes the refraction-free motion 12\u2154\u2019 over 10\u00be hours, which motion, if it also were free from parallax, ought to have been 11\u00bd\u2019.", "1086": "Therefore, the excess of 1\u2153\u2019 is the longitudinal parallax for the two observations\u2014clearly minimal, untrustworthy, and entirely contemptible.", "1087": "On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23\u00b0 29\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51\u00b0.", "1088": "The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43\u00b0 58\u2019 from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15\u00b0.", "1089": "And, measured by the straight edge, Mars was perfectly collinear with the two stars.", "1090": "And so, since Mars\u2019s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars.", "1091": "This is obtained here as follows.", "1092": "On January 16 at 10\u00bdh it was 23\u00b0 27\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius.", "1093": "On January 17 at 10\u2157h 12 it was 23\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 from the same star.", "1094": "Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14\u00bd\u2019.", "1095": "Now in order to comply with Brahe\u2019s advice, we must set out the distance between the foot of Erichthonius and Cor Leonis, which is found to be 67\u00b0 21\u2019.", "1096": "Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23\u00b0 29\u2019, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43\u00b0 52\u2019, at 7\u00bdh in the evening, which at 5h in the morning was 43\u00b0 58\u2019, 6 minutes greater.", "1097": "The time interval is 9\u00bd hours, to which ought to correspond 5\u215d\u2019 of the diurnal motion.", "1098": "Here, therefore, the  sum of the two parallaxes is no more than \u215c\u2019 except that the amount of Mars\u2019s longitudinal refraction at 15\u00b0 is added to it.", "1099": "But this is quite small.", "1100": "For Cancer and Leo are setting extremely obliquely, and Mars's large northern latitude put it at nearly the same altitude as Cor Leonis.", "1101": "On January 17 at 5h 20m in the evening,13 Mars was 23\u00b0 16\u2019 from the foot of Erichthonius.", "1102": "On the following day, the 18th, at 3h 0m in the morning, this distance was 23\u00b0 9\u2019, and at 5h 5m in the evening it was 23\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019.", "1103": "So the motion over 23h 45m is 14\u00bd\u2019, but over 9h 40m it is 7\u2019.", "1104": "This should have been 6\u2019.", "1105": "We are left with a longitudinal parallax of no more than 1\u2019.", "1106": "Refraction does not affect anything, since in both instances the altitude of Mars was about 30\u00b0.", "1107": "Likewise, at 7h 34m its distance from the seventh star of Gemini14 was 7\u00b0 51\u2019.", "1108": "At 4h 52m in the morning, it was 7\u00b0 59\u2019 from the same star.", "1109": "Therefore, over 9h 18m it moved 8\u2019.", "1110": "We thus have one minute more than before.", "1111": "Of this star (at the shoulder of Gemini), Brahe wrote, \u201cNote that I am taking Mars\u2019s distance from this star because its course passes through it, as it were, so that the morning and evening distances compared might show the parallax.\u201d I have reproduced this here so that the reader may rest assured that Brahe did not proceed without a purpose.", "1112": "On January 18 at 8h 52m in the evening15 there was 44\u00b0 22\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis.", "1113": "At 4\u00beh in the morning the same distance was 44\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019.", "1114": "Therefore, the motion over 7h 53m was 5\u2153\u2019.", "1115": "On January 19 following, at 7h 3m, this distance was 44\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019.", "1116": "Therefore, for 22h 11m the motion is 10\u00bd\u2019.", "1117": "And for 8 hours there would be less than 4\u2019 of motion.", "1118": "Our profit is about 1\u00bd\u2019 of parallax.", "1119": "But now let us calculate, for January 17, how much of an increase in the hourly motion should result from a parallax greater than the solar parallax as usually accepted.", "1120": "Since we consider the sun\u2019s parallax to be three minutes, let Mars have four.", "1121": "16", "1122": "It follows that the motion of mars over those hours should have appeared 4\u2019 greater than what follows proportionally from the diurnal motion.", "1123": "Since this is repudiated by the observations, Mars\u2019s parallax is found \u2013 often none at all.", "1124": "There was even an occasional note in Brahe\u2019s hand saying, \u201cIt strayed over to the wrong side.\u201d So this is the first way of investigating Mars\u2019s parallax.", "1125": "I shall now add the other way, because of its beauty; I cannot use the Brahean observations in it.", "1126": "Therefore, in using my own observations, I am going to give you a clown show, and will show by example why Brahe needed such diligence, precision of instruments, assistants, and other equipment.", "1127": "I have two instruments, which I use through the generosity of Baron Friedrich Hoffmann, L.B ^17.", "1128": "an iron sextant and a brass azimuthal quadrant.", "1129": "The latter is two and a half feet in diameter and the former three and a half, and both are calibrated in one-minute divisions.", "1130": "Now at this very time, 1604, at which I am considering parallax (whether that of the sun more than Mars\u2019s is hard to say, for my Hipparchus18 requires Mars\u2019s aid even in the lunar eclipses), a very suitable occasion for observation arose, if only the climate zone had been different and Mars had moved a little higher.", "1131": "For about 19/29 February19 of this year 1604, Mars was stationary both in longitude and in latitude at the same time.", "1132": "This occurred in Libra, and therefore from Mars\u2019s rising to the sun\u2019s rising the angle of the horizon with the ecliptic continually decreased.", "1133": "Consequently, according to Ch.", "1134": "9 of the Astronomiae Optica20 the latitudinal parallax, if any, continually increases.", "1135": "But from the increment (found through the columns of the parallactic table21 opposite the initial and final angles of the ecliptic with the horizon), the whole horizontal parallax (at the front of the column) is known.", "1136": "There follows the series of my observations ^22.", "1137": "On the night between Thursday and Friday, which was February 17/27, while Corvus was on the meridian, there was 9\u00b0 44\u2019 between Mars and Spica, and between it and the Northern Pan,23 17\u00b0 41\u2019; and between Mars and Arcturus, 29\u00b0 13\u2019.", "1138": "Also, to test the sextant, we measured the interval between Arcturus and Spica as 32\u00b0 57\u2019, which should have been 33\u00b0 1\u2019 45\u201d, as is clear if you calculate it using the right ascensions and declinations, or latitudes and longitudes, which Tycho assigned to these stars in Book I of the Progymnasmata ^24.", "1139": "Therefore, my distances are smaller than the true distances by 4\u00be minutes.", "1140": "I applied this correction to the distances of Mars from the fixed stars, so as to make it 9\u00b0 48\u2019 45\u201d from Spica, 17\u00b0 45\u2019 45\u201d from the Pan, and 29\u00b0 17\u2019 45\u201d from Arcturus ^25.", "1141": "I then used the quadrant to obtain the meridian altitude of Mars, 32\u00b0 4\u2019, and of Spica, 30\u00b0 50\u2019.", "1142": "Since the latter has a declination of 9\u00b0 2\u2019, Mars is left with a declination of 7\u00b0 48\u201d.", "1143": "However, the altitude of Spica showed that my perpendicular was not well enough set up.", "1144": "For the altitude of the equator, at my location, is 39\u00b0 54\u2019.", "1145": "Accordingly, the meridian altitude of Spica is 30\u00b0 52\u2019, and of Mars, 32\u00b0 6\u2019.", "1146": "Now, from the declination of Mars and its distance from the fixed star, its right ascension comes out: 26", "1147": "I am not certain whether, when (as happened a few times) the clamps holding the arm loosened and it (being a heavy piece of iron) fell precipitously and hit hard, it might not have changed the position of the sights, since they are removable and

was impossible to handle the iron and close the clamps with bare hands, and with gloves the arm was not securely enough clamped to be read to the minutes.", "1174": "Vindemiatrix32 showed a meridian

29\u00b0 18\u2153\u2019.", "1178": "Now since, according to the Prutenic Tables and to my computations, Mars was stationary in longitude at this time, there could be no change in meridian altitude

any change in the latitude occur during this time.", "1180": "On February 22 or March 3 we tested the sextant, just as we had done above, and found 26\u00b0 2\u2019 between Canis Minor and Orion\u2019s higher shoulder,33 which the calculation shows to be 26\u00b0 2\u2019 15\u201d.", "1181": "So also, between Canis minor and Palilicium34 was found 46\u00b0 22\u00bd\u2019, which Tycho, in his Epistolae, indicates is 46\u00b0 22\u2019 ^35.", "1182": "Therefore, when the fifth star of Leo36 culminated, with the arm of the instrument fixed above 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019 the distance was now more, while no error could be found at 29\u00b0 15\u2019.", "1183": "Then the whole sky unexpectedly clouded over.", "1184": "It became clear again on the morning of March 4, and now, when Antares culminated, with the arm fixed at 29\u00b0 19\u2019, both stars were seen evenly [with the sights].", "1185": "However, it seemed that something needed to be added, but at 29\u00b0 20\u2019 too much had been added.", "1186": "When the observation was finished, Saturn preceded the meridian by less than Jupiter preceded Saturn.", "1187": "On the night following February 29 or March 10, the instrument having meanwhile been displaced, this distance was, first, between 29\u00b0 9\u2019 and 29\u00b0 10\u2019, half an hour before the culmination of the Heart of Hydra ^37.", "1188": "Later, it appeared to the investigators to be between 29\u00b0 12\u2019 and 29\u00b0 13\u2019, as it was now higher and free from refraction.", "1189": "For at the end of this observation it had an altitude of 19\u2159\u2019.", "1190": "But a little afterward \u2013 I do not know whether the sights were disturbed \u2013 it would not allow that much, for it appeared to be 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019.", "1191": "The Tail of Leo38 was about half a degree from the meridian.", "1192": "The altitude of Mars was then 24\u00be\u00b0.", "1193": "The Tail of Leo, when culminating, had the correct altitude of 56\u00b0 44\u2019, within one minute.", "1194": "When one third of the distance between Mars and Spica had crossed the meridian, it [i.e., the distance to Arcturus] first appeared to us to be 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019, but the cylinder was not well enough applied, as it was too long.", "1195": "Thus, a little later, this could not be accepted, but 29\u00b0 10\u00bc\u2019 or a little less seemed to be required.", "1196": "And Mars was see on both sides of the cylinder.", "1197": "Then, between Mars and Spica, there was 9\u00b0 26\u2019, and less than 9\u00b0 27\u2019.", "1198": "Mars culminated at an altitude of 32\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019.", "1199": "39", "1200": "There was then 18\u00b0 25\u2019 between Mars and the Norther Pan [of Libra].", "1201": "For the investigation of the sextant, the distance between Spica and the Pan was taken as 27\u00b0 39\u2019, although it should have been 27\u00b0 34\u2019 ^40.", "1202": "Also, the distance between Spica and the northern star in the head of Scorpius41 was 39\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019, which should have been 39\u00b0 26\u00bd\u2019.", "1203": "So the sextant read five minutes high.", "1204": "Furthermore, calculation of Mars\u2019s position also provides evidence of this.", "1205": "For unless you diminish Mars\u2019s distance from the fixed stars by 5 minutes, the right ascension measured through Spica and through the Pan will be discrepant by 10 minutes, but if (as required by the examination of the sextant) the five minutes be subtracted, they will coincide exactly, and will be 205\u00b0 27\u2019 10\u201d, with declination 7\u00b0 35\u00bd\u2019.", "1206": "Therefore, the position is 26\u00b0 18\u2019 48\u201d Libra, with latitude 2\u00b0 47\u2019 20\u201d.", "1207": "You see that the latitude is manifestly the same, though meanwhile the planet had retrogressed 38\u2019 in longitude.", "1208": "If, from the position of Mars found thus, you find its distance from Arcturus, it will come out to be 29\u00b0 9\u2159\u2019, while using the faulty instrument it was 29\u00b0 14\u2019.", "1209": "Now, with the Heart of Scorpius42 culminating, our distance [to Arcturus] was 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019, the instrument in the meantime having been displaced and later repositioned.", "1210": "We next tested the sextant again, which showed 44\u00b0 45\u2019 between Polaris and the Tail of Cygnus ^43.", "1211": "This should have been 44\u00b0 39\u00bd\u2019.", "1212": "Therefore, the instrument was in its pristine state.", "1213": "But when Saturn had passed the meridian by one degree, the distance could not admit 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019; nevertheless, it was greater than 29\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019, about 29\u00b0 13\u2019.", "1214": "So this is the series of observations.", "1215": "I would be crazy if I tried to use them to build something of great precision.", "1216": "Therefore, I am presenting an example to another more diligent and successful observer, rather than an argument.", "1217": "I also hope that the nausea evoked by these uncertain observations will lead readers to desire all the more fervently the extremely certain Tychonic ones.", "1218": "Now, on with the example.", "1219": "The first and second days, agree only in showing the station in latitudinal motion.", "1220": "In both, Mars was 29\u00b0 18\u2019 from Arcturus, and in both, its meridian altitude was 32\u00b0 7\u2019 or 6\u2019.", "1221": "Those days were busying me in preparation for meeting the following days properly, should the instruments be needed.", "1222": "But on March 3, with the Mouth of Leo44 culminating, the distance was 29\u00b0 15\u2019, and with the Heart of Scorpius45 culminating, 29\u00b0 19\u2019 plus.", "1223": "Therefore the distance changed about 4\u00bc\u2019 over the interval.", "1224": "And since Arcturus and Mars have very nearly the same longitude,46 this change of distance bespeaks a variation of latitudinal parallax.", "1225": "I am not unaware that 29\u00b0 19\u2019 is hardly different from 29\u00b0 18\u2019, and that by analogy with the previous day the latter ought to be the distance at about the same time if Mars is standing still.", "1226": "I also know that when the Mouth of Leo is on the meridian Mars is 12\u00bd\u00b0 high and is somewhat affected by refraction.", "1227": "But of these we shall speak afterwards.", "1228": "For now, let us entirely ignore them, so as not to complicate our example.", "1229": "Now the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u2153\u00b0 (about) when the Mouth of Leo was culminating, but finally, after the Heart of Scorpius had culminated, it was 20\u2153\u00b0.", "1230": "Let me therefore look through the parallactic table to find the column in which, from a distance from the zenith of 32\u2154\u00b0 to a distance of 69\u2154\u00b0, the entry in the table would change 4\u00bc\u2019.", "1231": "I find that this happens in the column whose heading is 9\u2019 ^47.", "1232": "Therefore, the maximum parallax of Mars would be 9\u2019.", "1233": "And since, on that day, the distance of Mars and earth was to the distance of Mars and the sun as 28 is to 60 (given approximately by an anticipatory acquaintance with the hypotheses of Tycho and Copernicus), the ratio of the parallaxes will be the inverse of this, and the maximum  solar parallax will be about 4\u2019 24\u201d.", "1234": "It is set at 3\u2019 0\u201d.", "1235": "But now let us consider that at an altitude of 12\u00bd\u00b0 Mars would be subject to refraction, if the table of fixed star refractions constructed at Hven is valid for Prague.", "1236": "At this altitude, it was 4\u2019 20\u201d, 2\u2019 18\u201d of which is owed to the latitude, by which Mars is caused to be closer to Arcturus.", "1237": "If, however, we apply the sun\u2019s refraction to Mars (as it often appears we should), it is 8\u2019 45\u201d at this altitude, twice as great.", "1238": "Therefore, the latitudinal parallax would also be twice as great, 4\u2019 36\u201d.", "1239": "In this way, the whole difference which observation imposes upon itself, at these two different moments, would be due entirely to refraction.", "1240": "Reckoning it in the former way would leave a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 \u2013 the difference in parallax in the column whose heading is 5\u2019.", "1241": "This would give the sun only 2\u2019 25\u201d of maximum parallax.", "1242": "So refraction makes our third day, too, suspect and doubtful, and ultimately quite worthless.", "1243": "I know that since Arcturus and Mars are 9 degrees apart,48 which is one third of the amount by which Arcturus\u2019s latitude exceeds Mars\u2019s, it comes out that not all the latitudinal refraction is subtracted from the distances from Mars, and that the parallax changes Mars\u2019s latitude more than it changes this distance from Arcturus.", "1244": "But since this is very small, I have, with greater fear, considered it as something to be left buried.", "1245": "Let him observe it who is versed in more subtle matters.", "1246": "Now on the fourth day, what seems to have been accomplished is nothing other than the total destruction of Mars\u2019s parallax.", "1247": "The meridian distance ought to have been 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019 with an accurate instrument, and consequently 29\u00b0 14\u2019 with the faulty one.", "1248": "But at the end it was found to be 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019, when the latitudinal parallax (had there been any) ought to have been greater, and hence the distance from Arcturus greater.", "1249": "Hence, from that time when Mars attained an altitude of 19\u00b0, the distance was found to be 29\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019, and one minute greater at the end.", "1250": "This would be a very small parallax.", "1251": "And what is this ratio?", "1252": "When its altitude was 9 degrees (when Hydra was culminating), the distance was 29\u00b0 9\u2019 with a faulty instrument, and still subject to refraction.", "1253": "Later, at an altitude of 25\u00b0 and near the meridian, it was again 29\u00b0 9\u2019, measured twice at different moments.", "1254": "Could the refraction have been zero initially, that the arc thus remain constant?", "1255": "Or should it rather be said that I (though to myself I might have seemed most diligent) erred in observing?", "1256": "Especially on account of the length of the cylinder.", "1257": "Still, it is at least established by these observations, whatever their quality, that Mars\u2019s parallaxes of latitude are not greater than 4\u2019, which is the amount of uncertainty in the instrument.", "1258": "It is more credible that the parallax is very small.", "1259": "In Ch.", "1260": "64 below, you will find further discussion of this point.", "1261": "That the parallaxes of Mars are greater than the sun\u2019s, on the other hand, is argued by the proportion in the Tychonic and Copernican hypothesis; and from this proportion Mars\u2019s parallax could easily be computed if we were certain of the sun\u2019s parallax.", "1262": "Is, then, the procedure for finding the sun\u2019s altitude and parallax from eclipses uncertain?", "1263": "It is indeed relatively uncertain quantitatively, but as concerns the thing itself it is perfectly certain.", "1264": "The sun is not nearer than 230 semidiameters of the earth, but it is not an infinite number of semidiameters away.", "1265": "But between 700 and 2000 semidiameters (of which the first quantity is from my Mysterium cosmographicum, while the other two are given as the upper and lower limits in observations of eclipses) it does not appear that any indisputable number has yet been demonstrated, as I shall prove in my Hipparchus.", "1266": "Chapter 12", "1267": "Investigation of Mars\u2019s Nodes.", "1268": "Means are not wanting of investigating the planets\u2019 first inequality through observations, even when these are entangled in the second inequality.", "1269": "Nevertheless, in this second part, I prefer to follow the footsteps of the authorities and make use of acronychal observations, in order to establish my credibility.", "1270": "For I want to be sure that later, when I bring forth something contrary to accepted opinion, no one may complain that I am hiding behind the briar-path of my own method.", "1271": "Furthermore, it is now clear that nothing of any importance is wanting in Mars\u2019s diurnal parallax as taken by Tycho.", "1272": "I shall therefore move on, little by little, towards the reduction of the observed positions of Mars to the point opposite the sun\u2019s apparent position.", "1273": "As a first step, we must find the nodes.", "1274": "Tycho Brahe used to investigate them thus:", "1275": "In the diagram of Ch.", "1276": "9, let A be the position of the node, E the planet\u2019s position on the ecliptic in 1595, C the observed sidereal position of the planet, 17\u00b0 56\u2019 5\u201d Taurus, EC the observed latitude, 0\u00b0 5\u2019 15\u201d north.", "1277": "Now it is presupposed that the angle EAC is very nearly 4\u00b0 34\u00bd\u2019, the same as the maximum northern latitude observed in the same way in 1585.", "1278": "In the right triangle CEA (or the isosceles triangle CBA; the difference is unimportant in this procedure), from side CE and angle EAC he sought the length EA, the distance of the ecliptic position from the node.", "1279": "There is nothing wrong with this operation, since EC is small and near", "1280": "the node.", "1281": "However, the need for accuracy1 in this demonstration commends another.", "1282": "For it was said in Ch.", "1283": "9 that the angle EAC is not constant; hence, through different latitudes of different oppositions they will also show different positions for the node.", "1284": "Nor is EAC as great as the maximum apparent latitude, because AC is a curved arc; and neither is it AC, but some path inside (AF, say), that is the planet\u2019s path as it would be seen from the center of the sun.", "1285": "Therefore, A will not necessarily be the node, at least as found through this operation.", "1286": "I, therefore, investigated the nodes differently, using observations on the day on which they were at the node.", "1287": "Even though this method depends upon some preconceptions, and the subject will be treated more accurately below in Part 5, we ought to have a first taste of it here, if only to give confirmation.", "1288": "My presupposition was that when the planet, in its eccentric position, is truly at the node, it can by no disposition of the earth or sun be made to appear elsewhere than at the node.", "1289": "For in the Copernican hypothesis, this in itself is in agreement with the nature of things: that the moving faculty of any star is not bound to observe a star foreign to it (including the earth), but has its own laws governing its circuit.", "1290": "In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, this would be exactly as if one were to say that the epicycle pays heed, not to a line from the sun through its own center, but to certain positions beneath the fixed stars, beneath which  it places the planet in the plane of the ecliptic.", "1291": "In the Tychonic system, the same will be said of the eccentric.", "1292": "Further, that which I presupposed, I have found to be true using the following observations:", "1293": "On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m in the evening, Mars's declination was 9\u00b0 26\u2019", "1294": "N, and the right ascension was 22\u00b0 35\u2019 10\u201d ^2.", "1295": "Hence, its position comes out as 24\u00b0 22\u2019 56\u201d Aries, and its latitude as 3\u2019 12\u201d south.", "1296": "Parallax and refraction were opposite and approximately equal, and are therefore ignored.", "1297": "On 1592 January 23 at 10h 15m in the evening, Mars was at 11\u00b0 34\u2019 30\u201d Aries with latitude 0\u00b0 2\u2019 south ^3.", "1298": "The altitude of Mars was 25\u00b0, and therefore (from the table for the fixed stars),4 there was no refraction.", "1299": "The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5.", "1300": "Nearly all of this was latitudinal.", "1301": "Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic.", "1302": "For on February 6 it was already at about 7\u2019 northern latitude ^6.", "1303": "On the evening of 1593 December 10, Mars was observed at the ascending node.", "1304": "For after correction of the horizontal variations it retained no more than 0\u00b0 0\u2019 45\u201d north latitude ^7.", "1305": "On 1595 October 27 at 12h 20m, Mars's true latitude after the removal of parallax was 0\u00b0 2\u2019 20\u201d south ^8.", "1306": "On the 28th, when the parallax had similarly been removed, the latitude was 0\u00b0 0\u2019 25\u201d north ^9.", "1307": "Therefore,*  in the meanwhile, it was at the ascending node.", "1308": "Counting backwards 687 days, the number of days in Mars\u2019s revolution on its eccentric, starting from noon on 28 October, the end will fall on 1593 December 10, while on the preceding night Mars was observed near the node.", "1309": "Count back another 687.", "1310": "This will end up at 1592 January 23, when the planet was observed right at the node.", "1311": "If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh.", "1312": "From this it is known that it makes no difference where the earth is, either in sidereal position or with respect to Mars.", "1313": "In the Ptolemaic system, it makes no difference where the sun is with respect to the center of Mars\u2019s epicycle and where Mars is on the epicycle, and in the Tychonic system, it makes no difference where the center of the eccentric or the sun is located with respect to the line from Mars through the earth, so drawn that Mars lies in the plane of the ecliptic.", "1314": "For the diameter of the nodes is always the same in Copernicus and Ptolemy, and in Tycho it is always parallel to itself, except that over the ages the nodes move slightly.", "1315": "This motion was not perceived over these six years.", "1316": "Now let us find the opposite node.", "1317": "I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8\u00b0, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0\u00b0 3\u2019 46\u201d N, and it was itself at 13\u00b0 36\u2019 40\u201d Sagittarius ^11.", "1318": "The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun.", "1319": "Refraction, on the other hand, is large: 6\u2019 45\u201d from the table for the fixed stars, or 11 minutes from the table for the sun ^12.", "1320": "This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13.", "1321": "Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude\u2014about 2 or 3, or even more.", "1322": "II.", "1323": "On the night of 1589 April 15 Mars's observed latitude was 1\u00b0 7\u2019 north ^14.", "1324": "The parallax of the annual orb was drastically increased, owing to the approach of Mars and earth.", "1325": "After 21 days, the latitude decreased to a paltry 6\u2154\u2019 north ^15.", "1326": "And thus, although on May 6 it decreased somewhat more slowly, since the star was moving away from the earth, we shall still not be far wrong if we extrapolate proportionally: we make 21 days be to the number of days after which Mars falls upon the ecliptic, as 60 minutes of diminution is to the 6\u2154 minutes remaining.", "1327": "This rule shows it to be two and one third days, so that Mars was at the node on May 9.", "1328": "Once again, counting thrice 687 days thence, we will come out on 1594 December 30.", "1329": "On this day, Mars ought to have been at the node, and for the next 5 days\u2014up to the morning of January 4\u2014it should have been moving off southward.", "1330": "And indeed, from observations of it on January 4, we have given it a few minutes of south latitude.", "1331": "Mars was not observed more frequently at this eccentric position.", "1332": "It is enough that we have this 1595 observation, provided that it does not disagree with us.", "1333": "In 1589 there is nothing that we can bring into question.", "1334": "Nor should it disturb you that in 1589 we assigned a latitudinal motion of 6\u2154\u2019 to 2\u2153 days, while we do not allow so much over a 5-day period around 1595 January 4.", "1335": "For, as will appear in the course of this work, the latitude is most attenuated at conjunction with the sun (as in 1595), owing to the parallaxes of the annual orb, and at opposition (as in 1589) it is augmented.", "1336": "It is therefore fitting that the diurnal motion in latitude appear less in 1595, and greater in 1589.", "1337": "Now, how are the sidereal positions of the two nodes found?", "1338": "Thus: one finds an approximate value for the mean position of Mars at each place, using tables for Mars (which, accordingly, we presuppose for this purpose).", "1339": "Whether you do this with the help of the Prutenic or Tychonic tables, taking into account the true precession of the equinox, you will find that on the morning of 1594 December 30, the mean position of Mars is 27\u00b0 14\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio, and on the morning of 1595 October 28 it was at 5\u00b0 31\u2019 Taurus.", "1340": "It therefore appears that the diameter of the nodes does not pass through the center of equable motion,16 but far beneath it.", "1341": "For from 5\u00b0 31\u2019 Taurus to 27\u00b0 14\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio is more than from the latter to the former.", "1342": "If, on the other hand, you make use of the Tychonic equations, 11\u00b0 17\u2019 must be added to the latter figure and 11\u00b0 30\u2019 subtracted from the former.", "1343": "Accordingly, the one comes out to be 15\u00b0 44\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio, and the other, 16\u00b0 48\u2019 Taurus, which are Mars\u2019s equated eccentric positions ^17.", "1344": "As you see, the nodes are nearly opposite one another at about 16\u2153\u02da Taurus and Scorpio, when viewed from the center of the planetary system, which Ptolemy described as a point very near the earth, and Copernicus and Tycho as a point very near the sun.", "1345": "Further, it will be seen in Part 5 below

13", "1347": "Investigation of the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of the orbit of Mars.", "1348": "In the previous chapter, the nodes and limits have been found quite accurately

is not so evident how to deduce this from the observations themselves.", "1351": "For the angle of this inclination is set up around the center of the planetary system, which for Copernicus and Tycho is the sun.", "1352": "But the eye cannot be placed at the sun so that this inclination might thence appear beneath the fixed stars and be measured, and the maximum distance of the limit from the ecliptic, seen from another place, will also be seen under another angle.", "1353": "In the Ptolemaic form there might appear to be a more direct procedure, but this is not so.", "1354": "For it will be demonstrated that the plane of the epicycle always remains parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.", "1355": "Therefore, place the center of the plane of the epicycle at either limit, and let the planet lie on the same line of longitude passing from the center of vision through the center of the epicycle.", "1356": "The planet will then either be more distant than the center of the epicycle from the observer, and thus its distance from the ecliptic will appear less than the distance of the center of the epicycle from the same ecliptic, or it will be nearer to the observer, and will thus appear greater than what we seek.", "1357": "In this difficulty we may take consolation from this one circumstance: that the purpose for which we seek to know the inclination as one of our principles is not such as to require the highest accuracy.", "1358": "It will consequently permit us to use those means which furnish indirect evidence of the quantity of the inclination: we shall offer three of these.", "1359": "Now it is apparent from what has just been said that it will be most directly helpful to us if we find an observation of the star Mars at that moment at which Mars is reported to be equidistant from the sun and the earth and on the line drawn from the sun to 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius (the positions of the limits).", "1360": "In the Ptolemaic form, this is where the center of the epicycle is at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius and Mars is as far from the earth as is the center of the epicycle.", "1361": "In Mercury alone this problem does not occur.", "1362": "Let B be the sun, A the earth, and upon AB let the isosceles triangle ABC be set up, with C the planet\u2019s position in the plane of the ecliptic; and, CE being drawn perpendicular to the orbit of Mars, let the body of Mars be at E. EC will therefore appear the same whether seen from B the sun or A the earth \u2014this is immediately evident.", "1363": "But in order that it be known at what position Mars is equidistant from the sun and the earth, observe that when the lines from Mars at C and the earth at A falling upon the sun at B make the angle CBA right, then CB is shorter than CA.", "1364": "Consequently, BA, the position opposite the sun\u2019s, should make with BC, the eccentric position of Mars, an angle less than 90\u00b0, in order that CAB and CBA be equal.", "1365": "Therefore, if BC is directed toward 17 Leo, the sun ought to be beyond 17 Taurus and before 17 Scorpio.", "1366": "Or if on the contrary BC is directed toward 17 Aquarius, the sun should be beyond 17 Scorpio and before 17 Taurus.",

the epicycle, and B Mars, CAB will not be able to be right, as CA and CB are to be made equal.", "1369": "So the anomaly of commutation2 ought to be more than 90\u00b0 or less than 270\u00b0.", "1370": "If you wish to work a little more precisely, take from Copernicus or from an anticipation of Tycho\u2019s reformation the approximate ratio 1525:1000 as (in Copernicus) the ratio of the

dropped perpendicular to AB), where AD, which is half AB, is 1000, AC will be 3333\u2153.", "1374": "Looking this up in a table of secants, we find the angles CAD and CBD to be 72\u00b0 33\u2019.",

towards 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or thereabouts, the apparent position of Mars, AC, ought to be 72\u00bd\u00b0 from the apparent position of the sun AB.", "1377": "And with BC at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0

seen to be 6s 5\u00b0 5\u2019, which is 5\u00b0 5\u2019 more than half.", "1815": "The planet consequently takes a proportionally shorter time from Virgo through Aquarius to Pisces.", "1816": "Now if you examine adjacent positions one at a time and compare the intervening arcs with the times or with the arcs of mean longitude, you will see that the planet is slowest at one fixed point on the zodiac, and swiftest at the opposite point, and that at the intermediate points its motion gradually increases or decreases, according to its proximity to one or the other.", "1817": "These things reveal first of all that the motion of a planet (however irregular it may appear) is governed according to cycles, and that the present cycle is the successive modification of motion and a return to its same state.", "1818": "For if the planet moved in straight lines joined by angles (such as if it should move around a pentangle\u2014I was once engaged in such ideas), its motion would sometimes suddenly change from swifter to slower in an evident manner, according to the relationship of the lines, and this would happen not in one but in many places on the zodiac, according to the number of lines.", "1819": "However, since so great an inequality still remains in the planet\u2019s motion, after the removal of the inequality that depends upon the sun, it therefore will be incapable of being either governed or demonstrated by the supposition of a simple circle (one set up at the center of observation).", "1820": "This can, however, be done by composition of several circles, or the equivalent (as Ptolemy said in his preliminaries to Book 3).", "1821": "The simplest ways of doing this are two: by using either an eccentric circle or a concentric with an epicycle.", "1822": "Thus Ptolemy chooses an eccentric for the first inequality, for the sake of distinguishing between the two and providing an aid to comprehension, since an epicycle would be required for the second inequality.", "1823": "Then, thinking over this general description, he denies that a mere eccentric suffices the planets.", "1824": "For he first considered closely what would duly follow from the simultaneous revolution of an epicycle (to account for the second inequality) and an eccentric (for the first inequality), and it was then evident, by comparing observations, that the center of the epicycle approaches much nearer to the earth at apogee, and flees farther from it at perigee, than the simple eccentric that accounts for the first inequality allows.", "1825": "From this discovery, by a continuous train of thought, he alights on the measure of this approach, and relates that he discovered that the center of the eccentric that carries the center of the epicycle is exactly at the midpoint between the center of observation, the earth, and the center of uniformity or of the eccentric accounting for the first inequality.", "1826": "And, without a single demonstration, he nevertheless relies upon this principle for the three superior planets.", "1827": "Copernicus, as he frequently did on other occasions, here too followed his master  religiously, his form of hypothesis being accommodated to this measure.", "1828": "Not without reason, astronomers have wondered about this, and I among them (using Maestlin\u2019s voice), as you see in the Mysterium cosmographicum Ch.", "1829": "22 p.", "1830": "79.", "1831": "Despite my having opined, in that passage of the said book, that Ptolemy used blind guesswork to establish this, the truth is the opposite.", "1832": "For he was able to prove it with a perfectly good demonstration given a suitable  observation, as I shall demonstrate below.", "1833": "One finds fault with the theorist only in that he did not transmit to posterity those observations along with the demonstration.", "1834": "And so, since I thought then that this was altogether too much to assume,4 and also saw it pointedly called into question by Copernicus when he argued for a change in Mars\u2019s eccentricity on the basis of his figures which were not in accord with this bisection of the eccentricity, I envisaged a method which would lead me to a knowledge of the ratio of the two eccentricities (because, as I said, it is not indubitably 2:1).", "1835": "And since Ptolemy used three acronychal5 observations and this preconceived opinion of the ratio of the eccentricities to find the position of the apogee, the correction of the mean longitude, and finally, the magnitude of the eccentricity, I saw that in order to weaken the sinews of the problem (once the axiom of the ratio of the eccentricity is taken away), it will be indeterminate and not having a single case, and thus I would need in addition the support of a fourth acronychal observation.", "1836": "And so, in the year 1600, having acquired knowledge of this art, I came to Tycho, and was happy to learn that he too did not assume this ratio, but made an investigation, as his figures indicate.", "1837": "For he makes the center of the (Copernican*)  eccentric distant from the center of vision by 13,680 units, while the point of equality in turn is another 3,780 of these units beyond that.", "1838": "In the Ptolemaic form, this would be as if he were to make the distance of the centers of vision and of the eccentric 9,900, and the remaining distance between the center of the eccentric and the point of equality 7,560.", "1839": "Now I myself could also have taken the bisection of the eccentricity as certainly established, and with better reason than Ptolemy, because in Ch.", "1840": "22 of  my Mysterium I had brought forward a physical cause for the bisection.", "1841": "Indeed, it was for this very reason that I had come to Tycho, that I might use his observations to inquire further into my opinions expressed in that book.", "1842": "I of course did this without prejudice, and continue to do so.", "1843": "And if I survive to see astronomy achieve its purity and perfection, so that a verdict can be given in the case which I have brought before her tribunal in that book, I promise the reader that I shall retract that book and, upon confirming what is seen as true, will faithfully reveal the remainder that has turned out not to be so ^6.", "1844": "But back to the argument.", "1845": "About center B let the

was just said above) these are not proportional about A. Now let F, G, D, and E be four observations distributed about the circumference of the circle, so situated that the planet, stripped of the second inequality, would appear there as if  viewed from point A.

the world (for Ptolemy).", "2330": "Consequently, what we had previously constructed from the Brahean observations we have later in turn destroyed using other observations of his.", "2331": "This was the necessary consequence of our having followed (in imitation of previous theorists) several things that were plausible but really false.", "2332": "And this much of the work is dedicated to this

of equality of motion.", "2335": "This, then, is the way our predecessors measured the first inequality.", "2336": "With this calculation established, which would represent the planet's eccentric position at any desired moment, they next turned to exploring the second inequality (which depends upon the sun), comparing the observed or apparent position with that which the eccentric and the planet's first inequality alone would assign.", "2337": "When I was on this same path and was confronted with this equivocal fork in the road (in Chapters 19 and 20 above), and the observations (most faithful guides) were seen to be at war with observations, I had to give thought to altering completely the way the path was set out, using the method which follows.", "2338": "First, in this third

principles but had doubts about.", "2340": "Once this is found it will be like a key: the rest will be opened up.", "2341": "Afterwards, in Part IV, I shall proceed to the first inequality.", "2342": "In Chapter 22 of the Mysterium cosmographicum, when I was giving the physical cause of the Ptolemaic equant or of the Copernican-Tychonic second epicycle, I raised an objection against myself at the end of the chapter: if the cause I proposed were true, it ought to hold universally for all planets ^1.", "2343": "But since the earth, one of the celestial bodies (for Copernicus), or the sun (for the rest) had not hitherto required this equant, I decided to leave that speculation open, until the matter were clearer to astronomers.", "2344": "I nevertheless entertained a suspicion that this theory might perchance also have its equant.", "2345": "After I gained the recognition of Tycho, this suspicion was confirmed in me.", "2346": "For in a letter to me in Styria in 1598 Brahe said the following:", "2347": "The annual orb according to Copernicus, or the epicycle according to Ptolemy, does not appear always of the same size, in comparisons made to the eccentric, but introduces a perceptible alteration in all three superior planets, so much so that for Mars the angle of difference reaches one degree 45' ^2.", "2348": "He also touched upon this point at the same time in the appendix to his Mechanica,3 an account of his studies.", "2349": "Also, his words in volume I p.", "2350": "209 of his letters4 are not much different, where he states the opinion that as an effect of the solar eccentricity a certain amount of nonuniformity is also mixed in with the eccentric equations and the acronychal positions.", "2351": "This is, in fact, refuted in Part I: it is not reflected in the acronychal positions, or at least very little.", "2352": "But it appears that this needs to be understood through a certain correction regarding Mars at 90\u00b0 from the sun.", "2353": "Now when I heard that the annual orb grows and shrinks, an inspiration said to me that this illusion arises thus: Copernicus's annual orb, or Ptolemy's epicycle, is not everywhere distant from that center about which by supposition it is sweeping out equal angles in equal times.", "2354": "For what physical cause  could make the circuit of the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or of the circuit of the earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle bearing the star (for Ptolemy) grow and shrink?", "2355": "What, I ask, is this novelty unprecedented in astronomy, this unlikely absurdity?", "2356": "Wouldn't it seem more worthy of belief that the sun (for Copernicus) or the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or the body of the planet (for Ptolemy) would in certain places be farther from, and in others nearer to, the selected point of uniform motion (at rest for Copernicus and Tycho, and moving around on the circumference of the eccentric for Ptolemy)\u2014and this especially on the line of apsides?", "2357": "And for this, that suspicion of mine arising from my Mysterium cosmographicum\u2014that an equant might be introduced into the theory of the sun (or, as I call it, the theory of the Ptolemaic epicycle)\u2014seemed to provide a convenient occasion.", "2358": "Let us suppose that the second inequality starts from the line of the sun's mean motion, as the practitioners have hitherto been pleased to hold (lest anyone hold suspect here my innovation of using the sun's apparent motion), and in the present diagram let the planet's eccentricity for Copernicus originate not from the sun's center A, but from the point C about which the earth's motion is supposed regular.", "2359": "But let that point C not be the center of the earth's orb DE but only of uniformity of motion, and let its distance from the sun A be greater than that of B, the center of the earth's orb ED.", "2360": "I say that, these things being granted, such observations will be produced from which one might suspect the annual orb of growing and shrinking.", "2361": "Let a line CF be drawn from C perpendicular to DE, and let the star Mars be at F twice: once when the earth is at D and again when it is at E; and let F be joined with the points D and E. Now because C is the point of uniformity of the earth's motion on DE, FCD and FCE will be the anomaly of commutation, and (as we suppose) equal on both sides.", "2362": "Now if CD and CE were equal (as has hitherto been thought) then the angles DFC and EFC, parallaxes of the orb, would be equal on both sides, for both anomalies of commutation.", "2363": "But because CE is greater than CD, the angle CFE will also appear greater than the angle CFD.", "2364": "Therefore, anyone not noticing that this growth occurs only at or about E, and that the contrary diminution occurs only at the contrary position D, will think that the entire annual orb sometimes gets larger, with radius CE, and sometimes smaller, with radius CD.", "2365": "This is because such a person presupposes, along with astronomy as it has hitherto been practiced, that the point of equal motion C is at the same time also the center of the circle DE.", "2366": "In the Ptolemaic form, let the earth be at C, and the lines of the sun's mean motion be CK, CL, in place of DC and EC in the preceding Copernican arrangement.", "2367": "And let the center about which the epicyclic motion is regular be at F, and IH be equal and parallel to ED so that, CI being drawn, it is parallel to DF and CH to  EF.", "2368": "For when the earth (or the observer) is transferred to the center of the world C, as Ptolemy has it, Mars at F is likewise transferred to H. Similarly, owing to the translation of D to C, F is transferred to I. Now Ptolemy, thinking that the point F, about which the motion of the epicycle IH is uniform, is also the center of the epicycle IH, supposed FI and FH to be exactly equal.", "2369": "Consequently, for both of the equated anomalies HFC as well as IFC (that is, at both 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0, in this diagram) he posited one and the same equation of the epicycle, namely, the equal angles HCF and ICF.", "2370": "So if observation affirms that HCF is greater than ICF, then the center of the epicycle will not be at the point of uniform motion F, but at G, in the direction of H. Further, on the supposition that F be nevertheless considered the center of the epicycle, the epicycle will appear distinctly enlarged at anomaly 90\u00b0 at H, and diminished at 270\u00b0 at I, while in both instances Mars, in its eccentric position (that is, on the line CF), is in the same position with respect to the fixed stars.", "2371": "In the Tychonic form, let C remain the earth, DE the sun's circle with center B, but let the center of uniform motion be A. And let the lines along which the planet is seen (namely, CI and CH) be the same as in Ptolemy.", "2372": "Accordingly, let HL, IK descend from H and I parallel to FC.", "2373": "In order that K and L be the center of the planetary system, let the center of its circuit be M, which is in the direction of the sun's perigee, so that the point M, the center of the circuit KL (in which is found the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) descends as far below C as the point B, the true center of the sun's circuit (contrary to common opinion), descends below A, the putative center of the same circuit of the sun.", "2374": "And let AC and BM be equal.", "2375": "The line of equated motion on the eccentric (that is, KI, LH) will be parallel to itself after an integral number of returns of the planet.", "2376": "Therefore Tycho, thinking that the earth C is in the middle of the circuit KL bearing the planets' eccentrics, will make angles CIK, CHL equal when the angles of commutation CLH, CKI are equal.", "2377": "But if these are perceived to be unequal, CHL being the greater, CL will be longer than CK: and the orb KL, the deferent of the center of the system, will appear to grow at L and to shrink at K, because M, the center of the orb which is the planetary system's deferent, is not believed to be elsewhere than at the earth C, about whose center the motion of that orb is uniform.", "2378": "Now what greatly contributes to obscuring the true cause of this difference, namely, to freeing the sun's eccentricity from suspicion, is the fact that thereby*  the distance CK of the center of the system from the earth becomes short just where the distance CE of the sun from the earth becomes long; and conversely, that the former, CL, becomes long where the latter, CD, becomes short.", "2379": "The reason why the apsides have thus been reversed is this.", "2380": "For Copernicus, the earth traverses the regions opposite the Tychonic sun and the Ptolemaic epicycle, and also DC, CE, the distances of the earth from the sun, of the sun from the earth, and of Mars H or I from the epicycle's center of uniform motion F, subtend angles of the same magnitude in all three forms of hypothesis.", "2381": "Therefore, it also happens that the Copernican distances of the sun and the earth will be transferred to the opposite sides by Brahe and Ptolemy; that is, CE to CL or FH, and CD to CK or FI.", "2382": "Next, in order either to confirm or undermine this speculation by observations, this is the road upon which I  set out.", "2383": "Since the sun's apogee is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, I enquired whether there might exist an observation in which Mars, reckoned by the first inequality, would be twice at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Libra or Aries, while the sun would be at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer at one time, and then at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn.", "2384": "As it turns out, this is not possible within such a short space of time (20 or 30 years).", "2385": "For the periodic motions of Mars and the sun are incommensurable, nor do they ever coincide at 90\u00b0 from one another, or at opposition, after a certain number of complete periods, or quarter or half periods, of either.", "2386": "I therefore had to choose the next best thing, which was to find many days throughout those 20 years on which the planet was observed, and in which the equated anomaly of commutation was 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0 or nearly that much, with Mars at 6 Aries or Libra or thereabouts.", "2387": "Afterwards, it was necessary to look up all those dates in the catalog of observations of Mars, so I could see whether it had been observed at those moments.", "2388": "Had the indefatigable Tycho Brahe not observed Mars very frequently, the selection would have been so exclusive that I would not have been able to accomplish what I wished.", "2389": "Now since Tycho put the apogee of Mars at 23\u00bd\u00b0 Leo, while the required position of Mars, corrected by the eccentric equation, was 5\u00bd\u00b0 Libra, an equated anomaly of 42\u00b0 was required.", "2390": "And from his table, to an equated anomaly of 42\u00b0 there corresponds an equation of 8\u00b0 15\u2157'; therefore, a mean anomaly on the eccentric of 50\u00b0 16' was required, and through this I was shown twelve points in time in the twenty years between 1579 and 1600.", "2391": "Thus, what had to be skillfully tracked down is whether for any of these times there was an equated anomaly of commutation that was at one time 90\u00b0 and again 270\u00b0, or if the former were greater or less, the latter would be correspondingly less or greater.", "2392": "One revolution of Mars has 687 days, and two of the sun have 730\u00bd.", "2393": "The difference is 43\u00bd days, to which corresponds 42\u00b0 54' 23\" of the sun's mean motion.", "2394": "This, therefore, is how much the anomaly of commutation changes at the end of any revolution of Mars.", "2395": "Therefore, when in any two year period one seeks two anomalies of commutation that are equal, with Mars at the same eccentric position, each angle of commutation should be 21\u00b0 27'.", "2396": "Over four years 42\u00b0 54' is required;

\u0396\u0397\u0395\u0398 instead, whose center lies in the direction of \u0392 from \u039a, very near to the line \u039a\u0392, which should be parallel to the line drawn from the earth \u0391 through the sun's perigee.", "2539": "Therefore, the epicycle's apogee lies in the direction of the sun's perigee.", "2540": "And because the epicycle, owing to the total equivalence just mentioned, is to be

it.", "2542": "In the Tychonic form, let A be the earth, and about it let the sun's concentric CD be described, and let this be considered to be the deferent of the system of the planets, since A is

is, that the earth proceeds nonuniformly on its orbit, slowing when it recedes far from the sun and speeding up when it approaches.", "2581": "This is in conformity with physical principles and with the analogy with other planets.", "2582": "In the same way it has been demonstrated in the Ptolemaic form that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point about which its motion is uniform, and that its eccentricity is half of the sun's eccentricity as it is commonly determined, and in the opposite direction.", "2583": "Finally, in the Tychonic form it has been demonstrated that the point whence originate the planets' eccentricities does not move on the sun's concentric, but throughout its course is unequally distant from the earth, about which it moves regularly and uniformly; and that it is farther away near the sun's perigee, and nearer at apogee, again by half of the sun's eccentricity.", "2584": "And so, since this Ptolemaic epicycle and this Brahean deferent have so great an analogy with the theory of the sun, it is likely that they also have a greater analogy: that is, the sun's true eccentricity, too, will only be half of that computed from the maximum equation; or, what is the same thing, the sun will make use of an equant, whose eccentricity is twice the eccentric's eccentricity.", "2585": "I admit that this line of argument is a little weaker when applied to the Ptolemaic and Tychonic form, insofar as we are using the sun's mean motion, following the authorities.", "2586": "The argument consequently will become clearer when, moved by those reasons adduced in Chapter 6 above, I measure out the planet's motion by the sun's apparent motion.", "2587": "Chapter 26", "2588": "demonstration from the same observations that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point of attachment or axis, and that the annual orb (and so also the earth's path around the sun, or the sun's around the earth) is eccentric with respect to the body of

\u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7  coalesce into one Ptolemaic position of the earth.", "2692": "Meanwhile, let the star Mars, which for Copernicus had stayed at one point \u03b8, now be placed about \u03b8 at four locations: \u03b9, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc. The description of this circle is as follows.", "2693": "Upward through \u03b8 let \u03b8\u03bd be drawn equal and parallel to \u03b3\u03b1.", "2694": "And about center \u03bd, with radius

Copernicus, the planet bodily traversed.", "2696": "While the epicycle is thus being borne around, the center \u03bd is driven around \u03b8, so that at one time it is inside \u03b8\u03b1 and at another it is outside; however, \u03b8\u03bd is always parallel to itself and to the line \u03b1\u03b3.", "2697": "And the epicycle will be moved uniformly, not about \u03b8 to which it is attached, nor about its center \u03bd, but about a higher point, \u03bf, such that \u03b8\u03bf is twice \u03b8\u03bd.", "2698": "For the earth too will thus be moved10 uniformly about \u03c0, not about the center of its orb \u03b3, nor about the sun at \u03b1.", "2699": "That these characteristics belong to the Ptolemaic epicycle, is properly demonstrated.", "2700": "But that they are carried over from the epicycle to the theory of the sun is shown by a probable argument only, pieced together from Ptolemaic opinions.", "2701": "For, keeping everything as it was, let \u03b1\u03c4 be set up equal to \u03b1\u03c0 and in the same line but in the opposite direction, so that \u03c4\u03b1 may be the center of the sun's uniform motion, which the theorists had thought to be the center of the sun's orbit.", "2702": "Therefore, the line \u03b8\u03bd\u03bf will always be parallel to the line of the sun's apogee \u03b1\u03c4.", "2703": "Now, if you decide that the diurnal parallax of Mars should be kept in the same ratio to the sun's parallax as that given out by Tycho, \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc will also be equal to the [circle of the] sun's theory, and consequently \u03b8\u03bf will also be equal to the eccentricity of the point \u03c4, about which the sun moves uniformly.", "2704": "But \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc also moves in the same direction in which the sun moves on its circle, according to Ptolemy, and at the same times both the sun on its eccentric and the planet on its epicycle are found in the same, or at least corresponding, places, so that lines from \u03c4 through the sun and from \u03bf through the planet are ever parallel, again as taught by Ptolemy.", "2705": "So, since all other things are in agreement, why not this, too: that, just as \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc is moved uniformly, not about the center \u03bd but about the point \u03bf above it, as is demonstrated here by the transposition of the eccentric of the earth into the epicycle, where we took \u03b8 in place of \u03b1, \u03bd for \u03b3, and \u03bf for \u03c0: so likewise, these points are distinct in the sun, so that the eccentricity \u03b1\u03c4, which is found from solar observations, is to be bisected at \u03be, with \u03be the center of the sun's eccentric \u03bb\u03c1\u03c3\u03c5?", "2706": "For Ptolemy made use of such a procedure to make it appear that if the sun's apparent positions were used, exactly the same eccentricity would be used on the planet's epicycle as was found in the sun.", "2707": "So since the observations give evidence of the double eccentricity of the Ptolemaic epicycle (because, as was said, the parallel relationships of the lines leave the triangles the same as in the Copernican form), the spirit of Ptolemy urges us to bisect the sun's eccentricity as well, so that the lines \u03bb\u03b9, \u03c1\u03ba, \u03c3\u03bb, \u03c5\u03bc remain parallel.", "2708": "So by this reasoning even Ptolemy will be persuaded that \u03b1\u03c4, the eccentricity of the sun's motion found by Tycho, should be bisected at \u03be, so that the center of the sun's orbit is at \u03be, and the uniformity of motion at \u03c4.", "2709": "Now this argument in the Ptolemaic form (as I just now began to say) is no firmer than the Ptolemaic world system itself.", "2710": "For anyone who believes Ptolemy, thinking that for the three superior planets there are three theories  of epicycles, exactly equal to the theory of the sun, in quantity and quality, in lines as well as motions, in absolutely all respects\u2014this same person will not admit this one inconsistency, but will also gladly derive this bisection for the solar theory from the epicycle, as if from an image in a mirror to the face itself.", "2711": "And finally, when a comparison of hypotheses has been made, and it has appeared that four theories of the sun (or rather, six, as will be said elsewhere) can be generated from a single theory of the earth, like many images from one substantial face, the sun itself, the clearest of truth, will melt all this Ptolemaic apparatus like butter, and will disperse the followers of Ptolemy, some to Copernicus's camp, and some to Brahe's.", "2712": "Here, one might raise a question.", "2713": "The Ptolemaic epicycle has three notable points: the center \u03bd, the point \u03b8 which we have called the point of attachment, and the point \u03bf about which its motion is uniform.", "2714": "Now since it is said that the line \u03b8\u03bf remains parallel to \u03b1\u03c4 throughout the entire circuit, what are the properties of the circuits described by the other two points \u03bd and \u03bf?", "2715": "In order to show this, let lines be drawn from \u03be and \u03c4\u03b1 parallel to \u03b1\u03b2, and from \u03b2 and \u03c7 parallel to \u03b1\u03c4, and let them be extended so as to intersect one another; and let the intersection of the lines from \u03be and \u03b2 be \u03c6, from \u03be and \u03c7 be \u03c8, from \u03c4 and \u03b2 be \u03c2, and from \u03c4 and \u03c7 be \u03c9. Now, just as the point \u03b8 is moved regularly around \u03c7, traversing an eccentric described about \u03b2, so also \u03bd is moved regularly around \u03c8, traversing an eccentric described about \u03c6. Also, \u03bf is moved regularly about \u03c9, traversing a third eccentric likewise equal to the others, described about \u03c2. For all three of these eccentrics the zodiacal position of the apogee is the same, owing to the lines' \u03b1\u03c7, \u03be\u03c8, \u03c4\u03c9 being parallel.", "2716": "But the word \"apogee\" cannot be applied properly to any of these, apart from the first, that belongs to the point \u03b8, since its line of apsides \u03b1\u03b2\u03c7 is drawn through the earth itself, which was placed at \u03b1, but not at \u03be or \u03c4.", "2717": "It is indeed true that straight lines can be drawn from the earth \u03b1 through the centers of the remaining two eccentrics \u03c6 and \u03c2, which may properly be called \"lines of the apogee\".", "2718": "These will fall to the west of the apogee \u03b1\u03c7; that is, \u03b1\u03c6 will be at 24\u00b0 Leo, and \u03b1\u03c2 at 19\u00b0 Leo, approximately.", "2719": "But then these lines will not pass through the pertinent point of uniform motion of each eccentric.", "2720": "Thus, if any of Ptolemy\u2019s followers does not wish to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point \u03b8, but prefers to relate it to the center \u03bd, he will be driven to use two lines of apsides: one, \u03b1\u03c6, for the eccentric, and the other, \u03b1\u03c8, for the equant; and also two eccentricities, \u03b1\u03c6 and \u03b1\u03c8.", "2721": "How intricate and inconvenient this is (for of its absurdity enough has been said in Chapter 6), let anyone so inclined judge.", "2722": "The same will happen if anyone wishes to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point \u03bf, about which the epicycle revolves uniformly.", "2723": "For then the eccentric bearing  the point \u03bf will have two apogees and eccentricities, one for the center on the line \u03b1\u03c2, and the other for the point of uniformity of motion on the line \u03b1\u03c9.", "2724": "The remaining possibilities are either to attach the epicycle at \u03b8, or improperly to take apogees for the eccentrics that bear the points \u03bd and \u03bf, and to compute the eccentricities from the points \u03be and \u03c4, not from the reference point, the earth \u03b1.", "2725": "What has been given so far is the first delineation in the Ptolemaic form.", "2726": "The other can be constructed as follows.", "2727": "Let the Copernican positions of the earth \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7, merge, not in \u03b1, but in \u03b3, so that in this diagram, \u03b3, not \u03b1, denotes the earth, the center of the world.", "2728": "Here, the epicycle too, as well as its three eccentrics belonging to the points \u03b8, \u03bd, \u03bf, will be shifted from their positions by the amount \u03b1\u03b3, and a perfect equivalence will result.", "2729": "I shall forego further explanation, lest the reader become too confused, for this has really only been mentioned for smatterers or curiosity seekers.", "2730": "Tychonic Form11", "2731": "In the Tychonic form, there is no need of any new delineation.", "2732": "A very brief sketch is sufficient.", "2733": "The eccentric's point of attachment is set at the four different positions \u03bb, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c5, so the planet is at \u03b9, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03b9\u03bb, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1, \u03bb\u03c3, \u03bc\u03c5, and \u03b8\u03b1 parallel.", "2734": "Now Tycho himself made the center of the circle of Mars carry the double epicycle, and said that it goes around a uniformly on a circle concentric with the sun: for this idea he was indebted to Ptolemy.", "2735": "And in this matter, he, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, was strongly urged by me (in Ch.", "2736": "6 of Part I) to seek that point of attachment, whether it is the center of the concentric or of an eccentric, in the center of the solar body, this being supported by physical arguments and by the demonstration of its geometrical possibility.", "2737": "Additional support is provided by the valid argument of Ch.", "2738": "22 and 23, that unless this were done, even if the observations were referred to the sun's mean position, the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Brahean deferent would be made eccentric, in directions exactly opposite to the sun's eccentricity.", "2739": "I have also promised stronger arguments, deduced from Brahe's own observations, for abandoning the sun's concentric, and in Ch.", "2740": "52 and 57 below I will produce them ^12.", "2741": "But it has already been proved here in Chapter 26 that this center of Mars's concentric (or the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) is found, not on an equal eccentric described about the center of the sun's point of uniform motion \u03c4, as Brahe along with the other authorities had believed, but on an eccentric described about \u03be, which is in the middle position between \u03b1 and \u03c4.\nTherefore, if the center of Mars's concentric goes around with the sun, it nevertheless goes around on an eccentric described about \u03be, and consequently the sun itself will go around on an eccentric described about \u03be. But its motion is uniform about \u03c4. Therefore, the sun's eccentricity \u03b1\u03c4 must be bisected at \u03be. For it is not likely that, although the centers of the concentrics of Mars and the sun go around in the same way, reach apogee at the same time, transpose their apogees in the same way, go slowly or quickly in the same way, and describe the same circumferences, their circles would nevertheless make different digressions from the earth in the same direction.", "2742": "Let it be enough for now, to present this form of demonstration in the three hypotheses.", "2743": "In what follows, whenever there is need of the same demonstration, I shall use Copernicus's form alone, it being simpler, so as not to be too long-winded.", "2744": "Now, in contrast, the industrious reader has seen how any of  these diagrams can be transformed into either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican form using parallel lines.", "2745": "Chapter 27", "2746": "From four other observations of the star Mars outside the acronychal situation but still in the same eccentric position, to demonstrate the eccentricity of the earth's orb, with its aphelion and the ratio of the orbs at that place, together with the eccentric position of Mars on the zodiac.", "2747": "Hitherto we have almost exclusively used the aphelion of Mars, along with the correction of the mean motion and the hypothesis of the equations found above.", "2748": "If these should err by a single minute in defining the planet's zodiacal longitude, as can easily happen, this creates considerable difficulty for us in the present undertaking.", "2749": "So now, at this point, we shall take for granted nothing whatever except Mars's periodic time, concerning which there can be no doubt, and the sun's zodiacal positions from Tycho's calculation.", "2750": "We shall also, I grant, assume an eccentric position, as is the common procedure in demonstrations leading to an impossibility, but we shall test that very position using repeated suppositions.", "2751": "These are the observations.", "2752": "Since in 1589 there is but a single day that can be related to the others, and nothing else was observed for a long time before and after, let us refer the other times to this one.", "2753": "The catalog of them, along with the apparent positions of the sun and Mars, and with the eccentric position of Mars, is this: 1", "2754": "Let the diagram be made as before, with \u03b1 the sun, \u03b2 the center of the earth's eccentric, \u03b6, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 the four positions of the earth, \u03b7 the position of Mars on its eccentric, and let each point be connected with all the others.", "2755": "Now, from the data,",

angles, too, will be given.", "2764": "Since these angles didn't quite come out equal, I made a second trial with \u03b1\u03b7's sidereal position moved forward 2'.", "2765": "And I found

half of 3600, and would doubtless obtain exactly that if we had the apogee perfectly.", "2782": "Still, it should be noted that if we suppose that the earth's path is not a perfect circle, but is narrower at the sides, \u03b1\u03b7 comes out here to be a little less than 163,100.", "2783": "And then, with 1\u00bd\u2019 subtracted from the eccentric position, and taking the value 1800 for the earth's eccentricity and 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn as the aphelion, the following apparent positions are produced:", "2784": "This supposition also agrees with my observations of 1604 February 29/ March

observations; and it could deviate somewhat in the intermediate positions between observations.", "2794": "Besides, it helps us to have  at hand various methods of demonstration by which to explore carefully the distances of Mars at all places throughout the entire circle.", "2795": "Accordingly, a new form of demonstration will follow here.", "2796": "The observations are these.", "2797": "When

And 91\u00b0 1' 53\" of mean anomaly shows you a distance of 99,984.", "2922": "But that was the magnitude of \u03b4\u03b2\u03b6 above.", "2923": "Nor was the mean anomaly there, for it was \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6, which is still greater.", "2924": "So the former mean anomaly of 91\u00b0 1\u2019 53\" had generated a longer distance there than a mean anomaly of the same magnitude, 91\u00b0 1\u2019 53\", shows here.", "2925": "All this, I say, is true.", "2926": "But there is no reason why you should be brought up short.", "2927": "For since we are considering differences of one degree, you see that the distances within one degree vary no more than 31 parts in one hundred thousand.", "2928": "Therefore, there would be no perceptible error, even if what has been done were to be out of the proper order.", "2929": "Below, in Ch.", "2930": "44 and the following, by analogy with the rest of the planets, you will find the reason for adapting this arrangement to the theory of the sun as well.", "2931": "Therefore, this is not out of order, but perfectly correct, because it concerns the qualitative nature of the figure that the planet describes, which has been substituted.", "2932": "As regards the quantity of the figure, the cure is excessive.", "2933": "The equated anomaly of 88\u00b0 58\u2019 7\", to which corresponds a mean anomaly of 91\u00b0 1' 53\", ought not to show a value of 99,984, but 100,000, which is the mean between the distances of the figure and of the table.", "2934": "The reason for this assertion must be postponed until Ch.", "2935": "55 and the following.", "2936": "It was just said, however, that we shall not err perceptibly if we err by 31 units.", "2937": "It will therefore hurt us much less perceptibly if we err by only half that, or 16 units.", "2938": "So for the time being we safely admit this small error, in order to accommodate ourselves to an understanding of what has been advanced in the reading so far, and to avoid appearing to presuppose what was to be demonstrated.", "2939": "Chapter 31", "2940": "That the bisection of the sun's eccentricity does not perceptibly alter the equations of the sun set out by Tycho; and concerning four ways of computing them.", "2941": "But lest there remain any suspicions preventing our moving onwards, we shall investigate, in the usual Ptolemaic form of the first inequality,*  whether there be any difference in the solar equations consequent upon the now bisected eccentricity.", "2942": "First let there be an unbisected eccentricity of 3600 on the line of apsides AF, with CE and CD accordingly radii of the orb; and let the anomaly FAE be 45\u00b0, and FAD 135\u00b0.", "2943": "Now it is obvious that, however great the discrepancy may be, it will reach its maximum around these positions of anomaly.", "2944": "For in the middle elongations the equations come out exactly the same, since [an eccentricity of] 3600, when investigated in both the sines and tangents", "2945": "1 produces the same arc.", "2946": "Therefore, as the radius CE is to the sine of the angle CAE or CAD, so is the eccentricity CA to the equation CEA or CDA, which are both 1\u00b0 27' 31\".", "2947": "And in this first way, Ptolemy computed the equations of the sun, and, following Ptolemy, Copernicus; and, following both, Brahe: each of them using only the eccentricity AC, whose magnitude they found through their observations.", "2948": "There now follows a second way of computing the same equations, of which Ptolemy made use in the other planets, and of which I should make use.", "2949": "For I have demonstrated in this third part that the center of the eccentric is not at the point C, the center of uniform motion, but at B, the midpoint between the center of the world A and the point of uniformity C.", "2950": "Therefore let CA be bisected at B, and let EB, BD, be the radius of the orb.", "2951": "By the same method, the part of the equation BDA, BEA, will be 0\u00b0 43' 46\", which, added to EAB, DAB, will result in an angle EBC of 45\u00b0 43' 46\", and DBC, of 135\u00b0 43' 46\".", "2952": "As a result, from the sides and the included angle, BEC comes out to be 43' 38\", and BDC 43' 42\".", "2953": "Thus the whole angle CEA is 1\u00b0 27' 24\", and CDA is 1\u00b0 27' 28\", within a hair's breadth of the previous value.", "2954": "And so, in the appendix to Tycho Brahe's Progymnasmata p.", "2955": "821, where the difference of the two calculations is given as 1\u2159\u2019, you should read \u2159\u20192.", "2956": "And this is in accord with the conclusions of Ch.", "2957": "4 applied to the form of the vicarious hypothesis.", "2958": "And since you may observe that in this particular form of Ptolemaic hy", "2959": "pothesis the parts of the equation are nearly equal (for the optical part was 43' 46\" and the physical part was 43' 38\" at E and 43' 42\" at D), you see why, in the construction of the table in the preceding chapter, all I did was double the equation to establish the total equation.", "2960": "And this is the third way of computing the sun's equations.", "2961": "For at apogee and perigee both parts of the equation vanish, and in the middle elongations the parts are again equal, as was just now said.", "2962": "Therefore, since these three ways of computing the equations clearly coincide in eight places distributed about the entire circle, they will perceptibly coincide everywhere.", "2963": "This is a result of the smallness of the eccentricity: if it", "2964": "were greater, this coincidence would not take place everywhere.", "2965": "Now I shall prepare myself for finding yet a fourth way to the equation,", "2966": "to be computed not through an arbitrary hypothesis but from the very nature of things, in eight chapters.", "2967": "Accordingly, this fourth way can finally follow in Chapter 40.", "2968": "Chapter 32", "2969": "The power that moves the planet in a circle diminishes with removal from its source.", "2970": "I have said above that Ptolemy, well informed by the observations, bisected the eccentricities of the three superior planets, that Copernicus imitated this, and that Tycho's observations of Mars also urge the same conclusion, as has been seen in Chapters 19 and 20, and will appear with much greater certainty below in Chapter 42.", "2971": "In addition, Tycho closely imitated this in his lunar theory.", "2972": "And now the same thing has been demonstrated in the theory of the sun (for Tycho) or of the earth (for Copernicus).", "2973": "Further, there is nothing to prevent our believing the same of Venus and Mercury.", "2974": "Indeed, I now take it as proven that this is the origin of the belief that the centers of these planets' eccentrics move around on a small annual circle.", "2975": "Therefore all planets have this [double eccentricity].", "2976": "Now in my Mysterium cosmographicum, published eight years ago,*  I postponed arguing this case of the cause of the Ptolemaic equant for the sole reason that it could not be said on the basis of ordinary astronomy whether the sun or earth uses an equalizing point and has its eccentricity bisected.", "2977": "However, now that we have the confirmation of a sounder astronomy, it should be transparently clear that there is indeed an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.", "2978": "And, I say, now that this is demonstrated, it is proper to accept as true and legitimate the cause to which I assigned the Ptolemaic equant in the Mysterium cosmographicum, since it is universal and common to all the planets.", "2979": "So in this part of the work I shall make a further declaration of that cause.", "2980": "And since the declaration will be general, I shall use the word, \"planet\".", "2981": "However, in this and the next few chapters, the reader may always understand by this, in particular, the earth for Copernicus or the sun for Tycho.", "2982": "First, the reader should know that in every hypothesis constructed according to this Ptolemaic form, however great the eccentricity, the speed at perihelion and slowness at aphelion are very closely proportional to the lines drawn from the center of the world to the planet.", "2983": "In the diagram of Chapter 29, in which \u03b1 was the center of the world, \u03b2 was the center of the eccentric \u03b4\u03b5, and \u03b3 was the point of the equant, let the equant circle \u03c5\u03c6 be described about center \u03b3, with radius equal to \u03b2\u03b4.", "2984": "And through the center of the world \u03b1, from which the eccentricity is reckoned (and in the business at hand, it is the sun for Copernicus and the earth for the others), let the straight line \u03c8\u03c9 be drawn, intersecting the eccentric at \u03c8 and \u03c9, so that the planet is at \u03c8 and \u03c9, having traversed the arcs of the eccentric \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9, from apogee or aphelion and from perigee  or perihelion, respectively.", "2985": "It is supposed that these arcs appear equal from \u03b1, since the straight line \u03c8\u03c9 makes the vertical angles \u03c8\u03b1\u03b4 and \u03c9\u03b1\u03b5, which are equal.", "2986": "But since \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 are taken as minimal arcs, as if at the apsides \u03b4 and \u03b5, they do not differ perceptibly from straight lines.", "2987": "And so, just as \u03b4\u03b1\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03b1\u03c9 were rectilinear triangles, with right angles at \u03b4 and \u03b5, and a common vertex \u03b1, \u03b4\u03b1 will be to \u03b5\u03b1 as arc \u03b4\u03c8 is to arc \u03b5\u03c9.", "2988": "But \u03b1\u03b4 is longer than \u03b1\u03b5.", "2989": "Therefore, arc \u03b4\u03c8 is longer than \u03b5\u03c9.", "2990": "These arcs, which are in fact unequal, appear equal from \u03b1. The question now is, how much time will the planet take to traverse each arc, according to Ptolemy's theory and hypothesis, when it has an equant?", "2991": "So let straight lines be drawn from the center \u03b3 through the points \u03c8 and \u03c9, intersecting the equant at \u03c7, \u03c4. Now Ptolemy will say, \"since the whole circle of the equant \u03c5\u03c6 denotes the periodic time of the planet, then \u03c5\u03c7 is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric \u03c8\u03b4, and \u03c6\u03c4 is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric \u03b5\u03c9.\"", "2992": "And now I myself say that \u03c5\u03c7, thus designated as the arc of the time (as Ptolemy wished) is to the arc \u03b4\u03c8 which the planet traverses, very nearly as \u03b1\u03b4, the distance of the arc \u03b4\u03c8 from the center of the world, is to \u03b4\u03b2 the mean distance of the points \u03c0 and \u03c1 from \u03b1. And likewise, the arc of the time \u03c6\u03c4 is to the arc of the planet's motion \u03b5\u03c9, approximately as \u03b1\u03b5, the distance of the arc \u03b5\u03c9 from the center of the world \u03b1 is to \u03b5\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03c0, the mean distance from the center of the world, which may be found at the points \u03c0 and \u03c1. And now, as before, as \u03b3\u03c5 is to \u03b3\u03b4 so is \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8, and as \u03b3\u03c6 is to \u03b3\u03b5 so is \u03c6\u03c4 to \u03b5\u03c9.", "2993": "But \u03b3\u03c5 is to \u03b3\u03b4 very nearly as \u03b2\u03b4 (or \u03b3\u03c5) is to \u03b1\u03b4, and this is shown by the fact that \u03b2\u03b4 is the arithmetic mean between \u03b3\u03b4 and \u03b1\u03b4, since Ptolemy makes \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b2\u03b3 equal.", "2994": "And further, the arithmetic mean between two terms whose ratio is near equality is only imperceptibly greater than the geometric mean.", "2995": "For example, the arithmetic mean between 10 and 12 is 11, and the geometric mean is about 1019/20, so that there is less than the twentieth part of a unit between the two means.", "2996": "Nevertheless, these numbers are of the order of the eccentricity of Mars, which according to Ptolemy has the greatest eccentricity of all the planets.", "2997": "And therefore, since the ratio \u03b3\u03c5 to \u03b3\u03b4 is imperceptibly greater than the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2, \u03c7\u03c5 will also have to \u03c8\u03b4 a ratio imperceptibly greater than \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2.", "2998": "Likewise, as \u03b3\u03b5 is to \u03b3\u03c6, so is \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4, but \u03b3\u03b5 is to \u03b3\u03c6 approximately as \u03b5\u03b2 is to \u03b1\u03b5; that is, the former ratio is only imperceptibly less than the latter.", "2999": "Therefore, too, the ratio \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4 is only imperceptibly smaller than the ratio \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5.", "3000": "Now let us permute the ratios.", "3001": "For the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 is imperceptibly less than the ratio \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5 to \u03b5\u03b1, seeing that \u03b2\u03b4 or \u03b2\u03b5 is the arithmetic mean between \u03b1\u03b4 and \u03b1\u03b5, as before.", "3002": "But it was proved that the ratio \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 is greater than the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2, from the smaller pair, and the ratio \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4 is less than the ratio \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5,  from the greater pair, so that in the two ratios \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 and \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5, the amount by which the former terms will be greater and the latter smaller is, in the two ratios \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4, the same as the amount by which the former is greater and the latter smaller.", "3003": "Consequently, there is some compensation even for that imperceptible difference, so that it is much more nearly true that the ratio of \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 is equal within a hair's breadth to the ratio of \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4.", "3004": "Therefore, the arcs \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being taken as equal (which hitherto were unequal), either \u03b4\u03c8 or \u03b5\u03c9 will be a mean proportional between \u03c5\u03c7, the increment of time at aphelion, and \u03c6\u03c4, the increment of time at perihelion.", "3005": "Consequently, the ratio \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03c6\u03c4 (\u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being equal) will be in the duplicate ratio of \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5 to \u03b5\u03b1, the former smaller and the latter greater by an imperceptible difference.", "3006": "But since the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5 is also the duplicate of either of these (for it is compounded of the two, which are nearly equal, taking the arithmetic mean \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5), therefore, the arcs on the eccentric \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being equal, the ratio of the times \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03c6\u03c4 will be equal to the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5.", "3007": "Or, more clearly, the planet takes a proportionally longer time to traverse some particular eccentric arc at \u03b4 than to traverse an equal eccentric arc at \u03b5, according as \u03b1\u03b4 is greater than \u03b1\u03b5.", "3008": "And this follows from the way the Ptolemaic form*  is ordered, and from its equalizing point, by means of a proof that is certain and valid so far as it concerns points near apogee and perigee.", "3009": "At other points there appears a very small discrepancy, which is all the smaller in effect the more obvious it is in the demonstration.", "3010": "This is because (for example) the ratio \u03b1\u03bc to \u03b1\u03bd is smaller, and the ratio \u03b1\u03b8 to \u03b1\u03b9 is much smaller, than \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5, the greatest ratio, where the effect is also greatest.", "3011": "Chapter 33", "3012": "The power that moves the planets resides in the body of the sun", "3013": "It was demonstrated in the previous chapter that the increments of time of a planet on equal parts of the eccentric circle (or on equal distances in the aethereal air) are in the same ratio to each other as the distances of those same spaces from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned; or, more simply, to the extent that a planet is farther from the point that is taken as the center of the world, it is less strongly urged to move about that point.", "3014": "It is therefore necessary that the cause of this weakening is either in the very body of the planet, and in a motive force placed therein, or right at the supposed center of the world.", "3015": "Now it is an axiom of the most common application in all of natural philosophy that of those things which occur at the same time and in the same manner, and which are always subject to like measurements, either one is the cause of the other or both are effects of the same cause.", "3016": "Just so, in this instance, the intension and remission of motion is always in the same ratio as the approach and recession from the center of the world.", "3017": "Thus, either that weakening will be the cause of the star's motion away from the center of the world, or the motion away will be the cause of the weakening, or both will  have some cause in common.", "3018": "But no one can think up some third concurrent thing that would be the common cause of these two, and in the following chapters it will become clear that we have no need of feigning any such cause, since the two are sufficient in themselves.", "3019": "Further, it is not in accord with nature that strength or weakness in longitudinal motion should be the cause of distance from the center.", "3020": "For distance from the center is prior both in thought and in nature to longitudinal motion.", "3021": "Indeed, longitudinal motion is never independent of distance from the center, since it requires a space in which to be performed, while distance from the center can be conceived without motion.", "3022": "Therefore, distance will be the cause of intensity of motion, and a greater or lesser distance will result in a greater or lesser amount of time.", "3023": "And since distance belongs to the class of related things, whose being depends upon end points, while relation itself, without respect to end points, has no efficacy, it therefore follows (as has been said) that the cause of the variation of intensity of motion inheres in one or the other of the end points.", "3024": "Now the body of a planet is never by itself made heavier in receding, nor lighter in approaching.", "3025": "Moreover, that an animate force, which is seated in the mobile body of the planet and imparts a motion to the heavenly body, undergoes intension and remission so many times without ever becoming tired or growing old,\u2014this will surely be absurd to say.", "3026": "Also, it is impossible to understand how this animate force could carry its body through the spaces of the world, since there are no solid orbs, as Tycho Brahe has proved.", "3027": "And on the other hand, a round body lacks such aids as wings or feet, by the moving of which the soul might carry its body through the aethereal air as birds do in the atmosphere, by some kind of pressure upon, and counter-pressure from, that air ^1.", "3028": "Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cause of this weakening and intension resides in the other endpoint, namely, in that point that is taken to be the center of the world, from which the distances are measured.", "3029": "So now, if the distance of the center of the world from the body of a planet  governs its slowness, and approach governs its speeding up, it is a necessary consequence that the source of motive power is at that supposed center of the world.", "3030": "And with this laid down, the manner in which the cause operates will also be clear.", "3031": "For it gives us to understand that the planets are moved rather in the manner of the steelyard or lever.", "3032": "For if the planet is moved with greater difficulty (and hence more slowly) by the power at the center when it is farther from the center, it is just as if I were to say that where the weight is farther from the fulcrum, it is thereby rendered heavier, not of itself, but by the power of the arm supporting it at that distance.", "3033": "And this is true, both of the steelyard or lever, and of the motion of the planets: that the weakening of power is in the ratio of the distances.", "3034": "But which body is it that is at the center?", "3035": "Is there none, as for Copernicus  when he is computing, and for Tycho in part?", "3036": "Is it the earth, as for Ptolemy and for Tycho in part?", "3037": "Or finally, is it the sun itself, as I, and Copernicus when he is speculating, would have it?", "3038": "This question I began to discuss in physical terms in Part 1.", "3039": "I there supposed as one of the principles what has now been expressly and geometrically proved in Chapter 32: that a planet is  moved less vigorously when it recedes from the point whence the eccentricity is computed.", "3040": "From this principle I presented a probable argument that the sun, rather than being at some other point occupied by no body, is at that point and at the center of the world (or the earth for Ptolemy).", "3041": "Allow me, then, to repeat that same probable argument, our foundation [for it] now demonstrated, in the present chapter.", "3042": "Then, you may remember, I demonstrated in the second part, that the phenomena at either end of the night follow beautifully if we reckon the oppositions of Mars according to the sun's apparent position.", "3043": "If this is done, then at the same time we set up the eccentricity and the distances from the very center of the sun's body, with the result that the sun itself again comes to be at the center of the world (for Copernicus), or at least at the center of the planetary system (for Tycho).", "3044": "But of these two arguments, one depends upon physical probability, and the other proceeds from possibility to actuality.", "3045": "And so in the third place I have postponed, because of its conceptual difficulty, demonstrating from the observations that we cannot avoid referring Mars to the apparent position of the sun, and drawing the line of apsides, which bisects the eccentric, directly through the sun's body, unless perhaps we wish to allow an eccentric such as will by no means be in accord with the parallax of the annual orb.", "3046": "Anyone who cannot tolerate the delay may read about this in chapter 52, and then may carry on here afterwards.", "3047": "For there nothing is assumed but the bare observations.", "3048": "You will find a similar proof in Part 5, from considerations of latitudes.", "3049": "Therefore, with the sun belonging in the center of the system, the source of motive power, from what has now been demonstrated, belongs in the sun, since it too has now been found to be in the center of the world.", "3050": "But indeed, if this very thing which I have just demonstrated a posteriori (from the observations) by a rather long deduction, if, I say, I had taken this as something to be demonstrated a priori (from the worthiness and eminence of the sun), so that the source of the world's life (which is visible in the motion of the heavens) is the same as the source of the light which forms the adornment of the entire machine, and which is also the source of the heat by which everything grows, I think I would have deserved an equal hearing.", "3051": "Let Tycho Brahe himself, or anyone who prefers to follow his general hypothesis of the second inequality, consider by how close a likeness to the truth this physically elegant combination has for the most part been accepted (since for him, too, this substitution of the apparent position of the sun brings the sun back to the center of the planetary system) yet to some extent recoils from his hypothesis.", "3052": "For it is obvious from what has been said that only one of the following can be true: either the power residing in the sun, which moves all the planets, by the same action moves the earth as well; or the sun, together with the planets linked to it through its motive force, is borne about the earth by some power which is seated in the earth.", "3053": "Now Tycho himself destroyed the notion of real orbs, and I in turn have in this Third Part irrefutably demonstrated that there is an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.", "3054": "From this it follows that the motion of the sun itself (if it is moved) is intensified and remitted according as it is nearer or farther from the earth, and hence it would follow that the sun is moved by the earth.", "3055": "But if, on the other hand, the earth is in motion, it too will be moved by the sun  with greater or less velocity according as it is nearer or farther from it, while the power in the body of the sun remains perpetually constant.", "3056": "Between these two possibilities, therefore, there is no intermediate.", "3057": "I myself agree with Copernicus, and allow that the earth is one of the  planets.", "3058": "Now it is true that the same objection may be raised against Copernicus concerning the moon, that I raised against Tycho concerning the five planets; namely, that it appears absurd for the moon to be moved by the earth, and to be associated with it and bound to it as well, so that it too, as a secondary planet, is swept around the sun by the sun.", "3059": "Nevertheless, I prefer to allow one moon, akin to the earth in its corporeal disposition2 (as I have shown in the Optics3) to be moved by a power seated in the earth but extended towards the sun, as will be described a little later in Ch.", "3060": "37, than to ascribe to that same earth as well the motion of the sun and of all the planets bound to it.", "3061": "But let us carry on in our consideration of this motive power residing in  the sun, and let us now again observe its very close kinship with light.}", "3062": "Since the perimeters of similar regular figures, even of circles, are to one another as their semidiameters, therefore as \u03b1\u03b4 is to \u03b1\u03b5, so is the circumference of the circle described about \u03b1 through \u03b4 to the circumference of the circle described about the same point \u03b1 through \u03b5. But as \u03b1\u03b4 is to \u03b1\u03b5, so is the strength of the power at \u03b5 to the strength of the power at \u03b4, inversely, by what was proved in Chapter 32.", "3063": "Therefore, as the circle at \u03b4 is to the smaller circle at \u03b5, so, inversely, is the power at \u03b5 to the power at \u03b4; that is, the power is weaker to the extent that it is more spread out, and stronger to the extent that it is more concentrated.", "3064": "Hence we understand that there is the same power in the whole circumference of the circle through \u03b4 as there is in the circumference of the smaller circle through \u03b5. This was shown to be true of light in exactly the same way in the Astronomiae pars optica, Chapter 1 ^4.", "3065": "Therefore, in all respects and in all its attributes, the motive power from the sun coincides with light.", "3066": "And although this light of the sun cannot be the moving power itself, I leave it to others to see whether light perhaps is equivalent to a kind of instrument or vehicle, of which the moving power makes use.", "3067": "This seems gainsaid by the following: first, light is hindered by opaque things, and therefore if the moving power had light as a vehicle, rest of the moving bodies would follow upon darkness; again, light spreads spherically in straight lines, while the moving power, though spreading in straight lines, does so circularly; that is, it is exerted in but one region of the world, from east  to west, and not the opposite, not at the poles, and so on.", "3068": "But we shall perhaps be able to reply to these objections in the chapters immediately following.", "3069": "Finally, since there is just as much power in a larger and more distant circle as there is in a smaller and closer one, nothing of this power is lost in travelling from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the movable body.", "3070": "The emission, then, in the same manner as light, is immaterial, unlike odours, which are accompanied by a diminution of substance, and unlike heat from a hot furnace, or anything similar which fills the intervening space.", "3071": "The remaining possibility, then, is that, just as light, which lights the whole earth, is an immaterial species5 of that fire which is in the body of the sun, so this power which enfolds and bears the bodies of the planets, is an immaterial species residing in the sun itself, possessing inestimable strength, seeing that it is the primary activity of every motion in the universe.", "3072": "Since, therefore, this species of the power, exactly as the species of light (for which see the Astronomiae pars optica Ch.", "3073": "16), cannot be considered as dispersed throughout the intermediate space between the source and the mobile body, but is seen as collected in the body in proportion to the amount of the circumference the mobile body occupies, this power (or species) will therefore not be any geometrical body, but is like a variety of surface, just as light is.", "3074": "To generalize this, the species of things that emanate immaterially are not by that emanation extended through the dimensions of a body, although they arise from a body (as this one does from the body of the sun).", "3075": "Instead, they are extended according to that very law of emission: they are not bounded by the emanation itself, but just as the surfaces of things to be illuminated cause light to be considered as a kind of surface, because they receive and terminate its emission, so the bodies of things that are moved appear to bring it about that this moving power be considered as if a sort of geometrical body, because their whole masses terminate or receive this emission of the motive species, so that the species can exist or subsist nowhere in the world but in the bodies of the mobile things themselves.", "3076": "And, exactly like light, between the source and the movable thing it does not exist, but will have a quasi-existence.", "3077": "Moreover, at the same time, a reply can be made here to a possible objection.", "3078": "For it was said above that this motive power is extended throughout the space of the world, in some places more spread out and in others more concentrated, and that the intensification and remission of the motions of the planets are consequent upon this variation.", "3079": "Now, however, it has been said that this power is an immaterial species of its source, and never inheres in anything except a mobile subject, such as the body of a planet.", "3080": "But these appear to be contradictory: to lack matter and yet to be subject to geometrical dimensions; to be poured out throughout the whole world, and yet not to exist anywhere but where there is something movable.", "3081": "The reply is this: although the motive power is not anything material, nevertheless, since it is designed for carrying matter (namely, the body of a planet), it is not free from geometrical laws, at least on account of this material action of carrying things about.", "3082": "Nor is there need for more, for we see that those motions are carried out in space and time, and that this power arises and emanates from the source through the space of the world, all of which are geometrical entities.", "3083": "So this power should indeed be subject to other geometrical necessities.", "3084": "But lest I appear to philosophize with excessive insolence, I shall propose  to the reader the clearly authentic example of light, since it also makes its nest  in the sun, thence to break forth into the whole world as a companion to this motive power.", "3085": "Who, I ask, will say that light is something material?", "3086": "Nevertheless, it carries out its operations with respect to place, suffers alteration,7 is reflected and refracted, and assumes quantities so as to be dense or rare, and to be capable of being taken as a surface wherever it falls upon something illuminable.", "3087": "Now just as it is said in optics, light too, and this motive power as well, does not exist in the intermediate space between the source and the illuminable, even though it passed through it, but quasi-existed there.", "3088": "Moreover, although light itself does indeed flow forth in no time, while this power creates motion in time, nonetheless the way in which both do so is the same, if you consider them correctly.", "3089": "Light manifests those things which are proper to it instantaneously, but so far as it is connected with matter, it too requires time.", "3090": "It illuminates a surface in a moment, because here matter need not undergo any alteration, for all illumination takes place according to surfaces, or at least as if a property of surfaces and not as a property of corporeality as such.", "3091": "On the other hand, light bleaches colors in time, since here it acts upon matter qua matter, making it hot and expelling the contrary cold which is embedded in the body's matter and is not on its surface.", "3092": "In precisely the same manner, this moving power perpetually and without any interval of time is present from the sun wherever there is a suitable movable body, for it receives nothing from the movable body to cause it to be there.", "3093": "On the other hand, it causes motion in time, since the movable body is material.", "3094": "Or if it seems better, frame the comparison in this manner: light is  constituted for illumination, and it is just as certain that power is constituted for motion.", "3095": "Light does everything that can be done to achieve the greatest illumination; nonetheless, it does not happen that color is most greatly illuminated.", "3096": "For color intermingles its own peculiar species with the illumination of light, thus forming some third entity.", "3097": "In like manner, there is no slowing in the moving power to prevent the planet's having as much speed as it has itself, but the planet's speed is not therefore that great, since something intervening prevents that, namely, some sort of matter possessed by the surrounding aether, or the disposition of the movable body itself to rest (others might say, \"weight,\" but I do not entirely approve of that, except, indeed, where the earth is concerned).", "3098": "It is the tempering effect of these, together with the weakening of the motive power, that determines a planet's periodic time.", "3099": "Chapter 34", "3100": "The body of the sun is magnetic, and rotates in its space.", "3101": "Concerning that power that is closely attached to the bodies of the planets and pulls them, we have already said how it is formed, how it is akin to light, and what it is in its metaphysical being.", "3102": "Next, we should contemplate the deeper nature of its source, shown by the outflowing species (acting as an archetype).", "3103": "For it may appear that there lies hidden in the body of the sun something divine, which may be compared to our soul, from which flows that species driving the planets around, just as from the soul of someone throwing pebbles a species of motion comes to inhere in the pebbles thrown by him, even when he who threw them removes his hand from them.", "3104": "And to those who proceed soberly, other reflections will soon be provided.", "3105": "Now because the power that is extended from the sun to the planets moves  them in a circular course around the immovable body of the sun, this cannot happen, or be conceived in thought, in any other way than this, that the power traverses the same path along which it carries the other planets.", "3106": "This has been observed to some extent in catapults and all violent motions.", "3107": "Thus, Fracastoro and others, relying on a story told by the most ancient Egyptians, spoke with little probability when they said that perchance some of the planets, their orbits being deflected gradually beyond the poles of the world, would thus afterwards move in a path opposite to the rest and to their modern course ^1.", "3108": "For it is much more likely that the bodies of the planets are always borne in that direction in which the power emanating from the sun tends.", "3109": "But this species is immaterial, proceeding from its body out to this distance without the passing of any time, and is in all other respects like light.", "3110": "Therefore, it is not only required by the nature of the species, but likely in itself owing to this kinship with light, that along with the particles of its body or source it too is divided up, and when any particle of the solar body moves towards some part of the world, the particle of the immaterial species that from the beginning of creation corresponded to that particle of the body also always moves towards the same part.", "3111": "If this were not so, it would not be a species, and would come down from the body not in straight but in curved lines.", "3112": "Since the species is moved in a circular course, in order thereby to confer motion upon the planets, the body of the sun, or source, must move with it, not, of course, from space to space in the world\u2014for I have said, with Copernicus, that the body of the sun remains in the center of the world\u2014but upon its center or axis, both immobile, its parts moving from place to place, while the whole body remains in the same place.", "3113": "In order that the force of the analogical argument may be that much more evident, I would like you to recall, reader, the demonstration in optics that vision occurs through the emanation of small sparks of light2 toward the eye from the surfaces of the seen object.", "3114": "Now imagine that some orator in a great crowd of people, encircling him in an orb,3 turns his face, or his whole body along with it, once around.", "3115": "Those of the audience to whom he turns his eyes directly also see his eyes, but those who stand behind him then lack the view of his eyes.", "3116": "But when he turns himself around, he turns his eyes around to everyone in the orb.", "3117": "Therefore, in a very short interval of time, all get a glimpse of his eyes.", "3118": "This they get by the arrival of a small spark of light or species of color descending from the eyes of the orator to the eyes of the spectators.", "3119": "Thus by turning his eyes around in the small space in which his head is located, he carries around along with it the rays of the spark of light in the very large  orb in which the eyes of the spectators all around are situated.", "3120": "For unless the spark of light went around, his spectators would not be recipients of his eyes' glance.", "3121": "Here you see clearly that the immaterial species of light either is moved around or stands still along with that of which it is the species either moving or standing still ^4.", "3122": "Therefore, since the species of the source, or the power moving the planets, rotates about the center of the world, I conclude with good reason, following this example, that that of which it is the species, the sun, also rotates.", "3123": "However, the same thing is also shown by the following argument.", "3124": "Motion that is local and subjected to time cannot inhere in a bare immaterial species, since such a species is incapable of receiving an effect of an applied motion unless the received motion is non-temporal, just as the power is immaterial.", "3125": "Also, although it has been proved that this moving power rotates, it cannot be allowed to have infinite speed (for then it would seem that the power will also impart infinite speed to the bodies), and therefore it completes its rotation in some period of time.", "3126": "Therefore, it cannot carry out this motion by itself, and it is as a consequence necessary that it is moved only because the body upon which it depends is moved.", "3127": "By the same argument, it appears to be a correct conclusion that there does not exist within the boundaries of the solar body anything immaterial by whose rotation the species descending from that immaterial something also rotates.", "3128": "For again, local motion which takes time is not correctly attributed to anything immaterial.", "3129": "It therefore remains that the body of the sun itself rotates in the manner described above, indicating the poles of the zodiac by the  poles of its rotation (by a line extended from the center of the body to the fixed stars through the poles), and indicating the ecliptic by the greatest circle of its body, thus furnishing a natural cause for these astronomical entities.", "3130": "Further, we see that the individual planets are not carried along with equal  swiftness at every distance from the sun, nor is the speed of all of them at their various distances equal.", "3131": "For Saturn takes 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 23 months, earth 12, Venus 8\u00bd, and Mercury 3.", "3132": "Nevertheless, it follows from what has been said that every orb of power emanating from the sun (in the space embraced by the lowest, Mercury, as well as that embraced by the highest, Saturn) is twisted around with a whirl equal to that which spins the solar body, with an equal period.", "3133": "(There is nothing absurd in this statement, for the emanating power is immaterial, and by its own nature would be capable of infinite speed if it were possible to impress a motion upon it from elsewhere, for then it could be impeded neither by weight, which it lacks, nor by the obstruction of the corporeal medium.)", "3134": "It is consequently clear that the planets are ill-suited to emulate the swiftness of the motive power.", "3135": "For Saturn is less receptive than Jupiter, since its returns are slower, while the orb of power at the path of Saturn returns with the same swiftness as the orb of power at the path of Jupiter, and so on in order, all the way to Mercury, which, by example of the superior planets, doubtless will move more slowly than the power that pulls it.", "3136": "It is therefore necessary that the nature of the planetary globes be material, from an inherent property, arising from the origin of things, to be inclined to rest or  to the privation of motion ^5.", "3137": "When the tension between these things leads to a fight, that planet which is placed in a weaker power overcomes it more, and is moved more slowly by it; that which is closer to the sun overcomes it less.", "3138": "This analogy shows that there is in all planets, even in the lowest, Mercury, a material force of disengaging itself somewhat from the orb of the sun\u2019s power.", "3139": "From this it is concluded that the rotation of the solar body anticipates  considerably the periodic times of all the planets; therefore, it must rotate in its space at least faster than once in a three-months\u2019 span.", "3140": "However, in my Mysterium Cosmographicum I pointed out that there is about the same ratio between the semidiameters of the sun\u2019s body and the orb of Mercury as there is between the semidiameters of the body of the earth and the orb of the moon.", "3141": "Hence, you may plausibly conclude that the period of the orb of Mercury would have the same ratio to the period of the body of the sun as the period of the orb of the moon has to the period of the body of the earth.", "3142": "And the semidiameter of the orb of the moon is sixty times the semidiameter of the body of the earth, while the period of the orb of the moon (or the month) is a little less than thirty times the period of the body of the earth (or day), and thus the ratio of the distances is double the ratio of the periodic times.", "3143": "Therefore, if the doubled ratio also holds for the sun and Mercury, since the diameter of the sun's body is about one sixtieth of the diameter of Mercury's orb, the time of rotation of the solar globe will be one thirtieth of 88 days, which is the period of Mercury's orb.", "3144": "Hence it is likely that the sun rotates in about three days.", "3145": "You may, on the other hand, prefer to prescribe the sun's diurnal period in such a way that the diurnal rotation of the earth is dispensed by the diurnal rotation of the sun, by some sort of magnetic force.", "3146": "I would certainly not object.", "3147": "Such a rapid rotation appears not to be alien to that body in which lies the first activation of every motion.", "3148": "This opinion (on the rotation of the solar body as the cause of the motion for the other planets) is beautifully confirmed by the example of the earth and the moon.", "3149": "For the chief, monthly motion of the moon, by the force of the demonstrations used in Chapters 32 and 33, is entirely derived from the earth as its source (for what the sun is for the rest of the planets there, the earth is for the moon in this demonstration).", "3150": "Consider, therefore, how our earth occasions the motion of the moon: while this our earth, and its immaterial species along with it, rotates twenty nine and one half times about its axis, at the moon this emitted species can drive it around only once in the same time, in (of course) the same direction in which the earth leads it.", "3151": "Here, by the way, is a marvel: in any given time the center of the moon traverses twice as long a line about the center of the earth as any place on the surface of the earth beneath the great circle of the equator.", "3152": "For if equal spaces were measured out in equal times, the moon ought to return in sixty days, since the size of its orb is sixty times the size of the earth's globe.", "3153": "This is surely because there is so much force in the immaterial species of the earth, while the lunar body is doubtless of great rarity and weak resistance.", "3154": "Thus, to remove your bewilderment, consider that on the principles we have supposed it would necessarily follow that if the moon were not to resist, by its material force, the motion impressed from outside by the earth, the moon would be carried at exactly the same speed as the earth's immaterial species, that is, with the earth itself, and  would complete its circuit in 24 hours, in which the earth also completes its circuit.", "3155": "For even if the tenuity of the earth's species is great at the distance of 60 semidiameters, the ratio of one to nothing is still the same as the ratio of sixty to nothing.", "3156": "Hence the immaterial species of the earth would prevail completely, if the moon did not resist.", "3157": "Here, one might inquire of me, what sort of body I consider the sun to be, from which this motive species descends.", "3158": "I would ask him to proceed under the guidance of a further analogy, and urge him to inspect more closely the example of the magnet brought up a little earlier, whose power resides in the entire body of the magnet, grows with its mass, and is itself also divided when the magnet is diminished.", "3159": "So in the sun the moving power appears so much stronger that it seems likely that its body is of all [those in the world] the most dense.", "3160": "And the power of attracting iron is spread out in an orb from the magnet so  that there exists a certain orb within which iron is attracted, but more strongly so as the iron comes nearer into the embrace of that orb.", "3161": "In exactly the same way the power moving the planets is propagated from the sun in an orb, and is weaker in the more remote parts of the orb.", "3162": "The magnet, however, does not attract with all its parts, but has filaments  (so to speak) or straight fibers (seat of the motor power) extended throughout its length, so that is a little strip of iron is placed in a middle position between the heads of the magnet at the side, the magnet does not attract it, but only directs it parallel to its own fibers.", "3163": "Thus it is credible that there is in the sun no force whatever attracting the planets, as there is in the magnet, (for then they would approach the sun until they were quite joined with it), but only a directing force, and consequently that is has circular fibers all set up in the same direction, which are indicated by the zodiac circle", "3164": "Therefore, as the sun forever turns itself, the motive force or the outflowing of the species from the sun\u2019s magnetic fibers, diffused through all the distances of the planets, also rotates in an orb, and does so in the same time as the sun, just as when a magnet is moved about, the magnetic power is also moved, and the iron along with it, following the magnetic force.", "3165": "The example of the magnet I have hit upon is a very pretty one, and entirely  suited to the subject; indeed, it is little short of being the very truth.", "3166": "So why should I speak of the magnet as if it were an example?", "3167": "For, by the demonstration of the Englishman William Gilbert,6 the earth itself is a big magnet, and is said by the same author, a defender of Copernicus, to rotate once a day, just as I conjecture about the sun.", "3168": "And because of this very thing, that it has magnetic fibers intersecting the line of its motion at right angles, those fibers therefore lie in various circles about the poles of the earth parallel to its motion.", "3169": "I am therefore absolutely within my rights to state that the moon is carried along by the rotation of the earth and the motion of its magnetic power, only thirty times slower.", "3170": "I know that the earth\u2019s filaments and its motion indicate the equator, while  the circuit of the moon is generally related to the zodiac \u2013 on this point there will be more in Chapter 37 and Part 5.", "3171": "With this one exception, everything fits: the earth is intimately related to the lunar period, just as the sun is to that of  the other planets.", "3172": "And just as the planets are eccentric with respect to the sun, so is the moon with respect to the earth.", "3173": "So it is certain that the earth is looked upon by the moon\u2019s mover as a kind of pole star (so to speak), just as the sun is looked upon by the movers belonging to the rest of the planets, for which see Chapter 38.", "3174": "It is therefore plausible, since the earth moves the moon through its species and is a magnetic body, while the sun moves the planets similarly through an emitted species, that the sun is likewise a magnetic body.", "3175": "Chapter 35", "3176": "Whether the motion from the sun, like its light, is subject to privation in the planets through occultations ^1.", "3177": "This is a good time for me to take up the objections raised in Chapter 33, where to the kinship of light and motive power were opposed, first, the mutual occultations of the celestial bodies, and then, the different [manner of] emanation of the species of the two.", "3178": "And concerning the first, it is worthy of consideration whether, just as one opaque body intercepts another's sunlight, mobile bodies similarly impede one another in motion when they lie in line with the sun.", "3179": "If so, light would clearly be the vehicle or instrument of the motive power.", "3180": "It might appear that in order to avoid this as much as possible, God introduced the relative inclinations of all the eccentrics, deviations from the ecliptic, and transpositions of the nodes, as well as the proportions of the bodies and the attenuation of shadows in a cone.", "3181": "And since it would not be possible completely to prevent the stars' occasionally lining up with the sun, it is tempting  to suppose that the very slow motions of the apsides and nodes (which are, as it were, a kind of aberration of the epicycles from their periodic times) derive their origin thence.", "3182": "But it is answered, first, that the analogy between light and motive power is not to be disturbed by rashly confusing their properties.", "3183": "Light is impeded by the opaque, but is not impeded by a body, because light is light, and does not act upon the body but on the surface (or as if on the surface).", "3184": "Power acts upon the body without respect to its opacity.", "3185": "Therefore, since it is not correlated with the opaque, it will likewise not be impeded by the opaque.", "3186": "On this account I would nearly separate light from moving power, unless I were to come upon examples in nature which leave to the rays of light, even when impeded, a certain efficacy in those locations where their entry is prohibited.", "3187": "But I am not chiefly concerned here with the association of light with the motive power.", "3188": "Instead, in order to dissolve this suspicion that the motions are impeded, let us  take another example from the magnet.", "3189": "Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there.", "3190": "Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate.", "3191": "But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet.", "3192": "It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it.", "3193": "And although it is impeded by the interposition of the iron plate, this too belongs to the magnetic nature, and it immediately drinks up the magnet's power and uses it as if it were its own.", "3194": "Therefore, in order that we may deny that the motion of the celestial bodies is impeded by central conjunctions of two of them, we must say that the nature of the sun differs from the nature of the rest of the celestial bodies more than the nature of the magnet differs from the nature of iron.", "3195": "Also, we must deny that the planets drink up the power all at once from the sun in the same way as the iron drinks it from the magnet.", "3196": "The question of whether they drink up any of it at all, I defer to Chapter 57.", "3197": "In respect to the likelihood of the cause of the apogees' motion, it proves  nothing concerning this common solar power being impeded by occultation ^2.", "3198": "For the motion of the apogees could be quite different; for instance, it could have an animate origin.", "3199": "You will find a certain obscure opinion on this point below in Chapter 57 ^3.", "3200": "Further, if the motion of the apogees were to arise because the motion of the planets around the sun is impeded by the occultation of the motive species emanating from the sun, the motion in longitude would be slowed, either by a progressive motion of latitude (by which the apogees would move back) or equally by slowing of the latitudinal motion.", "3201": "Thus, the apogees would stand still, although the observations testify that they move forward.", "3202": "But the question whether, once the sun is preserved as the source of motion, the motions proper to the celestial bodies are impeded by occultation,4 will also be discussed in Chapter 57.", "3203": "Chapter 36", "3204": "By what measure the motive power from the sun is attenuated as it spreads through the world.", "3205": "There follows another, rather more difficult objection, arising from the second argument that was raised in Chapter 33 against the kinship of light and motive power, which seems irreconcilably at odds with our study of immaterial species.", "3206": "This objection wearied me for a long time without offering any prospect of solution.", "3207": "It was demonstrated in Chapter 32 that the intension and remission of the planets' motion is in simple proportion to the distances.", "3208": "It appears, however, that the power emanating from the sun should be intensified and remitted in the duplicate or triplicate ratio of the distances or lines of efflux.", "3209": "Therefore, the intension and remission of the planets' motion will not be a result of the attenuation of the power emanating from the sun.", "3210": "The logical consequence appears to be proved in the following manner, for light as well as for  moving power; however, discussions of light are clearer.", "3211": "The reader should read in \"motive power\".", "3212": "Initially, let \u03b1 be any point on the sun's body.", "3213": "It will therefore spread out its rays to every orb, and from a demonstration in optics, as the amplitude of the greater spherical surface \u03b3, considered as an imaginary terminus for those rays, is to the amplitude of the smaller, \u03b2, so will the density of light at the smaller orb \u03b2 be to its density at the greater \u03b3.", "3214": "Next, let \u03b4\u03b5 be any luminous great circle on the body of the sun.", "3215": "Thus its individual points, of which there are an infinity, spread out rays to the individual hemispheres \u03b2 and \u03b3 in the same ratio.", "3216": "And the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the circle at the shorter distance (i.e., the angle \u03b4\u03b2\u03b5) is to the apparent magnitude at the greater distance (i.e., the angle \u03b4\u03b3\u03b5), conversely, as the longer distance \u03b1\u03b3 from such a circular line (which at a distance appears straight) is to the shorter \u03b4\u03b2.", "3217": "So, since this diameter appears longer from the nearby point \u03b2 than from the distant point \u03b3, in the same ratio, while the radiation belonging to any given point is denser at a nearby point \u03b2 than at a distant point \u03b3, it is therefore apparent that the density of radiation of the circle at the nearby point \u03b2 will have to the density of radiation at the distant point \u03b3 the [inverse of the] duplicate ratio of \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b3.", "3218": "Thirdly, let \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 be the apparent disc of the sun's body, and since similar surfaces (as are the apparent circular discs here) are in the duplicate ratio of their diameters, while the apparent diameters of the sun are in the simple inverse ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b2, the circular discs will therefore appear in the duplicate ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b2.", "3219": "But since the radiation of the circle \u03b4\u03b5 at \u03b3 and \u03b2 was just proved to be in the duplicate ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b2,

respect to the density of light, and the apparent diameters of circles would be 1 at \u03b3 and 2 at \u03b2.", "3221": "Therefore, the radiation of the diameter of the circle \u03b4\u03b5 would be 1 at \u03b3 and 4 at \u03b2. But the discs are in the duplicate ratio of the diameters.", "3222": "Therefore the apparent magnitude of the disc at \u03b3 would be 1, and at \u03b2, 4, as if you were to say that the disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 when seen from \u03b2 appears to contain four times as many points as when seen from \u03b3. Any of these points illuminates twice as densely at \u03b2 than at \u03b3. Therefore, when the ratios are compounded, the density of radiation of the whole disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 at \u03b3 would have to the density of radiation of the whole disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 at \u03b2 the ratio 1 to 8.", "3223": "It does not trouble us here that we are reckoning from the sun's apparent disc, although it is a spherical surface.", "3224": "For the ratio of equally many things to each other mutually is the same.", "3225": "But the spherical surface was demonstrated by Archimedes to be four times the area of the greatest circle described in the sphere.", "3226": "Therefore, a body at \u03b3, twice as far away as at \u03b2, should have appeared to be fully eight times as obscurely illuminated at \u03b3 as at \u03b2, not just twice.", "3227": "For it seems that the brightness of the rays ought to be intensified because of the fact that bodies appear to be magnified when they approach, as [for example] Venus, when at the perigee of the epicycle, defines a more evident shadow around bodies than at apogee.", "3228": "Therefore, by the force of the analogy which we have instituted between light and motive force, the same should be thought to apply to the motive force.", "3229": "To this objection, I answer decisively, that in the initial supposition involving the point I made a false assumption.", "3230": "Even though I did indeed say something like that in the Optics, you should bear in mind that I was speaking of optics, whose points and lines are not quite indivisibles.", "3231": "For, as concerns the point, since it has no magnitude, while the rays are amplified with the magnitudes of bodies, it follows that the radiation of a point in itself is nothing, and hence what has no radiation has no greater or lesser density.", "3232": "Thus the initial assumption of the ratio of distances \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b3 collapses.", "3233": "Rather, because of this very thing, we say that any point shines more strongly or weakly to the extent that that point designates to us a greater or lesser quantity.", "3234": "In the second supposition, concerning the circle, and the third, concerning the disc, there are two false assumptions.", "3235": "The first is that a mathematical circle, lacking breadth, is supposed to shine.", "3236": "For it can no more shine itself than can the point from whose motion the circle is supposed to be generated.", "3237": "You are no closer to having a surface when you posit a line of three stadia1 than you are in positing a line of three feet.", "3238": "Second, it is supposed that the optical magnification of the diameter or of the disc adds to the strength of the rays, although this is but a deception of the visual faculty, and belongs to the genus of theoretical entities, which lack any efficacy.", "3239": "The physical identity of the circle \u03b4\u03b5, the surface \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 (when light is in question) and the body \u03b4\u03b5 (when power is in question) remains the same whether it is viewed from \u03b3 or from \u03b2, and will always act the same and have the same effect, spreading the same amount of power or light in the more diffuse orb \u03b3 as in the more compact orb \u03b2.

equivalence demonstrated in Chapter 2), as long as the diameter of the epicycle ND with the planet at D always remains parallel to AB with respect to its position in the world.", "3344": "Therefore,

planets is faster than any of them, as is shown in Chapter 34, we are here to suppose in our imagination a single ray of power AN  coming from the sun, as if there were a line upon which the center of

speed at the same distance.", "3348": "Moreover, we would be required to suppose that the  planet has its own rotatory motion away from this imaginary ray AN in the opposite direction, traversing unequal distances in equal times, according as this ray itself  were swifter or slower.", "3349": "In adopting this account, we would indeed approach more closely the geometrical suppositions of the

happen naturally.", "3352": "Now all this would be conceived more simply were we to consider the  diameter of the epicycle ND as always remaining parallel to itself.", "3353": "For then the planet would carry out its motion by a mental image, not of the epicycle, but of the center of the eccentric B, and by keeping itself always at the same distance from that center.", "3354": "But at the beginning of this work, in Chapter 2, it was said to be most  absurd that a planet (even if you give it a mind) may imagine for itself a center  and from it a distance, when in that center there is no particular body for the planet to be aware of.", "3355": "Now you might say that the planet observes the sun A, and already knows beforehand, through memory, which ordered distances from the sun a perfect eccentric would have to attain.", "3356": "But first, this is more indirect, and depends upon something intermediate connecting the effect of the perfectly circular path with the indication of the waxing and waning of the sun's diameter, and this too in some mind.", "3357": "But that intermediate can be nothing but the position of the center of the eccentric B at a certain distance from the sun, which, as has just now been said, cannot be known by an unassisted mind.", "3358": "I do not deny that a center can be conceived, and about it a circle.", "3359": "But I do  say this, that if the center is established by thought alone, without respect to time and without any external indication, it is impossible to set up about it, in reality, the perfectly circular path of some movable body.", "3360": "Besides, if the planet were to derive its correct distances from the sun,  ordained by the rule of the circle, from memory, it could also derive from memory the equal arcs of the eccentric which are to be traversed in unequal times, and which are to be traversed by an extrinsic force originating in the sun, as if it were obtaining the values right from the Prutenic or Alphonsine tables.", "3361": "Thus it would know from memory beforehand what this extrinsic and mindless power originating in the sun was going to do.", "3362": "All of these are absurd:\u2014", "3363": "Chiefly since, as Aristotle affirms, there is no knowledge of the infinite,  while the infinite is involved in this intension and remission.", "3364": "But it is all right, because even the observations themselves will not allow CD to be a perfect circle, below in Chapter 44, so these theoretical arguments, weak though they are thought to be, do not stand alone, and are that much the less vulnerable to scornful rejection.", "3365": "It is consequently more fitting that the planet itself require no assistance, whether of epicycle or eccentric, but rather that the task which it either performs by itself or has a part in performing is a reciprocating path along the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 directed towards the sun \u03b1.", "3366": "The question now is, what is the measure by which the planet metes out the correct distances for any given time?", "3367": "Now to us the measure is clear from geometry and the diagram.", "3368": "For whenever the solar power moves the planet forward to the line DA, we then find the angle CBD and make \u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 equal to it; and thus we say that \u03b1\u03b4, or \u03b1\u03b9 which is its equal, is the correct distance from A to the planet at D. But this measure which we have proposed for humans, we have just now denied the planet when we removed it from the circumference of the epicycle and restricted it to the straits of the diameter \u03b3\u03b6.", "3369": "Indeed, in this inquiry it is easier to say what is not the case than to say what is.", "3370": "This is because at the moments when the sun has placed the planet on the lines drawn from A through C, D, E, F, G, H, the planet itself is presumed to have produced the distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, respectively.", "3371": "Consequently, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, then to equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, correspond unequal descents of the planet along the diameter, namely, \u03b3\u03b9, \u03b9\u03bb, \u03bb\u03b6.", "3372": "Moreover, the order is perturbed: the highest is not the smallest, nor the lowest the greatest, but the middle parts \u03b9\u03bb are greatest, and the extremes \u03b3\u03b9  and \u03bb\u03b6 are smaller, and the highest \u03b3\u03b9 are a little smaller than the corresponding lowest, \u03bb\u03b6.", "3373": "For \u03b3\u03ba and \u03bc\u03b6 are equal, and \u03b3\u03b9 is smaller than \u03b3\u03ba, while \u03bb\u03b6 is greater than \u03bc\u03b6.", "3374": "Furthermore, this same cause prevents \u03b3\u03b9, \u03b9\u03bb, \u03bb\u03b6, being made proportional to either the times of the equal arcs traversed CD, DE, EF, or to the angles at the sun CAD, DAE, EAF.", "3375": "For the time or duration of the planet on equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, is continuously diminished from the highest to the lowest points, and the angles at the sun are continuously increased, but the reciprocations \u03b3\u03b9 are increased in the middle regions, such as \u03b9\u03bb.", "3376": "Therefore, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, the measure of the planet's descent on the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 is neither time, nor distance traversed on the eccentric, nor the angle at the sun.", "3377": "And physical theories, too, also decisively repudiate these measures.", "3378": "What, then, if we should say this: although the motion of the planet does  not take place on an epicycle, this reciprocation is measured out in such a way that distances from the sun are produced that are similar to those which exist in an epicycle actually traversed?", "3379": "First, this attributes to the power belonging to the planet a knowledge of the imaginary epicycle and of its effects in setting out distances from the sun; and further, it attributes knowledge of the future speed or slowness which the common motion from the sun is going to cause.", "3380": "For it is necessary to suppose here an imaginary intension and remission of motion on the imaginary epicycle that is the same as that of the motion on the real eccentric.", "3381": "This is more incredible than the previous accounts, where the motion of the body was combined with knowledge of the epicycle or eccentric.", "3382": "Therefore, the objections raised there should be understood as applying here as well, the judgements being nearly identical.", "3383": "Nevertheless, for want of a better opinion, we must at present put up with  this one.", "3384": "And as for its involving many absurdities, in Chapter 57 below, a certain physicist will quite readily allow this: that on the testimony of the observations the path of the planet is not a circle.", "3385": "So far, the discussion has concerned the measure relating to the form of  this reciprocation.", "3386": "It now remains for us to find the measure of this measure; that is, the measure of the quantity or of motion through place.", "3387": "For it is not enough for the planet to know how far it should be from the sun: it also has to know what to do in order to be at the correct distance.", "3388": "Now anyone who is so attracted to the supposition of a perfectly circular  orbit as to locate in the planet a mind which could preside over the reciprocation, can say only this: that this planetary mind observes the increasing and decreasing size of the solar diameter, and understands, using this as an indication, what distances from the sun it should cause to occur at any given time.", "3389": "For example, sailors cannot know from the sea itself how far they have travelled over the waters, since the course, viewed in that way, has no distinct limits.", "3390": "Instead, they find this either from the amount of time they have sailed, if wind and sea remain constant and the ship does not stop, or from the direction of the wind and the changing elevation of the pole, or from all or several of these in conjunction, or, may it please the gods, by a contrivance of a number of wheels, with paddles lowered into the water (for certain conceited mechanics are proposing an instrument of this sort, who ascribe the calm of the continents to the waves of the Ocean) ^2.", "3391": "In just the same way, the mind  of the planet cannot by itself measure its position, or the distance between itself and the sun, since between them there is pure aethereal air, devoid of any  means of indication.", "3392": "So it makes use either of the increment of time, and an equal exertion of forces through that time (which has just been denied above), or of a physical machine, which is ridiculous (for by the example of the sun and moon we suppose the celestial bodies to be round, and it is therefore also probable that the entire field of the aetheral air moves around with the planets),3 or finally, of some suitable means of indication that are variable with the altered distance of the planet from the sun.", "3393": "And other than the sun's apparent diameter alone, nothing else presents itself.", "3394": "Thus we humans know that the sun is 229 of its own semidiameters distant from us when its diameter subtends 30', and 222 semidiameters when it subtends 31' ^4.", "3395": "If it were indeed certain that this proper motion of the planet along the diameter of the epicycle could not be carried out by any material and corporeal or magnetic power of the planet, nor by an unassisted animate power, but that  it is governed by a planetary mind, nothing absurd would be stated ^5.", "3396": "For that the sun is observed by the planets in other respects as well, the latitudes bear witness.", "3397": "For by these latitudes the planets would depart from the middle and royal road of this solar power, as from the mainstream of a river, and move to the sides, as is said in Chapter 38, unless they meanwhile paid attention to the sun, and carried out their approach and recession along a line drawn to its center.", "3398": "They would then describe circles which, seen from the earth or the center of the world, would appear smaller, parallel to some great circle.", "3399": "But all planets describe great circles that intersect the ecliptic at points that are opposite with respect to the sun, as was demonstrated for Mars from observations  above in Chapters 12, 13, and 14.", "3400": "Therefore, the diameter of reciprocation \u03b3\u03b6 is also directed towards the sun, and the latitudes heed the sun in every respect.", "3401": "However, in Part 5 below I will also transfer this characteristic of the latitude from the elements of mind to the elements of nature and magnetic faculties.", "3402": "Now one cannot say in reply to me that the solar diameter and its variation is far too small to be used as a standard.", "3403": "For it is certain that there is no planet for which it entirely vanishes.", "3404": "Since on earth it is thirty minutes, on Mars it will be twenty, on Jupiter seven, and on Saturn three, while on Venus it will be forty, and on Mercury at least eighty and sometimes as high as one hundred and twenty.", "3405": "Do not grumble about the smallness of the body, but rather the unapt coarseness of human senses, which cannot follow such small things.", "3406": "One should on the contrary note that this body, however nonetheless capable of moving such distant bodies in a circle, as is demonstrated in the preceding chapters.", "3407": "The illumination of the world by such a tiny corpuscle is known to all.", "3408": "And so it is credible that if the movers are endowed with some faculty of observing its diameter, this faculty is as much more acute than our eyes as its work, and the perpetual motion, is more constant than our own troubled and confused schemes.", "3409": "So then, Kepler, would you give each of the planets a pair of eyes?", "3410": "By no  means, nor is this necessary, no more than that they need feet or wings in order  to move.", "3411": "But Brahe has recently eliminated solid orbs.", "3412": "Now our theorizing has not emptied nature's treasure house: we still cannot establish, through our own knowledge, how many senses there ought to be.", "3413": "There are even examples at hand worthy of our admiration.", "3414": "For tell us, in physical terms: with what eyes shall the animate faculties of sublunar bodies look upon the positions of the stars in the zodiac, so that when a harmonic arrangement (which we call \"aspects\") is found among them, the bodies leap up and become inflamed for their task?", "3415": "Was it with her eyes that my noted the positions of the stars in order to know that she was born with Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, all in sextiles and trines?", "3416": "And could it have been by the same means that she gave birth to her children, and especially to me her first born, chiefly on those days when as many as possible of the same aspects, especially of Saturn and Jupiter, recurred, or when as many pristine positions as possible were occupied by squares, oppositions, and conjunctions?", "3417": "I have observed those things in all cases whatever that have occurred to this very day.", "3418": "But why do I say these things that are just as absurd as the previous ones, but for those who have exercised themselves in natural matters more diligently than is usual nowadays?", "3419": "So our hypothetical person who says that the planet's path is a perfect circle will say this: that the planet performs its reciprocation so as to make the diameters of the sun, at the end points of equal arcs of the eccentric, appear very nearly*  inversely proportional to the lines \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, or to \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, which are equal to them, taken with respect to the longest line \u03b3\u03b1; and that through this consideration of the diameters of the sun at the chosen moments of time, come the proximities of \u03b9, \u03bb, \u03b6 to \u03b3.", "3420": "It should be known, however, that the increases of the diameter of the sun and the arcs of the epicycle do not square with each other well, and so the motive mind will have to have a very good memory in order to adjust the unequal versed sines of the arcs on the epicycle to the equal increases of the solar diameter.", "3421": "For this, see Ch.", "3422": "56 and 57 below.", "3423": "Let that be enough concerning the means of indicating distances.", "3424": "There  remains a third point about the animate faculty that carries the planet around that I briefly draw attention to: anyone who says that the body of a planet is moved by an inherent force is just plain wrong.", "3425": "This we rejected at the beginning.", "3426": "But it is also impossible simply to ascribe this force to the sun instead.", "3427": "For the same force that attracts the planet also repels it in turn, and this is inconsistent with the simplicity of the solar body.", "3428": "But anyone who by some unique argument reduces this motion to the bodies of the sun and the planet in concerted action gives a new cast to the material of this entire chapter, and under this rubric Chapter 57 below is specifically assigned for this topic.", "3429": "You see, my thoughtful and intelligent reader, that the opinion of a perfect eccentric circle for the path of a planet drags many incredible things into physical theories.", "3430": "This is not, indeed, because it makes the solar diameter an indicator for the planetary mind, for this opinion will perhaps turn out to be closest to the truth, but because it ascribes incredible faculties to the mover, both mental and animate.", "3431": "But we, who are close to the truth, should find out how to cast these theories (which, though not everywhere perfect, are nonetheless suitable for the sun's motions) in numerical form.", "3432": "In the end, it will be helpful for a more exact discovery of the truth, reserved for Chapter 57, that we had previously worked on them here.", "3433": "Chapter 40", "3434": "An imperfect method for computing the equations from the physical hypothesis, which nonetheless suffices for the theory of the sun or earth.", "3435": "Such a long-winded discussion was necessary to prepare a way for a natural form for the equations, on which I am going to be very busy in Part 4.", "3436": "Now we must return to the equations of the sun's eccentric in particular, which is the main subject of this third part, and for the sake of which the general discussion of the last eight chapters has been presented.", "3437": "My first error was to suppose that the path of the planet is a perfect circle, a supposition that was all the more noxious a thief of time the more it was endowed with the authority of all philosophers, and the more convenient it was for metaphysics in particular.", "3438": "Accordingly, let the path of the planet be a perfect eccentric, for in the theory of the sun the amount by which it differs from the oval path is imperceptible.", "3439": "Those things that are going to be needed for the other planets, on account of this deviation, follow below in ch.", "3440": "59 and 60.", "3441": "Since, therefore, the time increments of a planet over equal parts of the eccentric are to one another as the distances of those parts, and since the individual points of the entire semicircle of the eccentric are all at different distances, it was no easy task I set myself when I sought to find how the sums of the individual distances may be obtained.", "3442": "For unless we can find the sum of all of them (and they are infinite in number) we cannot say how great the time increment is for any one of them.", "3443": "Thus the equation will not be known.", "3444": "For the whole sum of the distances is to the whole periodic time as any partial sum of the distances is to its corresponding time.", "3445": "I consequently began by dividing the eccentric into 360 parts, as if these were least particles, and supposed that within one such part the distance does not change.", "3446": "I then found the distances at the beginnings of the parts or degrees by the method of chapter 29, and added them all up.", "3447": "Next, I assigned an artificial round number to the periodic time; although it is in fact 365 days and 6 hours, I set it equal to 360 degrees, or a full circle, which for the astronomers is the mean anomaly.", "3448": "As a result, I have so arranged it that as the sum of  the distances is to the sum of the time, so is any given distance to its time.", "3449": "Finally, I added the times over the individual degrees and compared these times, or degrees of mean anomaly,  with the degrees of the eccentric anomaly, or the number of parts whose distance was sought.", "3450": "This furnished the physical equation, to which the optical equation, found by the method of Chapter 29 with those same distances, was to be added in order to have the whole.", "3451": "However, since this procedure is mechanical and tedious, and since it is impossible to compute the equation given the ratio for one individual degree without the others, I looked around for other means.", "3452": "And since I knew that the points of the eccentric are infinite, and their distances are infinite, it struck me that all these distances are contained in the plane of the eccentric.", "3453": "For I had remembered that Archimedes, in seeking the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, once thus divided a circle into an infinity of triangles - this being the hidden force of his reductio ad absurdum.", "3454": "Accordingly, instead of dividing the circumference, as before, I now cut the plane of the eccentric into 360 parts by lines drawn from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned.", "3455": "Let AB be the line of apsides, A the sun (or earth, for Ptolemy); B the center of the eccentric CD, whose semicircle CD shall be divided into any number of equal parts CG, GH, HE, EI, IK, KD, and let the points A and B be connected with the points of division.", "3456": "Therefore, AC will be the greatest distance, AD the least, and the others, in order, are AG, AH, AE, AI, AK.", "3457": "And since triangles under equal altitudes are as their bases, and the sectors, or triangles, CBG, GBH, and so on (standing upon least parts of the circumference and therefore not differing from straight lines) all have the same altitude, the equal sides BC, BG, BH, they are therefore all equal.", "3458": "But all the triangles are contained in the area CDE, and all the arcs or bases are contained in the circumference CED.", "3459": "Therefore, by composition, as the area CDE is to the arc CED so is the area CBG to the arc CG, and alternately, as arc CED is to CG, CH, and the rest in order, so is the area CDE to the areas CBG, CBH, and the rest in order.", "3460": "Therefore, no error is introduced if the areas be taken for the arcs in this way, and substituting the areas CGB, CHB for the angles of eccentric anomaly CBG, CBH.", "3461": "Further, just as the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the circumference are all contained in the area of the semicircle CDE, and the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the arc CH are all contained in the area CBH, therefore also the straight lines from A to the same infinite parts of the circumference or arc make up the same thing.", "3462": "And finally, since those drawn from A and B both fill up one and the same semicircle CDE, while those from A", "3463": "are the very distances whose sum is sought, it therefore seemed to me I could conclude that by computing the area CAH or CAE I would have the sum of the infinite distances in CH or CE, not because the infinite can be traversed, but because I thought that the measure of the faculty by which the collected distances mete out the times is contained in this area, so that we would be able to obtain it by knowing the area without an enumeration of least parts.", "3464": "Therefore, from the above, as the area CDE is to half the periodic time, which we have proclaimed to be 180\u00b0, so are the areas CAG, CAH to the times on CG and CH.", "3465": "Thus the area CGA becomes a measure of the time or mean anomaly corresponding to the arc of the eccentric CG, since the mean anomaly measures the time ^1.", "3466": "Earlier, however, the part CGB of this area CAG was the measure of the eccentric anomaly, whose optical equation is the angle BGA.", "3467": "Therefore, the remaining area, that of the triangle BGA, is the excess (for this place) of the mean anomaly over the eccentric anomaly, and the angle BGA of that triangle is the excess of the eccentric anomaly CBG over the equated anomaly CAG.", "3468": "Thus the knowledge of this one triangle provides both parts of the equation corresponding to the equated anomaly GAC.", "3469": "And hence it is manifest why in Chapters 30 and 31 above I said that in  the theory of the sun the parts of the equation are very nearly equal.", "3470": "That is, any given arc, and the angle at the center which it subtends (as CG and CBG in the figure), are measured by its area, which is called the \"sector\", as area CBG.", "3471": "Therefore, with one arm of the compass at G, with radius GB, let an arc of the circumference be described intersecting GA at O. Hence, as the area GBC is to the angle GBC, so is the area BGO to the angle BGO.", "3472": "But the angle BGO is the optical part of the equation.", "3473": "Thus the area GOB, through the doubling of the part of the equation, measures the optical part of the equation, for in our account presented earlier the whole area GBA was to be consulted for the physical part of the equation.", "3474": "Now clearly the genuine measure of the physical part of the equation AGB exceeds the proposed measure of the optical part OGB by the small space or area OAB (while near the perigee the latter in turn exceeds the former by a small area).", "3475": "Nevertheless, if the eccentricity is small, as is that of the sun or earth, with which we are concerned in this third part, this is not perceptible.", "3476": "For the nearer it approaches to the line of apsides, the narrower becomes the whole triangle AGB and consequently also its little part AOB, however much its altitude AO increases at the same time.", "3477": "On the other hand, in the middle elongations, the angle BEA with its sector is at a certain point directly measured by the area BEA, and the excess begins to turn into a defect.", "3478": "Therefore, the greatest difference that can occur is that accumulated at the octants, or locations intermediate between the apsides and the quadrants.", "3479": "How great that difference is, will now be shown.", "3480": "Since for some time now I have used the same form of computation by means of areas in the theory of Mars, I could not ignore this difference on account of the planet's great eccentricity, nor did the doubling of the optical equation avoid all perceptible error.", "3481": "It was therefore necessary to investigate the area of the triangle of the equation [triangulum aequatorium].", "3482": "This can be done in various ways, but I shall go on to state the easiest.", "3483": "It is well known that triangles with equal altitudes are proportional to\ntheir bases.", "3484": "I say also, that triangles on equal bases are proportional to\ntheir altitudes.", "3485": "Let AGB, AHB stand upon the same base AB extended to C. From G let the line GN be drawn parallel to the common base AB and intersecting HB at N, and let N be connected with A. From the three vertices G, \u0397, N, of the triangles let GM, HL, MP be drawn perpendicular to the base, determining the altitudes of the triangles.", "3486": "Therefore, since GN and MP are parallel, and GM, NP are perpendicular [to them], GM and NP will be equal.", "3487": "But GM is the altitude of triangle AGB, and NP is the altitude of triangle ANB.", "3488": "Therefore triangles ANB and AGB have equal altitudes, and since they are both on the same base AB, they are equal.", "3489": "And since ANB is part of AHB, and the base line HB is common, together with the vertex A, the triangles NAB and HAB have equal altitudes.", "3490": "Therefore, as the base NB is to BH, so is NAB to HAB.", "3491": "But NAB and GAB were proved equal.", "3492": "Therefore, as NB is to BH, so is GAB to HAB.", "3493": "But as BN is to BH, so is NP to HL, because NBP and HBL are similar triangles.", "3494": "Therefore also, as NP is to HL, so is GAB to HAB.", "3495": "But NP and GM are equal.", "3496": "Therefore, as GM is to HL, altitude to altitude, so is area GAB to area HAB.", "3497": "q.e.d.", "3498": "Now let BE be perpendicular to CD, and let the triangle BEA have a right angle at B. BE will be the altitude, and BA the base.", "3499": "Therefore, by Euclid I.42, 900, or half the base BA (which for the sun is 1800), multiplied by the altitude BE, 100,000, which is the radius of the circle, gives the area of the triangle BEA, that is, 90,000,000.", "3500": "But  the area of a circle of radius 100,000 (from the most recent investigations of Adrian Romanus, a most expert geometer)2 is 31,415,926,536, with no error in even the last digit.", "3501": "And as this the area of the circle is to the 360\u00b0 of mean anomaly or time (that is, 21,600' or 1,296,000\"), so is the area of the triangle, 90,000,000, to 3713\"; that is, 1\u00b0 1' 53\".", "3502": "So the area BEA has a value of 1\u00b0 1' 53\".", "3503": "But in Chapters 29 and 30, the angle BEA was also 1\u00b0 1' 53\".", "3504": "Therefore, both parts of the equation are equal at this place, that is, near 90\u00b0.", "3505": "At other degrees of eccentric anomaly, we proceed as follows.", "3506": "Since BEA is 3713\", as its altitude EB is to HL or GM, the altitudes of the other triangles \u2014that is, as the whole sine is to the sines of the eccentric anomaly HBC, GBC\u2014so is 3713\" to the areas of the remaining triangles.", "3507": "So 3713\" will be multiplied by the sines of the angles at B, and, with the last five digits struck, the remainder will be the physical part of the equation expressed in seconds, corresponding to the angle at B. For example, let HBC be 45\u00b0 43' 46\", as it was above in Ch.", "3508": "31.", "3509": "Therefore, its sine, 71605, multiplied by 3713\", with the last five digits struck, gives 2659\", that is, 44' 19\".", "3510": "In the table above, we assumed this to be equal to the optical part of the equation, 43' 46\".", "3511": "Therefore, this little area ABO at its greatest does not exceed 33\".", "3512": "And this is that fourth procedure for computing the eccentric equations, of which I began to speak above near the end of Chapter 34, which closely expresses the very nature of things and the foregoing theories of Chapters 32 and 33.", "3513": "Nevertheless, my argument contains a paralogism, not, indeed, of great  moment.", "3514": "It arises from this: that while Archimedes did indeed divide the circle into an infinity of triangles, they stood upon the circumference at right angles, so that their vertices were at the center of the circle B.

from the given sides of the given angles, the angles of equated anomaly corresponding to these mean anomalies come out to be 41\u00b0 28' 54\" and 130\u00b0 59' 25\".", "3793": "But by the vicarious hypothesis, as in Chapter 18 of this work, the same simple anomalies of 48\u00b0 45' 12\" and 138\u00b0", "3794": "45' 12\" being taken, the equated anomaly for the former comes out to be 41\u00b0 20' 33\", less than by the area of the triangle, the excess being 8' 21\"; and for the latter, 131\u00b0 7' 26\", more than by the area of the triangle, the defect being 8'.", "3795": "So, since it is certain that an error of this magnitude cannot be attributed to our vicarious hypothesis, I had to accept that this procedure for finding the  equations was still imperfect.", "3796": "Indeed, in Chapter 19 as well, when I tried out the bisection on Mars and computed the equations using a motionless point of the equant in the Ptolemaic manner, a difference was found at about 45\u00b0 of eccentric anomaly of nearly the same amount, but in the opposite direction.", "3797": "For in the upper quadrant, the planet was closer to the aphelion, and in the lower to the perihelion, than it should have been; while here in the upper quadrant it was farther from the aphelion, and in the lower from the perihelion, than it should be.", "3798": "And so in the upper quadrant it is moving too swiftly away from the aphelion, and the same from the perihelion below.", "3799": "Therefore, it is slower than it should be in the middle elongations.", "3800": "I believe it has just occurred to the reader that the cause of these errors might  perhaps lie in the flaw to which this operation with areas is subject, mentioned in Chapter 40: that the areas are not equivalent to the distances that modify the swiftness and slowness.", "3801": "But the present error cannot arise thence.", "3802": "For first of all, the excess of the sum of the distances over the area of the circle is small: just about as small, that is, as the little space between the conchoids.", "3803": "Then, too, the area makes all the distances a little smaller than they should be, and most of all those that are at the middle elongations.", "3804": "So if any error flows from this, it lies in our not having made the planet take enough time in the middle elongations.", "3805": "But the errors we are now seeing are in the opposite direction, for we have made the planet take too much time in the middle elongations.", "3806": "The same can be raised in objection to anyone who might conceive a suspicion that the error arose because we rejected the double epicycle of Copernicus and Tycho, which makes the orbit of the planet oval, and took up the Ptolemaic perfect circle in the present account.", "3807": "For it was said at the end of Chapter 4 that the Copernican orbit moves outwards from the center by 246 parts, which would only increase the error, rather than making an incursion towards the center, as would suit our purposes, since we are now following the idea that the time increments are proportional to the distances.", "3808": "But to make it clear to the eye that the area of  the conchoid of Ch.", "3809": "40 is made very small, consider that the secant of the angle 5\u00b0 19' (the maximum optical equation) is 100,432, which is the line EA.", "3810": "So from this excess of 432, which is the small line BA, part of the line EA, we will be able to get an approximate idea of the sum of all these excesses (such as, QA, RA, BA, SA, LA) in this way.", "3811": "The secant of 89\u00b0, and its tangent, taken together, are as great as the sines  of all degrees of the whole semicircle, as Cardano helps us see in the part of De subtilitate in which he explains the properties of the circle ^1.", "3812": "A proof of this is given by Justus Byrgius ^2.", "3813": "Therefore, if all our remaining excesses (other than the greatest, 432) were [to the greatest]3 as [all] the sines in one semicircle are to the semidiameter, then as 100,000 is to the sum of the secant and the tangent of 89\u00b0 (that is, 11,458,869), so,  approximately, would 432 be to 49,934, the approximate sum of all the excesses at integral degrees of the semicircle ^4.", "3814": "For the excesses of the distances in the upper quadrant are longer than those excesses of the secants, to about the same extent that they are shorter in the lower quadrant.", "3815": "But nevertheless, it is not true that the excesses QA, RA, SA, and so on, are to one another as the sines of the corresponding number of degrees ^5.", "3816": "Instead, they are approximately in the duplicate ratio of the sines.", "3817": "As for example, the sine of 90\u00b0 is twice the sine of 30\u00b0.", "3818": "Now the optical equation of 90\u00b0 is 5\u00b0 19', and half of its sine gives an arc which is likewise about its half, that is, 2\u00b0 39\u2019 15\", for the optical equation at 30\u00b0 of eccentric anomaly, whose secant is 100,107.", "3819": "And here 107, the excess of the secant over the radius, is about one fourth of the former, 432, while the sine of 30\u00b0 would be half the sine of 90\u00b0.", "3820": "Some geometer should see whether this argument be demonstrable.", "3821": "For me it suffices at present to answer those very small questions with which I am occupied.", "3822": "Therefore, to arrive at 432, parts are accumulated that are not proportional to the sines, but are always smaller, and at the 45th degree or thereabouts are but their halves.", "3823": "Before that point they are less than the halves, so that about 30\u00b0 they are only the fourths, and at length become imperceptible.", "3824": "And so, of the sum of 49,934, we retain only one seventh, or about 7000.", "3825": "This is also shown empirically, by computing all the distances degree by degree and adding them up ^6.", "3826": "And because one distance of 100,000 has the value of 60', this little sum has a value of no more than 4\u2155\u20197 which is nonetheless spread all around the circumference, so that about 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, where it is greatest, this tiny error turns out to be imperceptible even in Mars.", "3827": "Consequently, we must seek another occasion for this discrepancy.", "3828": "Chapter 44", "3829": "The path of the planet through the ethereal air is not a circle, not even with respect to the first inequality alone, even if you mentally remove the Brahean and Ptolemaic complex of spirals resulting from the second inequality in these two authors.", "3830": "With the eccentricity and the ratio of the orbs established with the utmost certainty, it might appear strange to an astronomer that there remains yet another impediment in the way of astronomy's triumph.", "3831": "And me, Lord knows, I had triumphed for two full years.", "3832": "Nevertheless, by a comparison of the things which have  been established in Chapters 41, 42, and 43, preceding, it is readily apparent what we are still lacking.", "3833": "The positions of the aphelia, eccentricity, and the ratio of the orbs, as constituted in the several places, differed greatly from one another.", "3834": "Nor were the computed physical equations in agreement with the observations (which the vicarious hypothesis represents).", "3835": "Let the diagram of Chapter 41 be brought back.", "3836": "And because, in that diagram, in units of which \u03b3\u03b7 was 151,740, \u03b3\u03b1 would have been 14,822, when \u03b3\u03b1 and \u03b3\u03b7 or \u03b3\u03b5 are added, \u03b1\u03b5 would be 166,562.", "3837": "In Chapter 42 this was found to be 166,780.", "3838": "Likewise, when \u03b3\u03b1 is subtracted from \u03b3\u03b4, the remainder, \u03b1\u03b4, would be 136,918, which in Chapter 42 was found to be fully 138,500.", "3839": "Again, the true length of the lines \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b1\u03b5, and \u03b1\u03b4 was found in Chapter 421 If, therefore, what was supposed and used in Chapter 41 is true, that the path of the planet is a circle, it is not difficult to say how much \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b8 ought to be.", "3840": "Since in Oct.", "3841": "1590 \u03b1\u03b5 was at 28\u00b0 41' 40\" Leo, and \u03ba, \u03b7, \u03b8 are as given in Chapter 41, the angles \u03ba\u03b1\u03b3, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b3, \u03b8\u03b1\u03b3 will be given.", "3842":

these angles is to the truest eccentricity \u03b1\u03b3, 14,140, so are the sines of \u03ba\u03b3\u03b5, \u03b7\u03b3\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b3\u03b1 to \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b8.", "3844": "3\nIf anyone wishes to attribute this difference to the slippery luck of observing, he must surely not have felt nor paid attention to the force of the demonstrations used hitherto, and will be shamelessly imputing to me the vilest fraud in corrupting the observations of Brahe.", "3845": "I therefore appeal to the observations of subsequent years, at least those that experienced observers made.", "3846": "For if in any respect I have given free rein to my inclinations in one direction, it will only go so much the farther into error on the other side.", "3847": "But there is no need of this.", "3848": "I am addressing this to you who are experienced in matters astronomical, who know that in astronomy there is no tolerance for the sophistical loopholes that beset other disciplines.", "3849": "To you I appeal.", "3850": "You see at \u03ba a small defect from the circle, at \u03b7, \u03b8 on both sides, a rather large one, enough so that we cannot excuse it by uncertainties in observing (for in Chapter 42 I reckon an uncertainty of perhaps 200, or at most 300 units).", "3851": "What, then, is to be said?", "3852": "Could this actually be the situation described in Chapter 6 above, in which by transposition of the reference point from the sun's mean motion to its apparent motion I set up another eccentric that makes an excursion towards the side of the sun's apogee?", "3853": "By no means.", "3854": "For there, it would approach from the one side by the same amount as it moves away on the other.", "3855": "Here, however, you see that the planet approaches the center from the circular orbit on both sides.", "3856": "This is confirmed by many other observations, some of which follow below in Chapters 51 and 53.", "3857": "Clearly, then, [what is to be said] is this: the orbit of the planet is not a circle, but comes in gradually on both sides and returns again to the circle's distance at perigee.", "3858": "They are accustomed to call the shape of this sort of path  \"oval.\"", "3859": "This same thing is also proved from Chapter 43 preceding.", "3860": "There it was  supposed that the area of a perfect eccentric is very closely equivalent to all the distances of the equal parts of the circumference of that eccentric from the source of the motive power, however many they are.", "3861": "Thus, the parts of the area measure the amounts of time which the planet spends on the parts of the corresponding eccentric circumference.", "3862": "But if that area about which the planet marks a boundary is not a perfect circle, but is diminished at the sides from the amplitude it has at the apsides, and if nevertheless this area circumscribed by an irregular orbit still measures the times which the planet takes to traverse the whole and its equal parts, then this diminished area measures a time equal to that measured by the previous undiminished area.", "3863": "So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there.", "3864": "So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened.", "3865": "Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4.", "3866": "And indeed, if contraries remedy one another, this is plainly the aptest medicine for purging the faults under which, in Chapter 43 above, our physical hypothesis was perceived to be laboring.", "3867": "For the planet is going to be swifter at the middle elongations, where previously it was perceived to be going slower than it should, and it will be slowed down above and below, near the apsides, where previously it did violence to the equations belonging to the eighths of the period through its excessive fleetness.", "3868": "This, then, is the other argument by which it is proved that the orbit of the planet really is deflected from the established circle, making ingress towards the sides and the centre of the eccentric.", "3869": "But for all that, this argument still did not have enough effect upon me to let me go beyond it and think about the planet's departure from the orbit.", "3870": "When I had sweated for the longest time trying to reconcile equations of this sort, I was finally discouraged by the absurdity of the measurements, and abandoned the whole enquiry until I was informed by the distances (found in the way shown in Chapter 41) about the departure from the [circular] orbit, and once more took up this problem of the equations.", "3871": "And from this, what I promised I would prove, in Chapters 20 and 23 above, is now done: that the orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape.", "3872": "Chapter 45", "3873": "On the natural causes of this deflection of the planet from the circle: first opinion examined.", "3874": "When I was first informed in this manner by Brahe's most certain  observations that the orbit of the planet is not exactly circular but is deficient at the sides, I judged that I also knew the natural cause of the deflection from its footprints.", "3875": "For I had worked very hard on that subject in Chapter 39.", "3876": "And I suggest to the reader that he reread that entire chapter carefully before going on.", "3877": "For in that chapter I assigned the cause of the eccentricity to a certain power that is in the body of the planet.", "3878": "It therefore followed that the cause of this deflecting from the eccentric circle should also be ascribed to the same body of the planet.", "3879": "But then what they say in the proverb, \"A hasty dog bears blind pups,\" happened to me.", "3880": "For in Chapter 39,1 worked very energetically on the question of why I could not state a probable enough cause for a perfect circle's resulting from the orbit of the planet, as some absurdities always had to be attributed to the power that has its seat in the planet's body.", "3881": "Now, having seen from the observations that the planet's orbit is not perfectly circular, I immediately succumbed to this great persuasive impetus, believing that from those things which were called absurd in fabricating the circle in Chapter 39, now transmuted into a more probable form, an orbit of the planet that would be both correct and in agreement with the observations would be effected.", "3882": "If I had embarked upon this path a little more thoughtfully, I might have immediately arrived at the truth of the matter.", "3883": "But since I was blind from desire, and did not pay attention to each and every part of Chapter 39, staying instead with the first thought to offer itself\u2014a wonderfully probable one, owing to the uniformity of the epicyclic motion\u2014I entered into new labyrinths, from which we will have to extract ourselves in this Chapter 45 and the following ones all the way to 50.", "3884": "Let the diagram from Chapter 39 be repeated.", "3885": "The weaker opinion in that chapter was that, in order to describe a perfect circle, the planet effects an epicycle by its inherent force, thus disengaging its body from the ray of power from the sun.", "3886": "As, for example, if the ray of power from the sun be AC, and move forward at an unequal pace from AC to A\u03b3, while the planet be initially at C, and from that time forth, by its inherent force, it disengage itself from [the ray] AC or A\u03b3.", "3887": "Thus, at the time when AC comes to A\u03b3, the planet from C or \u03b3 would come to D, and would also do this at a nonuniform pace, more swiftly or slowly in the same proportion as [the length of] AC.", "3888": "For in this fashion the line ND through the center  of the epicycle and the planet remains ever parallel to the line AB.", "3889": "However, I said in Chapter 39 that it appeared absurd to me that the planet [in moving] from \u03b3 to D at a nonuniform pace disengages itself from the ray of the solar power, and thus accommodates itself by its own force to the extrinsic force from the sun, and has foreknowledge of its speed and the decrease thereof.", "3890": "Therefore, to avoid this absurdity, let AC still go nonuniformly, but let the planet go uniformly from \u03b3 to D. Let us see whether what follows is anything like what we have proved in the preceding chapter from the observations.", "3891": "While the center of the epicycle N and its aphelion [in moving] from the line AC to A\u03b3 will be slow from C to \u03b3, it being near the eccentric's aphelion C, let the planet [in moving] from \u03b3 to D be supposed not to be slow but to proceed with its mean motion.", "3892": "Consequently, the angle \u03b3ND will be greater than the angle \u03b3AC.", "3893": "So ND will not be parallel to AB but will be inclined towards AC.", "3894": "Thus the planet D will not stay on the circle which it began to describe from C, the one, that is, which goes through CF, but will encroach from the circumference D and the parallel ND towards CA.", "3895": "And this same thing was also affirmed in the previous chapter by the distances AD computed from the observations, namely, that they do not reach all the way to the circumference of the circle CF.", "3896": "This same thing was also affirmed by the physical equations constructed through the summation of the distances AC, AD, namely, that the planet ought to be faster at the sides of the eccentric; that is, that its distances from the sun ought to be supposed smaller.", "3897": "Therefore, since this consensus brought to bear a considerable force of persuasion, I concluded forthwith that the planet's incursion at the sides is the result of this: that the power moving the planet and administering the distances according to the law of the circle supersedes the power of the sun, in that the former made equal progress in equal times thus sending the planet down uniformly towards the sun according to the law of the epicycle, while the latter, in its varying degrees [of speed obtained] through the varying distances, moved the planet in its care forward nonuniformly, and more slowly when it is high.", "3898": "It thus happened that the distances of equal arcs on the epicycle were accumulated near the aphelion C and the perihelion F, and were more sparsely scattered about the middle elongations.", "3899": "In this way, all the shorter ones were drawn back upwards from the correct [circular] distances from perihelion to the place of longer ones.", "3900": "That error therefore began to become rooted in me which I had happily begun to refute in Chapter 39 above, that it is a property of the planetary power to lead the body of the planet around in the path of an epicycle.", "3901": "Had the diameter of the epicycle ND remained equidistant from AB, I could have shed my erroneous opinion, and could have ascribed (as is perfectly correct) all promotion in zodiacal longitude to the sun, leaving to the planet only the reciprocation on the diameter \u03b3\u03b6, as in part of Chapter 39.", "3902": "But because the observations testified that the diameter of the epicycle is inclined in the middle elongations, this error concerning the motion of the planet on the circumference of the epicycle, whose motion would be regular measured with respect to the line \u0391\u039d\u03b3 going from the sun A through the center of  the epicycle N, was admirably confirmed in me.", "3903": "Think yourself, reader, and you will feel the force of the argument.", "3904": "For I did not think it possible for the planet's orbit to be rendered oval in any other way.", "3905": "When, therefore, these things occurred to me, quite certain of the quantity of the incursion at the sides (that is, that the numbers would be in agreement), I celebrated another triumph over Mars.", "3906": "Nor did it appear to me any difficulty, if there were some discord among the numbers, to dissipate it through some slight adjustment in the equations of the center1 all around, so as to make it imperceptible.", "3907": "And we, good reader, can fairly indulge in so splendid a triumph for a brief day's respite (for the following five chapters, that is), meanwhile repressing the rumors of renewed rebellion, lest its splendor die before we enjoy it.", "3908": "If anything will be left of it afterwards, we shall go through it in the proper time and order.", "3909": "We are merry indeed now, but [will be] active and energetic then.", "3910": "Chapter 46", "3911": "How the line of the planet\u2019s motion can be described from the opinion of Chapter 45, and what its properties are.", "3912": "In the preceding chapter a cause was stated by which it could happen that the planet depart from a circular orbit.", "3913": "However, the geometrical description of the path cannot be carried out using this model.", "3914": "For the epicycle is inclined according to the length of the distances, while the multitude and length of the distances is in turn dependent upon the rotation of the epicycle.", "3915": "And because the sum of the distances is contained in the plane of the eccentric, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, that sum cannot be found unless the epicycle be transformed into an eccentric.", "3916": "But it was demonstrated in Chapter 2, and repeated in Chapter 39, and used in Chapter 40, that if a concentric be described about center \u03b1 with semidiameter equal to \u03b2\u03b4, and on it an epicycle with semidiameter \u03b1\u03b2; and then about center \u03b2 an eccentric \u03b4\u03bb with eccentricity \u03b1\u03b2; and afterwards the circumferences of both the epicycle and the eccentric \u03b4\u03bb be divided into similar parts; the distances of the points of division, both of the epicycle and the eccentric, from the chosen point \u03b1 are respectively equal to one another in length.", "3917": "On this premise, since in Chapter 40 we posited an eccentric to present a plain and easy demonstration, and a method of computing the distances, here, too, we can examine the distances on the eccentric, even though we are supposing them to be meted out by the uniform motion of the planet\u2019s epicycle.", "3918": "This procedure seems to open a way to us to a geometrical description of the planetary path that follows from the hypothesis of Chapter 45.", "3919": "Let us therefore say, for the sake  of understanding, that in the circuit of the epicycle the planet makes digressions from the sun \u03b1 of the same magnitude as if it were on the circumference of a perfect eccentric \u03b4\u03bb (and let this be a semicircle defined by the straight line \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4) describing equal arcs in equal times, such as \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b5\u03b6, \u03b6\u03b8, \u03b8\u03b9, \u03b9\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bb.", "3920": "It does this in such a manner that the angles at \u03b2 are equal, and \u03b2 is the point of uniform motion, at least for this position for which the distances are being sought.", "3921": "Let the points of division be connected to \u03b1 and \u03b2.

For this method of computing or demonstrating the distance, from Ch.", "4210": "45, has  so far had the status of an assumption.", "4211": "But let DG be a small part of the circle, such as 1\u00b0 out of the 360\u00b0.", "4212": "And since all the distances AG of this sort at the ends D and G of all the degrees DG can be computed in this way, by what was demonstrated in Chapter 29, I gathered all the 360 distances AG into one sum, in a very long addition.", "4213": "This was found to be 36,075,5621 (with an eccentricity of 9165), corresponding to the entire oval path of Mars.", "4214": "Now about center A, with radius AG, let an arc, GC, be described towards D. And because the greater the distance the shorter the planet's path, when the distance of an arc of the circle DG is given (which arc is now, when we are computing the distance GA, nothing but the measure of the time), the length of the oval path DC will also be given, which the planet describes in the time DG under consideration (which is a simple anomaly of 1\u00b0).", "4215": "For as the length of the whole of the oval circumference is to the sum of all the distances, so is the distance of the arc DC (found by the arc DG) to the length of its oval arc DC.", "4216": "For it was proved in Ch.", "4217": "33 above, and used in Chapter 46 (where the foundations for this operation were laid) that the arcs traversed are inversely as the distances.", "4218": "However, I applied this precaution: that AD and AG, the distances of the ends C and D of the arc from A, be added, and the mean of the sum be taken as the genuine distance of the whole arc DC.", "4219": "For let", "4220": "some eccentric circle DK described about center B, be divided into any number of parts, say, at D, G, L, K, \u039c, N, and from the beginnings of the parts let arcs be drawn about the center of the world A until they intersect the lines drawn from A to the ends of the arcs, as DO, GP, LQ, KR,", "4221": "MS, NT.", "4222": "The areas on the left semicircle, ADO,", "4223": "AGP, ALQ, will be greater than they should be, while the arcs on the right, ANT, AMS, AKR, will be less than they should be.", "4224": "So, when least arcs are in question, the one is compensated by the other, so that TNA and ODA are very nearly equal to the area GDNA.", "4225": "Next, the length DC in the previous diagram being thus given, to correspond to the given time DG and to the distance GA or CA, the angle of equated anomaly CAD now also should be found.", "4226": "Let C be joined to B, and let AC be extended to E, where it intersects the circle, and BC to the intersection F.

BH, so is the greater circle DG to the smaller circles DK and KH.", "4256": "But DI is the arithmetic mean between DB and HB, because BI is half of HD.", "4257": "Therefore, the circle DK too, touching the smaller and larger circles described about the same center B, is the arithmetic mean between those circles that it touches.", "4258": "If the oval path is continued, by hypothesis it will be tangent to the greater circle at aphelion D and perihelion R, and to the smaller circle HK at the middle elongations.", "4259": "Thus, it is greater than the smaller circle HK, and smaller than the greater circle DR.", "4260": "It is therefore likely that the oval circumference is not much different from the length of the circular circumference DK.", "4261": "The following demonstration, however, makes one believe it to be a little larger.", "4262": "Let the mean proportional between BH and BD be taken, and let it be BO, and about center B with radius BO let the circle OP be described.", "4263": "Thus, by Archimedes, On Spheroids 5, the area of this circle OP will be equal to the area of an ellipse whose longer semidiameter is BD, and whose shorter is BH.", "4264": "And because the greatest of all figures of equal perimeter is the circle, conversely (in the common significance of the term), of figures with equal area, the one with the shortest perimeter will be the circle.", "4265": "Therefore, since the proposed figures, namely, the ellipse which has semidiameters DB, BH, and the circle OP, are equal in area, from the evidence just presented, the circumference of the ellipse will be longer than the circumference of the circle OP.", "4266": "But BO is imperceptibly less than ID, since BO is taken as the geometrical mean, and ID the arithmetic mean, between the same terms.", "4267": "For by the theory presented in Euclid's Book V,2 since BO is the mean proportional between HB, BD, as the lesser, HB, is to the greater, BD, so is HO, the excess of the mean, to the defect, OD.", "4268": "3 Therefore, since HB is less than BD, HO will also be less than OD.", "4269": "But BI is equal to the half of HD.", "4270": "Therefore, BI is greater than HO, and less than OD.", "4271": "Therefore, to the common semidiameter HB of the least circle HK unequals are added, namely, less than the half of DH to make BO, and half of DH to make DI.", "4272": "Therefore, DI is greater than BO.", "4273": "Thus the circle DK is greater than OP.", "4274": "But it is only imperceptibly greater, since DH is less than a hundredth of DB.", "4275": "Therefore, on the supposition that these circles are superabundantly equal, and on the supposition that the oval is a perfect ellipse, the circumference of the oval will be a little longer than the circle DK, and certainly longer than the circle OP.", "4276": "And because in Ch.", "4277": "47 above DH was 858 where DB was 100,000, let half of DH, 429, be subtracted from DB, 100,000.", "4278": "The remainder will be 99,571.", "4279": "Next, as 100,000 is to 99,571, so almost exactly will the circumference of the circle be to the circumference of the oval, which is sought.", "4280": "And because the circumference of the circle has 360 degrees or 21,600', or 1,296,000\", a small part will be removed which has 5560\" or 92' 40\".", "4281": "And for the semi-circumference of the oval, 46' 20\" are to be subtracted, or even less, if the oval exceeds the circle DK at the place considered in the measuring.", "4282": "As for me, I made no use of any demonstration, but by a most laborious and dogged calculation found the defect of the oval semicircle to be 45' 45\", so that where the perfect semicircle is 180\u00b0, the oval would be 179\u00b0 14' 15\".", "4283": "Now this shortening of the oval circumference is necessarily equal to the opposite optical lengthening (for although this oval is shorter, it nonetheless appears contained within two right angles, or exactly 180 degrees, and is judged to be that long).", "4284": "Hence the reader may with good reason doubt  whether in this process it is necessary first to shorten the entire oval, and afterwards to lengthen it again by parts optically.", "4285": "For from the diagram it seems apparent that the shortening is at its greatest where the approach towards the center B is greatest, and vice versa.", "4286": "If in fact these variations did happen to be equal, the following method for computing the equations would arise.", "4287": "The first mean anomaly would be GBD, from which the distance GA would be computed, which, added to AD, the distance of the other end of the preceding from GD (which is always 1\u00b0), and the sum being halved, would give the uniform distance of the arc CD (the same for all its points).", "4288": "And we would then say that as the length of the semicircle is to the sum of all the distances on the semicircle, so is this distance of the arc GD to the length of FD, which is the apparent size of CD seen from B. Now from FD, as if it were a measure of the angle CBD, and from AC, AB, we would find the equated anomaly CAD by a shorter path than before.", "4289": "But the reader should know that these two variations do not keep in step.", "4290": "For the optical amplification which arises from the approach of the path DC to the center B, happens chiefly about the middle elongations, and hardly at all at aphelion and perihelion.", "4291": "Contrariwise, the shortening of the oval path, which arises from the incursion of the planet towards the center, is about the same everywhere.", "4292": "For two opposite distances at the middle elongations of the eccentric add up to the sum of two near the line of apsides, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.", "4293": "But the arcs of the oval circumference are in the inverse ratio of the distances.", "4294": "Therefore, two of these arcs, at the middle elongations, will be equal to two other arcs, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.", "4295": "If these arcs of the oval path are equal, the diminution of the arcs at all four places will be approximately equal also.", "4296": "This is confirmed by experiment.", "4297": "For if the defect of the oval semicircle is 45' 15\", the defect of the 180th part of the oval would be about 14\" about aphelion.", "4298": "And the amplification from the approach of the oval does not equal one second at aphelion.", "4299": "So, as concerns the proposed ocular estimation of the diagram, it is not quite as simple as was said in the objection, that the shortening of the oval and its optical amplification compensate one another.", "4300": "This would indeed be so if all the arcs of the oval path were presented directly when seen from center B. But this happens only at the middle elongations.", "4301": "Near the apsides, on the other hand, these arcs are not at the same distance at both ends.", "4302": "Therefore, they are not made to be as much greater in their appearance, by approaching, as they are made smaller by being shortened.", "4303": "So, following this method, I constructed equations for Mars at all degrees of the eccentric, and I did it three times.", "4304": "For the first time I took an eccentricity of 9165 that was not great enough, thinking that I had thus made this very certain through my treatment of the areas.", "4305": "And then I used more than 180\u00b0 in the figuring, when I should have used less.", "4306": "So, when this last operation showed more than 180\u00b0, which was absurd, for  the second trial I assumed half the oval to be 179\u00b0 14' 15\".", "4307": "At a mean anomaly of 45\u00b0, the result was:", "4308": "And from this, chiefly from the anomaly of 90\u00b0, I realized that the eccentricity of 9165 was too small.", "4309": "This I corrected, using the method presented in passing in the preceding chapter.", "4310": "For seeing that at the middle elongations we have 3' 50\" too much in the greatest equations, half of it, 1' 55\", is given to the optical part, and the rest to the physical.", "4311": "And since 9165 subtends 5\u00b0 15' 30\", you take 5\u00b0 17' 25\", which yields 9227.", "4312": "And so, with a new eccentricity of 9230 (which is hardly different from the 9264 which I found in Ch.", "4313": "42, nor is it much farther from 9282, which is half of the eccentricity of the equant in Ch.", "4314": "16) I went through the whole job again.", "4315": "First, the distances GA or CA were constructed at the individual whole numbers of degrees of equated distance anomaly GAD.", "4316": "Next, these were brought over to GD or GBD, the whole number of degrees of mean distance anomaly.", "4317": "Third, adjacent pairs, such as GA, AD, were added.", "4318": "Fourth, division by those divisors was carried out one hundred eighty times.", "4319": "The sum is 358\u00b0 28' 30\", which is the length of the oval path.", "4320": "Fifth, the individual arcs of the oval path were added to one another in order.", "4321": "Sixth, the optical amplifications were borrowed from the previous unsuccessful operation, since I saw that over two computations they differed hardly at all.", "4322": "So these, too were added to the above sum, in order.", "4323": "Seventh, the sums of the arcs were increased by the sums of the optical amplifications.", "4324": "Eighth, from the angle CBD thus found about the center of the eccentric B, and the distance CA as opposite side, and the eccentricity AB as the third side, I sought out the 180 angles of optical equation ACB, whence the total equations and the equated anomalies were derived.", "4325": "The resulting anomalies were:", "4326": "So the eccentricity still can be increased, and up above, [moving] from aphelion, the planet is made to be slightly slower than it should be, and the  same near perihelion, and therefore it is swifter than it should be at the middle elongations, as was also found before in Chapter 47.", "4327": "So too many of the distances seem to be collected near the apsides, and not as many as required, or not as long as required, about the middle elongations.", "4328": "But a consideration of this follows in its proper place.", "4329": "So, when I saw that the more skillfully and the more conveniently the physical causes, introduced in Ch.", "4330": "45, are called upon for directing the principles of calculation, the closer I always have approached to the true equations provided by the vicarious hypothesis of Ch.", "4331": "16, I greatly congratulated myself, and was confirmed in the opinion of Chapter 45.", "4332": "On the other hand, since I was revulsed at the multiple contrivances4 with which I contended in this chapter, I did not rest until I had established a more certain and direct way, and at the same time I began to suspect that what the opinion of Chapter 45 had required had in no way been achieved by the calculation.", "4333": "Chapter 49", "4334": "A critical examination of the previous method for the equations, and a more concise method, based upon the principles constituting the oval in the opinion of Chapter 45.", "4335": "So, in order to see the cause of the contrivance1 in this method, now fully presented, consider upon what foundations it rests.", "4336": "The planet is supposed to move uniformly on the epicycle, and to be swept around by the sun nonuniformly, according to the distance.", "4337": "From these two principles of motion, the oval path arises.", "4338": "But this method does not allow one to know what portion of the oval path corresponds to a given time, even if the distance of that portion be known, unless the length of the whole oval be known from the beginning.", "4339": "And the length of the oval cannot be known, except through the measure of the incursion of the planet from the circumference of the circle at the sides.", "4340": "But further, the measure of this incursion is not known before it is known what portion of the oval path is traversed in any given time.", "4341": "This, as you see, begs the question, and in our operation we presupposed what was being sought, namely, the length of the oval.", "4342": "This is not just a fault in our understanding, but is utterly alien to the primeval ordainer of the planetary courses: we have hitherto not found such an ungeometrical2 preconception3 in the rest of his works.", "4343": "Therefore a different approach must be taken for calling the opinion of Chapter 45 to the calculations, or if this cannot be done, the opinion itself will totter owing to its being suspected of circularity of argument.", "4344": "From this consideration the implication has occurred to us that in using the uniform measure of time, we divided the composite oval path into unequal parts, and thus measured out the parts of this composite oval, unequal  but equated again by the compensation of the distances, by the equal increments of time of the planet on all of them.", "4345": "And indeed, we had among our presuppositions that only the other power (that which is from the sun), intensifies according to distance, the power proper to the planet doing so not at all.", "4346": "But now, in this undertaking, we in a way encumber both forces with this relation to the distances, because we give the common work of the two, the oval, to the planet, according to the measure of the distances to be traversed.", "4347": "Therefore, although we have approached rather close to the truth in the effect of this method, we have nothing in which to glory that the opinion of Chapter 45 has been expressed by it if we are abandoned by reason.", "4348": "We would therefore have appeared to be going about our business more correctly if, dismissing the composite oval and the quadrature of its area, the subject matter of Chapters 46,47, and 48, we were to convert the calculation to the principles themselves of the oval path, assumed in Chapter 45.", "4349": "Let Chapter 45 be taken up again, and about A, the center of the sun's body, with radius AD, let the circle DG of the center of the epicycle be described; and another, with center A, and radius AB, the circle of the aphelion; in which AGB is the line of apsides, and let the planet, when it is at aphelion,4 be at B. Now let some time have passed from when the planet was at B, and let its measure be CDE, the angle on the epicycle, in order that as the aphelion of the epicycle B is translated to C, and the center of the epicycle G to D, the planet will have moved on the epicycle from C to E. Therefore, in order to know the angle DAB at the time CDE, consider that the planet has passed across from B to E by two powers.", "4350": "One made it move nearer the sun, and at the same time also drew it away from the line AC or AD, on which it had been previously, when AC was at AB.", "4351": "The other moved the planet forward along", "4352": "with the center of the epicycle, so that the center D of the epicycle was on the line AC, although it was formerly on AB.", "4353": "Now the power that drives the center of the epicycle around in a time designated by 360\u00b0, moves through 360\u00b0, or four right angles, about A, owing to the sum of 360 distances.", "4354": "Therefore, the sum of any number of distances being given from the time CDE, as before, the angle DAB will also be given.", "4355": "For the impression which the sun makes upon the body of the planet through the mediation of the distances", "4356": "AB, AE, is also presumed to make the same impression upon the center of the epicycle GD.", "4357": "This is because if the planet had not disengaged itself from the ray of power AB or AC and move towards B, but only descended towards the sun, it would then still be at the point F*  on AC, on which line the center of the epicycle D also lies.", "4358": "And it has disengaged itself by the law of the epicycle, at the distance DE and the angle CDE (for this is prescribed by the opinion of Chapter 45, under which we are operating here).", "4359": "Thus by a kind of fiction for itself it places the center of its epicycle at D. For we have said in Ch.", "4360": "39 how it is to be imagined that the power or fictitious radii of power AB,", "4361": "AC, and so on, serve as a position for the planet.", "4362": "Now, though, the ratio of the arcs BE of the oval path to the whole oval is not quite the same as the ratio of the corresponding arcs GD of the perfect circle to the whole circle.", "4363": "But neither is it true that as BC is to the whole perimeter of the circle BC so is the arc BF of the oval to the whole oval.", "4364": "But this should not stand in our way, for BE, and BF too, are composed of two powers, and if anything is disturbed in the proportion this comes from the planet's making its  own descent on the circumference of the epicycle (following the opinion of Chapter 45).", "4365": "For if the planet had remained at the highest point of its epicycle, and had been subject to the same motive force from the sun, adumbrated by AB, AE, which is nonuniform (which indeed cannot happen simultaneously, for when the distance of the planet from the sun remains the same, the motive strength from the sun remains the same), then a perfect arc of a greater circle BC would have been described, whose ratio to the whole BC is the same which the arc GD has to the whole GD.", "4366": "I am indeed aware that if the planet is supposed to be on a smaller perimeter, that of the center of the epicycle DG, it will go much faster.", "4367": "But that is not a reason for assigning a greater speed to the center of the epicycle.", "4368": "For, by supposition, the center of the epicycle moves, not in its own right, since it is not a body, but because of the planet.", "4369": "It is thus presupposed that the planet moves its own body away from the solar rays according to the law of the epicycle, and makes use of certain rays of power from the sun for its position (ideas which were indeed rejected in Ch.", "4370": "39, but taken up again in Ch.", "4371": "45 in considerably altered form, and which are retained here in order to explain my attempts).", "4372": "On this basis, the foundation of the subsequent calculation is sound, whatever its result might be.", "4373": "For the oval is present here no less than before, since DE and AB do not remain parallel.", "4374": "For to the extent that the long distances AB, AE exceed the medium distances AG, AD, the arc DG, or the angle DAG, is made less than the angle CDE, the measure of the time.", "4375": "Thus DE inclines towards B, and E consequently makes an incursion from the circumference of the circle towards BA.", "4376": "For by Chapter 2, if DE had remained parallel to AB, then E would have been on the circumference.", "4377": "This gives rise to the following method.", "4378": "Let the distances be found for each degree of mean anomaly.", "4379": "The method you have in Ch.", "4380": "39 above, and I also used it above in Ch.", "4381": "47 and 48.", "4382": "First, distances are found for nonintegral degrees of mean anomaly, or CE.", "4383": "Then, by interpolation, they are carried over to integral degrees of CE.", "4384": "If you find this meandering route annoying, and if the

time, which is the astronomers' mean anomaly, on the epicycle CE, from its aphelion C, in a direction opposite the series of signs ^5.", "4386": "Thus the angle ADE, or its supplement CDE, is given as a whole number of degrees of mean anomaly.", "4387": "The radius AD is also given as 100,000, and the radius of the epicycle DE is 9264.", "4388": "Therefore, part of the equation, DAE, will be given,

sum will be found to be about 36,075,562.", "4391": "For this sum was found using an eccentricity only slightly different from our present one, which is 9264.", "4392": "The 360th part of this has the value 100,210, and the same fraction of four right angles is one degree.", "4393": "Therefore, as each of the distances, in order, is to the distance 100,210, so is the arc of this distance 100,210 (60\u2019) to the arcs belonging to the other distances.", "4394": "For, as was frequently announced in Ch.", "4395": "39, 47, and 48, the ratio is inverse.", "4396": "Next, multiplying 60 minutes, or 3600 seconds, by 100,210, and dividing the product by each of the distances in the semicircle, 180 times, or  better, by half the sum of adjacent pairs of distances (following the advice given in Ch.", "4397": "48), yields the angles of the center of the epicycle, DAG.", "4398": "Next, beginning from the two least values of DAG, add them, and to the sum add the third, and again add the fourth to the sum of the three preceding, and so on, until you have accumulated all the 180 degrees.", "4399": "And if your final sum comes out to be exactly 180\u00b0 it will prove to you that you did everything right, never departing from the instructions.", "4400": "And let these sums of yours, which are the angles DAG, again be inscribed in a catalog with the corresponding mean anomalies in the margin, for ready reference.", "4401": "So, since an integral equation is to be computed, that is, the equated anomaly for a given mean anomaly, first, with the mean anomaly CDE measured on the epicycle, you extract the angle DAG or CAB from the latter catalog, the one with the sum of the angles.", "4402": "And with the same mean anomaly, you also extract the part of the equation CAE from

these equalities and the truth, it is to be attributed, not to the method of applying numbers, but to the opinion of Ch.", "4414": "45, whence these numbers flow.", "4415": "This is to say, not that the opinion itself has immediately become totally false, but just that we have been hasty.", "4416": "For instead of waiting for the plenary judgement of the observations, when we understood the planet's path to be oval we immediately seized upon  a certain quality for that oval, solely on account of the elegance of the physical causes and the graceful uniformity of the epicyclic motion,

absurd, and contrary to the hypothesis, which requires the planet to be slower at CD.", "4459": "The cause of this absurdity was immediately clear, namely, that in order to know the elapsed time for

distances themselves are longer, by Ch.", "4460": "32.", "4461": "Therefore, these distances had too small a numerical value.", "4462": "Nevertheless, in order that I not lose all this labor, I subtracted the excess of this number of the elapsed time over the number of the angle CAD, from CAD, so as to leave as a remainder EAD, 41\u00b0 13' 9\", and so that AC, AE might be equal.", "4463": "Here it was supposed that in the time CBD the planet traverses an angle EBD about the center of the eccentric B equal to CAD, and therefore, that as many distances from A were collected for the equal arcs ED of its eccentric as we found here on equal degrees of CAD.", "4464": "Thus, the same number of arcs which, in this calculation of ours, were spread out over CD, which were unequal and, in this locality, too great, are now understood to be compacted within the confines of arc ED,  now divided into equal parts.", "4465": "Therefore, the angle CBD would here be the mean anomaly of distance, giving the angle CAD, for finding the distances CA, from which the angle CAE, the physical slowing and translation of CA to EA, is deduced.", "4466": "Although it cannot show much of a discrepancy from the prior method of Chapter 49, this procedure assumes without demonstration that CAD and  EBD are equal, and consequently, that CA and EB are parallel, which was refuted above in the second

is greater, 9264 instead of 9165.", "4471": "Also, the planet was made to go too slowly near the apsides, and too fast near the middle elongations.", "4472": "But, dismissing this first method, which we seized upon by chance in thinking over the error committed at the beginning, let us turn to the implementation of the second method, born from a consideration of the same error.", "4473": "The distances scattered over CAD had approximately the same numerical value as the sector CBD, and led the argument to an absurdity (for just as the area CAD, an approximate measure of the distances, is greater than the area of the sector CBD, the numerical value of the distances CD also had to have been greater than the sector CBD).", "4474": "The question therefore followed: did the lines AF, AG proportional to AC, AD correctly express the elapsed time over CD, thus allowing CAD to remain the true equated anomaly?", "4475": "The answer is, they did not.", "4476": "For if so, AC will remain in its place, which is the same at which its length was computed.", "4477": "Therefore, the orbit will be a perfect circle, which was refuted in Ch.", "4478": "44.", "4479": "Therefore, the distances at the middle elongations, coming out longer than they should be, will make the planet slower than it should be there, and hence it will be faster at the apsides.", "4480": "But look at the result of the operation, which testifies to this itself.", "4481": "For", "4482": "First, the eccentricity is charged with being too small, since the maximum equation comes out to be 10\u00b0 29\u2155\u2019, which is 10\u00b0 34\u00bd\u2019 in the vicarious hypothesis.", "4483": "Second, at the time 52\u00b0 39\u2154\u2019 the planet is found to have traversed as much of its path from the apsis as was traversed in the vicarious in the longer time of 52\u00b0 53'.", "4484": "If the eccentricity were adjusted, all the values of the equated anomaly would be increased, so that, in the lower quadrant also, in the time of 37\u00b0 44' (the supplement of 142\u00b0 16', which has been adjusted by increasing the eccentricity), the planet will traverse as much of the path as it traverses in the vicarious in the longer time of 37\u00b0 51', which is the supplement of 142\u00b0 9': that is, both will traverse 45\u00b0, which is the supplement of 135\u00b0.", "4485": "By the way, this false hypothesis has come very close to giving us true results: the difference, after correction, is not more than 8' or 7' at either place.", "4486": "You thus see that results must not be trusted.", "4487": "And you will note again what  was observed in Ch.", "4488": "47, that the truth lies at the midpoint between these two methods (the latter of which describes a perfect circle, and the former an oval, following the opinion of Ch.", "4489": "45).", "4490": "Therefore, you can at least conclude now, as well as before in Ch.", "4491": "47, that the lunules to be cut off from the perfect circle have only half the breadth of the one that follows from the opinion of Ch.", "4492": "45.", "4493": "Third and fourth method", "4494": "So, since this second method did not accord with reason either, and in the first I learned that the distances are to be sought out corresponding to integral degrees of the angle CBD or to equal arcs of the eccentric CD, I also proceeded to the distances.", "4495": "So, fifth (I am enumerating for you only those operations each of which is performed 180 times), I made use of interpolation to relate the distances found previously by dividing the mean anomalies CBD minutewise, or unequally, to the mean anomalies which are equal or are of an integral number of degrees.", "4496": "But now, CBD no longer remained the [mean] anomaly, as it formerly was in the first method, but was made the eccentric anomaly by this relating of the distances, as it also is in the second method.", "4497": "Sixth, using the same distances as before, I sought out their proportionals, that is, the lines that are to the distances as the distances are to the radius, 100,000.", "4498": "But this was unnecessary.", "4499": "Still, I wanted to be aware of all the possibilities.", "4500": "Seventh and eighth, I again added the individual magnitudes, both of the distances AD, AC, and of their proportionals AG, AF.", "4501": "The sum of the distances came out to be 36,075,562.", "4502": "The reason for its coming out greater than 36,000,000 you have in Ch.", "4503": "40.", "4504": "The sum of the proportionals came out to 36,384,621.", "4505": "Now, in the previous diagram, we shall proceed demonstratively, using the equated anomaly CAD to obtain the eccentric anomaly CBD, and further, through this eccentric anomaly CBD learning the sum of the distances found on the arc CD.", "4506": "And by this sum of the distances, we shall obtain the elapsed time over the arc CD, or the mean anomaly.", "4507": "Or, in reverse order, for convenience's sake, if an angle CBD of an integral number of degrees (such as 45\u00b0) is used to find CAB, and 45 correct distances are obtained, these things, I say, follow demonstratively.", "4508": "But again, as before in the second method, CAD becomes the true equated anomaly, and thus CA remains in place, and the orbit DC will be a perfect circle.", "4509": "Since this is false, as was shown in Ch.", "4510": "44, it necessarily follows that the distances at the middle elongations are taken to be too long here, and consequently that the times are made longer than they should be, and shorter at the apsides.", "4511": "This method will in all respects be almost exactly equivalent to the previous method, using proportionals.", "4512": "For the number of distances we have gathered is now greater than before, to about the same extent that the proportionals, the same in number as the distances, were longer than the distances then.", "4513": "But, for safety's sake, witness the result of this calculation.", "4514": "For", "4515": "The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be.", "4516": "In other  respects, the errors are the same as in the preceding one.", "4517": "The reason why the signs for excess are turned into signs for defect, is that here the difference shows errors in the equated anomaly, while there they are in the mean anomaly.", "4518": "And this is the third method.", "4519": "In substituting the proportionals AG, AF for the distances AD, AC, which is the fourth method, we are going to make the two parts of the equation into three.", "4520": "For the area CAD measures the sum of the distances CA, DA.", "4521": "It is therefore much less than the sum of the lines FA, GA.", "4522": "And even if we attempt a remedy like the one used on the first method, we shall still have doubled our errors.", "4523": "For since the distances themselves cannot be admitted, owing to their excessive length at the middle elongations, the proportionals will be even less tolerable, since they are longer.", "4524": "And if you want to test them with the results of a calculation, you will find that to a mean anomaly of 53\u00b0 23' 56\" there corresponds an equated anomaly of 46\u00b0 0', which in the vicarious hypothesis comes out to be about 45\u00b0 27', a difference of 33', clearly absurd.", "4525": "Fifth and sixth method", "4526": "So, since I accomplished nothing with these four methods, I then took the mean anomaly and the distances assigned to it (in the fifth operation) and went over to the table of the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16, and the true equated anomaly.", "4527": "Let the second diagram in Chapter 46 be taken up again.", "4528": "Then, the distances AF belonging to integral degrees of mean anomaly IBF or IDH, also belong to the degrees and minutes of the equated anomaly IAH, which in the table mentioned corresponded to the mean anomaly IDH itself.", "4529": "Therefore,", "4530": "Ninth, I related these distances obtained from the minutewise equated anomalies of the vicarious hypothesis of Ch.", "4531": "16, that is, from the unequal angles HAI, to the individual integral degrees of the equated anomaly HAI, that is, to equal parts.", "4532": "Tenth, with the same distances, thus set up, I sought the [third] proportionals, as in the second and sixth operations.", "4533": "Eleventh and twelfth, I added each, according to its kind, and the sum of the distances was 35,770,014, and the sum of the proportionals, 35,692,048.", "4534": "In this translation of distances we moved all the long ones upwards, and made them fewer, establishing large arcs IG of the oval path above, at aphelion, and thus attributing the individual distances to the individual degrees, not of the anomaly FAB, as in the first method, but of HAB, which is the true equated anomaly.", "4535": "There are no more of these degrees in the upper semicircle than in the lower.", "4536": "Therefore, there are now more of the short distances than there are of the long ones, whence it not only happens that the sum of the 360 distances comes out smaller than the sum of the 360 diameters, but also the sum of the proportionals comes out smaller than was the sum of the distances themselves.", "4537": "So, in the matter of the fifth method and the sums of the distances,  reason again cries out against the method of basing equations upon it.", "4538": "Let the diagram belonging to this chapter be repeated, and let it be recalled to mind what was said about the first method.", "4539": "For in it the equated anomaly of distance CAD was divided into equal degrees.", "4540": "Hence it happened that CD was divided into unequal and [excessively] large parts, and had too few distances.", "4541": "From this, seizing upon a sort of accidental remedy for the error, we concluded from the sum of the distances on CD that to those distances belonged a shorter arc ED, so as to transfer AC over to AE, and thus ED could be obtained divided into equal parts with a distance established at any of its degrees.", "4542": "However, it was not from the sum of the distances found on CD, but from a mingling of the vicarious hypothesis with the hypothesis of the distances framed in Chapter 46, that the translation of AC to AE was now made and perfected, and the arc ED was attributed to the mean anomaly (which we have numbered on the  arc CD for finding the distance CA or EA).", "4543": "And this was nonetheless done in such a way that BE and AC are not exactly parallel, as in the first method.", "4544": "And now that this has been done by a mingling of hypotheses, as I was saying, there is no need to go through the operation again, as in the first method.", "4545": "Instead, only one thing needs to be found: do the few distances AC, AE gathered into one sum in this fifth method, produce the same physical equation that resulted artificially from the two mingled hypotheses?", "4546": "Consider here how the distances are arranged in this last procedure.", "4547": "The angle EAD, whose terminus E is at distance AC from the sun, was divided into equal degrees in this last procedure, to each of which was given a distance.", "4548": "In this way the arc ED of the oval path standing upon the angle EAD ends up divided into unequal parts, and it receives too few distances.", "4549": "So the mean anomaly already given from the vicarious hypothesis cannot be had from the sum of the distances on EAD.", "4550": "Now in the first method above, when CD received too few distances, with the angle CAD divided into equal degrees we substituted ED for CD as the arc suited to those distances.", "4551": "So similarly, in this fifth method, since ED has received too few distances, with the angle EAD divided into equal degrees, if it is permissible again to make use of a clumsy remedy, we would substitute ND for ED, as the arc to which those distances belong.", "4552": "In order to find the distance CA let the mean anomaly CBD be 48\u00b0 44'.", "4553": "Given angle B, and CB, BA, CA is given as 105,784,3 and CAB as 45\u00b0.", "4554": "The vicarious hypothesis requires AC to be transferred to AE.", "4555": "And we now divide ED, which the vicarious hypothesis declares to be 41\u00b0 22', into equal degrees, and through them we collected no more than 41 distances and part of a 42nd.", "4556": "And these, gathered into a single sum, will constitute a mean anomaly which is by no means equal to the one first taken, DC, but is equal to another, DO, which shows the distance AO, to be transferred to AN.", "4557": "\"Work was begun on an amphora; why has a pitcher come forth from the whirling wheel?", "4558": "\"4 For the question was whether all the distances on the equal degrees of ED, gathered into a sum, would show the mean anomaly DC.", "4559": "But the operation gave me an answer concerning ND, and the anomaly DO.", "4560": "Finally, let us turn to the sixth method, and the proportionals that are  adapted to the demonstration of Ch.", "4561": "32.", "4562": "For the true quantities of orbital arcs that appear equal from the center of the sun are in the ratio of the distances: thus to the extent that AE is longer, so is ED.", "4563": "But the times of truly equal arcs, as measured on the orbit, are also in the ratio of the distances.", "4564": "For to the extent that ED is farther away from A, the planet also takes longer to traverse the arc ED.", "4565": "Therefore, the times that the planet accumulates on those arcs that appear equal from the center of the sun, are in the duplicate ratio of the distances.", "4566": "But AF is to AH likewise in the duplicate ratio of the distance AC or AE to the mean AH.", "4567": "And so the measures of the times that the planet accumulates over equal degrees of the angle EAD are the proportional lines AG, AF, belonging to the integral degrees or equal parts of the angle of true equated anomaly EAD.", "4568": "Therefore, let the proportionals to the distances at equal degrees of equated anomaly be tested, just as other distances were also tested above in this chapter.", "4569": "As, since 35,692,048, the sum of all 360 distances, at all 360 equal parts of the angle at the sun, is equivalent to an elapsed time of 360\u00b0, what is the value of a just and correct sum at any given degree of equated anomaly?", "4570": "In this manner is found", "4571": "The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be.", "4572": "With  this corrected, the difference above, at 41\u00b0, will be about 8'+, and below, about 7\u00bd\u2019\u2014.", "4573": "Thus here, too, the planet is not made to go fast enough at the apsides, and so there are too many distances near the apsides, and consequently less than there should be at the middle elongations.", "4574": "But it comes quite close to the truth, and clearly coincides with the method of Chapter 49.", "4575": "For if you consider well, the same thing is done here as was done in Ch.", "4576": "49.", "4577": "There we computed the optical part of the equation by itself, and the physical part also by itself, while here we are computing them both together.", "4578": "There we had introduced fictitious rays of power in order to be able also to ascribe to the epicycle its own task of disengaging itself from those fictitious rays (for in the truth of the matter no rays go around as slowly as the center of the planetary epicycle goes, as was said in Ch.", "4579": "39).", "4580": "And nevertheless, we left all the physical force carrying the planet around (as concerns the effect) to the sun, so that the epicycle would only serve to adjust the distances.", "4581": "Here, we made use of the same power of the sun for the physical translation, while we again computed the distances from the epicycle, and gave its equal parts to equal times, that is, to equal degrees of mean anomaly, as the opinion of Ch.", "4582": "45 maintains.", "4583": "And if we ended up taking as many distances in any given part of the time as there are degrees of equated anomaly, they are still derived from the distances of the mean anomaly, and in length they are the same.", "4584": "And this form is so much easier that we can here put  aside the other persuasion concerning the planet's epicyclic motion, and take one step closer to the truth of the physical cause, leaving to the epicyclic mode nothing but a reciprocation on the diameter\u2014although this is still flawed, as has was clear from these equations, at least.", "4585": "For, as was noted just above in considering the second method, this preoccupation with epicyclic motion is excessive, showing distances at the middle elongations that are too small, from which it happens that at that place the planet exceeds its measure of velocity, and at the apsides falls short of its measure.", "4586": "But it suffices us to express the opinion of Ch.", "4587": "45 in our calculation.", "4588": "Therefore, although one might here raise the objection from Ch.", "4589": "32 that this ratio of diurnal motions cannot be constant, since the parts of the eccentric near the apsides are presented directly to the sun, and the intermediate are presented obliquely, so that they thus appear differently from the way they would if they were presented directly\u2014 if anyone, I say, were to raise this objection, I shall answer as I did in Ch.", "4590": "49, that this obliquity at the intermediate parts is added by the planet in its own right, and is produced through its descent.", "4591": "Thus, it is not to be imputed to the motive cause arising from the sun, nor is it affected by that cause.", "4592": "Therefore, studious reader, from such a great number of chapters and methods, you have only two methods of equating that conform to the opinion of Ch.", "4593": "45.", "4594": "One is by the physical hypothesis intermingled with an epicycle set up on the longitude, described in Ch.", "4595": "49.", "4596": "The other is by this chapter, and its sixth method, in accordance with a more purely physical hypothesis, where the epicycle governs nothing but the descent towards the sun, or if anyone should wish to set it up to affect the latitude, [the epicycle should be] perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.", "4597": "And both of these two use different means to produce the same effect.", "4598": "You will thus be able to place confidence in them more safely when examining the opinion of Chapter 45.", "4599": "And through a hitherto empty trust in the true physical causes that have been discovered, let a triumph over Mars once again be celebrated.", "4600": "Now, some rumor, I know not what, calls me to new tumults and new labors ^5.", "4601": "Chapter 51", "4602": "Distances of Mars from the sun are explored and compared, at an equal distance from aphelion on either semicircle; and at the same time the trustworthiness of the vicarious hypothesis is explored.", "4603": "While I am thus celebrating a triumph over the motions of Mars, and fetter him in the prison of tables and the leg-irons of eccentric equations, considering him utterly defeated, it is announced in various places that the victory is futile, and war is breaking out again with full force.", "4604": "For while the enemy was in the house as a captive, and hence lightly esteemed, he burst all the chains of the equations and broke out of the prison of the tables.", "4605": "That is, no method administered geometrically under the rule of the opinion of Ch.", "4606": "45 was able to emulate in numerical accuracy the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16 (which has true equations derived from false causes).", "4607": "Outdoors, meanwhile, spies positioned throughout the whole circuit of the eccentric\u2014I mean the true distances\u2014have overthrown my troops of physical causes called forth from Ch.", "4608": "45, and have  shaken off their yoke, retaking liberty.", "4609": "And now there was not much to prevent the fugitive enemy's joining forces with his fellow rebels and reducing me to desperation, unless I had sent new reinforcements of physical reasoning in a hurry to the scattered, straggling veterans, and, informed with all diligence, had stuck to the trail without delay in the direction whither the captive had

that the more we descend from the apsides, the more the computed distances fall short of the observed distances, a result quite the opposite of what we saw in Ch.", "5112": "44 above.", "5113": "For there, the distances computed according to the law of the circle were longer than the observed distances at the middle elongations, while here, the distances resulting from the hypothesis that makes the planet's orbit oval are shorter.", "5114": "It is therefore obvious that the planet's path is neither a circle nor such as to make as great an incursion from the circle at the sides as does the oval that arose from the opinion of Chapter 45 and was described in Chapter 46; but takes a middle course.", "5115": "And if, in turn, using the distances of Chapter 45, you compute the observed positions of Mars, especially those which, in Ch.", "5116": "53, stood at some distance on either side of opposition, the planet before opposition will fall too far forward, and after opposition, too far back.", "5117": "This is most evident in the descending semicircle in 1589 and 1591, and in the ascending semicircle in 1582 and 1595.", "5118": "For in those places, the oval of Chapter 45 is 660 units1 too small, while the perfect circle is too large by the same amount, and this can have an effect upon the appearances of 20 minutes and more.", "5119": "Thus, David Fabricius2 was able to use his observations to charge my hypothesis of Chapter 45, which I had communicated to him as true, with this error of having distances that are too short at the middle elongations, writing at the very time when I was laboring to seek out the true hypothesis with renewed care.", "5120": "He was, in fact, quite close to arriving at the truth before me ^3.", "5121": "And since the perfect circle errs the same amount in the opposite direction, we argue rightly from this that the truth is in the middle, between the two.", "5122": "Moreover, the equations computed from physical causes in Chapters 49 and 50 gave the same testimony, namely, that the lunule cut off from the perfect semicircle ought to have only half the breadth of the one which the opinion of Chapter 45 cuts off.", "5123": "Therefore, nothing prevents our saying that the matter is most certainly demonstrated: that the opinion of Chapter 45, in remedying the excess of the perfect circle, falls into the opposite defect.", "5124": "So the physical causes of Ch.", "5125": "45 go up in smoke.", "5126": "Chapter 56", "5127": "Demonstration from the observations already introduced, that the distances of Mars from the sun are to be chosen as if from the diameter of the epicycle.", "5128": "The breadth of the lunule of Chapter 46 above, which the opinion of  Chapter 45, which instructed us to cut it off from the semicircle, has produced for us\u2014this breadth, I say, was found to be 858 units,1 of which the semidiameter of the circle is 100,000.", "5129": "But then, by two arguments, which I have already presented in Chapters 49, 50, and 55, I concluded plainly that the breadth of the lunule is to be taken as only half that, namely, 429, or more correctly, 432, and in units of which the semidiameter of Mars is 152,350, nearly 660.", "5130": "I therefore began to think of the causes and the manner by which a lunule of such a breadth might be cut off.", "5131": "While anxiously turning this thought over in my mind, reflecting that absolutely nothing was articulated by Chapter 45, and consequently my triumph over Mars was futile, quite by chance I hit upon the secant of the angle 5\u00b0 18', which is the measure of the greatest optical equation.", "5132": "And when I saw that this was 100,429, it was as if I were awakened from sleep to see a new light, and I began to reason thus.", "5133": "At the middle elongations the optical part of the equation becomes a maximum.", "5134": "At the middle elongations the lunule or shortening of the distances is greatest, and has the same magnitude as the excess of the secant of the greatest optical equation 100,429 over the radius 100,000.", "5135": "Therefore, if the radius is substituted for the secant at the middle elongation, this accomplishes what the observations suggest.", "5136": "And, in the diagram in Chapter 40,1 have concluded generally that if you use HR instead of HA, VR instead of VA, and substitute EB for EA, and so on for all of them, the effect on the rest of the eccentric positions will be the same as what was done here at the middle elongations.", "5137": "And by equivalence, in the small diagram of Chapter 39, \u03b1\u03ba will be taken instead of the lines \u03b1\u03b4 or \u03b1\u03b9, and \u03b1\u03bc for \u03b1\u03b5 or \u03b1\u03bb.", "5138": "And so the reader should peruse Chapter 39 again.", "5139": "He will find that what the observations additionally testify here was already urged there, from natural causes, namely, that it appears reasonable that the planet perform some sort of reciprocation, moving on the diameter, as if of an epicycle, that is always directed towards the sun.", "5140": "He will also find that there is nothing more at odds with this notion than this: that when we proposed to represent a perfect circle, we were forced to make the highest parts \u03b3\u03b9 of the reciprocation unequal to the lowest \u03bb\u03b6, which parts correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the highest being short, and the lowest long.", "5141": "So, now that the planet's circular path is denied, and \u03ba\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b1 are taken instead of \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, that is, instead of \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, as was said, it follows further that those parts of the reciprocation, such as \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6, are equal.", "5142": "And that which had tormented us for a long time in Chapter 39 now surrenders to us in the face of the proof of the truth we have perceived.", "5143": "As for the middle parts \u03ba\u03bc still being larger than the extremes \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6, it will", "5144": "be said in Chapter 57 following that this is in accord with nature, contrary to what we had been able to understand in Chapter 39.", "5145": "But in addition, the difficulty that arose in Chapter 39 through supposing that the increase of the sun's [apparent] diameter serve the planet as an index for its approaching and receding, now vanishes entirely, as will appear in Chapter 57.", "5146": "Thus, concerning the eccentric anomaly of 90\u00b0, I easily was able to see in the manner just mentioned, that instead of the distance EA of the perfect circle, EB is to be taken, corresponding to an equated anomaly EAB.", "5147": "And although I have drawn a general conclusion concerning all the anomalies using a single one as an example, this was not a consequence just of that one anomaly: there was need to strengthen it using closely spaced observations.", "5148": "So now you understand the special capacity in which the observations of Chapters 51 and 53 are appointed to serve us, namely, to give this evidence.", "5149": "Come, then: let the eccentric anomalies CBG, CBH be computed at the equated anomalies set out in those chapters, that is, at the angles CAG, CAH, and so on.", "5150": "Nor is there any need to strive after minute parts, nor be concerned about the imperfection of the eccentric equations that still

equal arcs on the eccentric, the planet comes to be  at the diametral distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, instead of the circumferential distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1 (that is, \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1), upon which the perfect circle lies.", "5179": "It is clear from inspection that a lunule is cut off from the perfect semicircle of the eccentric, whose breadth at any point is equal to the differences between the two diverse distances, such as \u03b9\u03ba, \u03bb\u03bc.", "5180": "This is proposed not on the basis of arguments a priori, but of observations, as I have just said; so now the physical theories will proceed more correctly than they had hitherto.", "5181": "***  For it is not by any ratiocinative or mental process that a planetary mind assigns the equal parts of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bc, \u03bc\u03b6, to equal arcs CD, DE, EF, of the as yet untraversed eccentric, for the former are not equal.", "5182": "Instead, the reciprocation is coordinated with the space traversed on the eccentric in a natural way, which depends not upon the equality of the angles DBC, EBD, FBE, but upon the strength**1  of the ever increasing angle DBC, EBC, FBC, which strength approximates the sine (so called by the geometers).", "5183": "The ascent\u2019s being changed into descent thereby gradually, by a continuous diminution, is more probably than if the planet were said suddenly to turn its prow in the other direction \u2013 which we indeed said in Ch.", "5184": "39 clearly conflicts with observational results.", "5185": "And since the measure of this reciprocation points the finger at a natural mode, its cause will also be natural; that is, it will be some natural \u2013 or better, corporeal \u2013 faculty, and not a planetary mind.", "5186": "Also in Ch.", "5187": "39, for the best reasons, one of our suppositions was that a planet cannot make a transition from place to place by the bare effort of its  inherent forces unless these be assisted or directed by an extrinsic force.", "5188": "This being the case, we must consider whether we should also carry over this reciprocation in part to the solar power itself.", "5189": "In our exertions to this end, we shall  be obliged once again to take up our oars which were introduced in Ch.", "5190": "39 ^2.", "5191": "Let there be a circular river CDE, FGH, and in it a sailor who revolves his oar once in twice the periodic time of the planet, by an inherent and perfectly uniform force.", "5192": "Thus at C let the line of the oar be at right angles to the line from the sun, and let it direct now the bow and now the stern forward at alternate returns.", "5193": "At F, however, let the line of the oar be part of the line from the sun, and at other positions let it have an intermediate inclination.", "5194": "Now the stream, flowing down upon the oar at DE, will push the ship3 down towards A, while from C it will push very little, since the ship is also but slightly inclined.", "5195": "The same is true at F, because at this moment the stream strikes the oar directly.", "5196": "At D and E, however, it pushes down more strongly, because here the oar is greatly disposed to such an approach by its inclination.", "5197": "The opposite happens in the ascending semicircle.", "5198": "For the river, coming beneath the oar at G and H, drives it away from the sun.", "5199": "At the same time it will also happen, other things being equal, that the impulse is less at C than at F, since our river is weak at C and strong at F.", "5200": "And this is is also in accordance with our wishes, since our reciprocation was following equal spaces on the eccentric, and the planet spends longer in the upper ones than in the lower.", "5201": "This example shows only the possibility of this arrangement.", "5202": "In itself it  is rather inadequate, since the rotations of the oar and the river are accomplished, not in the same time, but a double time.", "5203": "Furthermore, to those looking at them from earth, the faces of the planets should appear to change, while the face of the moon, although it participates with the planets in that motion which we are discussing, does not change over the course of a month.", "5204": "Instead, it always is turned towards the earth, whence its eccentricity is reckoned.", "5205": "In addition, while the force of a river is material (for its water acts by its weight and material impetus), the force of the sun is immaterial.", "5206": "Therefore, the comparison with the planets ought to be different: they will need no oar, no physical instrument, for catching hold of the force of some weighty thing (for that motive species of the sun has no weight).", "5207": "Nor do we deem it fitting that the stars have a corporeal oar, seeing that we hold them to be round.", "5208": "But from this very refutation, there comes another example, which will perhaps be more suitable.", "5209": "The river and the oar are of the same quality.", "5210": "The river is an immaterial species of magnetic power in the sun.", "5211": "So why not have the oar too borrow something from the magnet?", "5212": "What if all the bodies of the planets are enormous round magnets?", "5213": "Of the earth (one of the planets, for  Copernicus) there is no doubt.", "5214": "William Gilbert has proved it.", "5215": "But to describe this power more plainly, the planet\u2019s globe has two poles, of which one will seek out the sun, and the other will flee the  sun.", "5216": "So let us imagine an axis of this sort as a magnetic strip, and let its point seek the sun.", "5217": "But despite its sunseeking magnetic nature, let it remain ever parallel to itself in the translational motion of the globe, except to the extent that over the ages it transfers the polar inclination from one of the fixed  stars to another, thus causing the progressive motion of the aphelion.", "5218": "I nevertheless admit the possibility that a mind may be needed for both of these, of such a nature as to be adequately instructed by the animate faculty for performing this motion.", "5219": "For this is a motion, not of the entire body from place to place (which motion, in Ch.", "5220": "39 above, was rightly denied to a motive cause inherent in the planets),4 but of the parts about the center of the whole, as if at rest.", "5221": "Here again, in the globe of the earth there is an example of this directional property of the axis, from Copernicus.", "5222": "For as long as the axis of the earth, in the annual circulation of its center, remains almost perfectly equidistant from  itself in all its positions, summer and winter are brought about.", "5223": "* On the other hand, insofar as very long ages cause it to incline, the fixed stars are thought to move forward, and the equinoxes to retrogress.", "5224": "Why, then, should we have doubts about attributing to all the planets, in order to save the phenomena of eccentricity, something that is observed to be in one of them (that is, the earth) because of the phenomena of the precession of the equinoxes and the sun's annual cycle of rising and falling?", "5225": "Copernicus, for example, was deceived here when he thought that he needed a special principle to cause the earth to reciprocate annually from north to south and back so as to produce summer and winter, and to bring about the equality of the tropical and sidereal years (to the extent that they are equal) by constructing it in a manner commensurate with its revolution.", "5226": "For all those effects are obtained by having the earth\u2019s axis, about which the diurnal motion is made, retain a single, constant direction: there is no need for extrinsic causes, except to account only for the extremely slow precession of the equinoxes.", "5227": "And so here, too, there is on no account any need for movers for the planet, which would carry its body about the sun in a parallel position, and at the same time perform the reciprocation.", "5228": "For the one will naturally depend upon the other.", "5229": "The only thing remaining to be considered is the extremely slow progression of the aphelia.", "5230": "To continue: when the strip is at C and F, there is no reason why the planet  should approach or recede, since it holds its ends at equal distances from the sun, and would undoubtedly turn its point towards the sun if it were allowed to do so by the force that holds its axis straight and parallel.", "5231": "When the planet moves away from C, the point approaches the sun perceptibly, and the tail end recedes.", "5232": "Therefore, the globe begins perceptibly to navigate towards the sun.", "5233": "After F, the tail end perceptibly approaches, and the head end recedes from the sun.", "5234": "Therefore, by a natural aversion, the whole globe perceptibly flees the sun.", "5235": "And when it is opposite A, where the length of the axis is pointed directly at the sun, its approach in the former situation, or its flight in the latter, is strongest.", "5236": "Furthermore, our earlier presuppositions derived from the observations postulated this.", "5237": "For there, of the parts of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bc, \u03bc\u03b6 which correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the parts at the middle, such as \u03ba\u03bc, were longest, and those near \u03b3 and \u03b6 were short.", "5238": "But it is also consistent that the observations would have \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6 equal, although their arcs \u03b3\u03b4, \u03b5\u03b6, or better, CD, EF on the eccentric, though equal, are traversed in unequal times, longer for CD, so that the part of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba is traversed in a longer time than \u03bc\u03b6 which is equal to it.", "5239": "For similarly, magnets approach one another more slowly when they are at a greater interval, and more swiftly and more quickly at a shorter interval.", "5240": "In fact, we can transfer that force which keeps the  magnetic axis in a parallel position, and does not allow it to remain pointed  towards the sun, from the attention of a mind, to which we had entrusted it a little earlier, to the functions of nature.", "5241": "It appears to be an objection to this, that nature always acts in one and the same way, while this retentive force appears to make its exertions differently at different times.", "5242": "This is seen, for  example, in the tendency of the axis to incline towards the sun, for the impeding of which the retentive force is ordained, which tendency is evanescent at the middle elongations but most strongly evident at aphelion and perihelion.", "5243": "Nevertheless, what is there to prevent this force of retention's being in many places stronger than the tendency to incline towards the sun, so that the force is either not at all or but little wearied by such a weak adversary?", "5244": "Let us again  take an example from the magnet.", "5245": "In it are manifestly mingled two powers, one of directing it towards the pole, and the other of seeking iron.", "5246": "Thus if a strip or nautical needle be directed towards the pole, while some iron approach from the side, the needle quickly declines from the pole and inclines towards the iron, thus indulging somewhat in its intimacy with the iron, but in such a way that it gives most of it to the pole.", "5247": "Indeed, Gilbert thinks this  to be the reason why a strip declines from the pole towards the continents of greatest magnitude, the cause of this declination thus lying in the tracts of land, being greater and having a more vigorous power in the vicinity to the extent that they are higher on the right or left.", "5248": "Therefore, we can ascribe the same tasks and a uniform action to both  natural faculties, and by the interplay of the two we can show a cause for the translation of the aphelia which will be neither obscure, nor, by Hercules, imaginary.", "5249": "For suppose that this force of directing the axis towards the sun does detract somewhat from the retentive power, commensurate with the ratio of the two.", "5250": "Accordingly, in the aphelial semicircle, as at C, the point will gradually incline towards H (that is, backward), and the tail end will turn away from the sun, gradually overcoming the retentive force.", "5251": "Thus the aphelion will become retrograde.", "5252": "But in the perihelial semicircle, as at F, the same point will incline towards G (that is, forward), again overcoming the contrary retentive force.", "5253": "Thus the aphelion will then be made to move forward, and to be fast.", "5254": "But because AF is shorter than AC, and the sun is closer to F than to C, the force tending to turn the magnetic axis towards the sun is therefore stronger at F than at C. Thus more will be detracted from the retentive [force] at F than at C. So the perihelial forward inclination not only compensates for  the aphelial backward inclination, but even overcomes it.", "5255": "And so the reason is clear why the apsides progress, and do not retrogress.", "5256": "Thus the aphelion we have found will have that value only at an equated anomaly of 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0 when the axis of power is directed straight at the sun, which is its correct place.", "5257": "And the motion of the aphelion will be spiral, as will become clear below in Chapter 68 for the motion of precession of the equinoxes also, which exists through another cause.", "5258": "So the direction of the magnetic axis in its parallel position, or the force which is its custodian, will not respect one or another of the fixed stars, but only the position of its body, as it is at any particular time.", "5259": "And, to think the matter through simply: because this direction is more like rest than motion, it is more appropriately sought in the material, and in the disposition of the body, than in some mind.", "5260": "But come: let us track more closely this similarity of the planetary  reciprocation to the motion of a magnet, and that by a most beautiful geometrical demonstration, so that it may be clear that magnets have such a motion as that which we perceive in the planet.", "5261": "Let DFA be either a round magnet or the body of Mars, DA the line along which the magnetic power is oriented, D the pole that seeks the sun, A the pole that flees the sun.", "5262": "You will note, first, that in this theory it is all the same whether we consider the entire globe of the magnetic body, or one single physical line of its power, parallel to DA.", "5263": "For this magnetic power is corporeal, and divisible with the body, as the  Englishman Gilbert, B. Porta, and others, have proved,5 surely because its globe consists of an infinite number of physical lines, as it were, parallel to DA, whose power is extended in a straight line and in one direction in the world.", "5264": "Therefore, the judgements made about individual parts with respect to the quality of their motion will be the same as those concerning them all joined together, and vice versa.", "5265": "So let the central axis DA be proposed for theorizing, in place of the whole body and all its filaments.", "5266": "Let DA be bisected at B, and let FBI be drawn perpendicular to DA.", "5267": "Thus, when the planet is so positioned that BI points toward the center of the sun, there will be no [tendency to] approach.", "5268": "For the angles DBI, ABI are equal, and thus have equal strength, the former for approaching, and the latter for receding.", "5269": "So this is like an equipoise in mechanics ^6.", "5270": "Under these conditions, the center of Mars B is on the apsides, at aphelion, say, at its greatest distance from the sun.", "5271": "Now let some arc IC be taken, measuring the angle of equated anomaly, and let BC be drawn and extended to K. And let the planet be so situated that BC points towards the sun, which is understood to be indicated by K. The first  thing to be sought is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach.", "5272": "Now the approach occurs because the seeking pole D is inclined towards the sun K at the angle DBK, while the fleeing pole A is turned away at the angle ABK.", "5273": "And since the strength of this angle is natural, it will follow the same ratio as the balance.", "5274": "But  when a line CP is drawn from C perpendicular to DA, between DP and PA there will be the ratio of the balance.", "5275": "For if a pair of scales is suspended from the balance support KB, and the arms come to rest at the angle DBK, the weight of the arm BD will be to the weight of the arm BA as DP is to PA, just as, if the balance arms were suspended from CP at P, and the weight of the arm BA were applied to PD while the weight of BD were applied to PA, then DA would be at right angles to the hanging balance support CP.", "5276": "See my Optics,7 and do not be easily swayed by insufficiently  careful experimentation.", "5277": "Therefore, as DP is to PA, so is the strength of angle ABC to the strength of angle DBC.", "5278": "Thus DP here measures the force of fleeing, and PA the seeking force.", "5279": "From PA subtract a magnitude equal to DP, and let this be AS.", "5280": "Therefore, SP is the measure of the seeking power alone, with the impediment of fleeing [power] subtracted, and it will be in the same proportion in which AD measures the single greatest force.", "5281": "But where the half DB measures the greatest force, the half of PS, which is PB, or the sine CN of the equated anomaly CBI, measures the net force of the planet's approach towards the sun at this location.", "5282": "So the sine of the equated anomaly is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach towards the sun in this place.", "5283": "And this is the measure of the increments of power.", "5284": "The measure of the distance of the reciprocation traversed by these continuous increments of power is quite another thing.", "5285": "For the observations show that if the eccentric anomaly GI corresponds to the equated anomaly IC, the versed sine IH of the arc GI is the measure of the reciprocation accomplished.", "5286": "If this can also be deduced from the previously indicated measure of the speed CN, then we shall have reconciled experience with the demonstration involving the balance.", "5287": "Since the sine of any arc is the measure of the strength of that angle, the sum of the sines will be an approximate measure of the sum of the strengths or impressions over all the equal parts of the circle.", "5288": "And the completion of the entire reciprocation is the effect of all of these in common.", "5289": "Furthermore, letting IC and IG,  though they are unequal elsewhere, be equal here to avoid confusion, the sum of the sines of the arc IG is to the sum of the sines over the quadrant, approximately as the versed sine IH of that arc IG is to the versed sine IB of the quadrant.", "5290": "Approximately, I say.", "5291": "For at the beginning, when both the versed sine and its increments are small, it is less by half than the sum of the sines.", "5292": "For: Let the quadrant be taken as 90 units.", "5293": "The sum of the 90 sines is 5,789,431 ^8.", "5294": "In this instance I have added them all in order ^9.", "5295": "The sum of the sines at an arc of 1\u00b0, that is, the first sine, is 1745.", "5296": "And the former sum is to the latter as 100,000 is to 30.", "5297": "On the other hand, the versed sine of the quadrant is 100,000, and the versed sine of 1 degree is 15, which is half of 30.", "5298": "The reader should not be at all deterred by this geometrical faux pas10 and  fallacious principle.", "5299": "For before this becomes a perceptible portion of the reciprocation, the effects of the two procedures differ imperceptibly.", "5300": "For the sum of 15 sines, which is 208,166, gives 359411 [as a fourth proportional].", "5301": "And the versed sine of 15\u00b0 gives 3407/100,000, which is only a little less than the other.", "5302": "Likewise, the sum of 30 sines, which is 792,598, shows, by the rule of proportions, a part of the reciprocation which is 13,691 out of 100,000.", "5303": "And the versed sine of 30\u00b0 shows 13,397.", "5304": "Also, the sum of 60 sines, which is 2,908,017, shows a little more than 50,000, while the versed sine of 60\u00b0 is 50,000 ^12.", "5305": "It has been demonstrated that if any magnet be set out as we have  supposed the bodies of the planets to be set out in the heavens with respect to the sun, a reciprocation of the magnetic body will result that is such as is measured by the versed sine, as regards the space traversed.", "5306": "And indeed, the observations testify that the planet's body reciprocates according to the measure of the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly.", "5307": "It is therefore perfectly consistent that the bodies of the planets be magnetic, and so disposed to the sun as we have described.", "5308": "I must now show that it was not a great mistake to have taken the arcs IC  and IG as equal.", "5309": "When I say that the arc IC on the body of the planet is the measure  of the equated anomaly, I am speaking properly, and CN is then the genuine measure of the strength possessed by the planet when it has the sun on the line BK.", "5310": "However, when I say that IG is the measure of the eccentric anomaly which corresponds to the [equated] anomaly IC, I am speaking improperly, incorrectly using the circle of the planet's body to represent the eccentric.", "5311": "But on the eccentric's descending semicircle, since a greater arc of eccentric anomaly corresponds to  a smaller arc of equated anomaly (namely, IG to IC), we will be adding up considerably more sines on IG than on IC, and rightly so.", "5312": "For since the sine measures the strength, and the strength acts in proportion to the time and to the closeness to the sun (magnets being stronger when closer)\u2014that is, to put it briefly, in proportion to the arc IG\u2014just as many sines should be set up on IC as are found on IG.", "5313": "Our only error is this, that we take those many sines to be longer than they should be, as GH is longer than CN.", "5314": "But first of all this excess is in itself very small and imperceptible.", "5315": "For at the beginning of the quadrant the arcs IC and IG hardly differ, and the sines are small, and at the end of the quadrant, where the eccentric equation CG is greatest, the sines hardly differ.", "5316": "And then this error is in accord with our wishes.", "5317": "For the sums of the sines  always come out a little greater than the versed sines; and here we are keen to accommodate and reconcile the libratory and magnetic ratios to those commended by experience.", "5318": "Therefore, this present error of ours, of accumulating long sines instead of short ones, is avoided if we use the versed sines instead of the sums of the sines themselves, for the sums of the sines are not exactly equal to the versed sines, but exceed them because of the effect of the reciprocation.", "5319": "Therefore, by the best reasoning at our disposal, we have brought the calculation within the limits of observable error ^13.", "5320": "Let us conclude that the body of the planet, like a magnet, approaches and recedes according to the law of the lever along an imaginary diameter of the epicycle tending towards the sun, and that the body's diameter of power, its true diameter DA, tends towards the middle elongations, so that for this time BD tends toward 29\u00b0 Taurus BA towards 29\u00b0 Scorpio.", "5321": "Thus this reciprocational approach is performed without the action of mind, by a magnetic force which, though it inheres in the planet and is independent, nevertheless depends for its definition upon the extrinsic body of the sun.", "5322": "For the force is defined as seeking the sun or fleeing it.", "5323": "And while the force between magnets tending to bring them together ought to be mutual, I have denied, in Chapter 39 above, that the sun has the planets' attracting force: it was instead understood to be purely attractive only, as is clear from the argument presented there ^14.", "5324": "The planets' force, on the other hand, is supposed to be simultaneously attractive on one side and repulsive on the other.", "5325": "Alternatively, one might suppose that the sun, like unmagnetized iron, is only sought after, and does not in turn seek other things.", "5326": "For in the above passage, its filaments were circular, while those of the planets are here supposed to be straight.", "5327": "I am satisfied if this magnetic example demonstrates the general possibility of the proposed mechanism.", "5328": "Concerning its details, however, I have doubts.", "5329": "For when the earth is in question, it is certain that its axis, whose constant  and parallel direction brings about the year's seasons at the cardinal points, is not well suited to bringing about this reciprocation or this aphelion.", "5330": "The sun's apogee, or earth's aphelion, today closely coincides with the solstitial points, and not with the equinoctial, which would fit our theory; nor will it have remained at a constant distance from the cardinal points.", "5331": "And if this axis is unsuitable, it seems that there is none suitable in the earth's entire body, since there is no part of it which rests in the same position while the whole body of the globe revolves in a ceaseless daily whirl about that axis.", "5332": "So indeed, there may be absolutely no material, magnetic faculty that can accomplish the tasks entrusted to the planets individually, since there may be a lack of means, that is, no suitable diameter of the body which remains equidistant to itself as the body is moved around.", "5333": "For this lack has just been made apparent in one of the planets, namely, the globe of the earth.", "5334": "Therefore, let a mind be summoned, which, as was said in Chapter 39, arrives at a knowledge of the distances it traverses by contemplating the growth of the sun's diameter ^15.", "5335": "Let this mind govern a faculty, either animate or natural, that keeps its globe in a parallel position in a manner allowing it to be suitably impelled by the solar power and to reciprocate with respect to the sun.", "5336": "(For a mere mind, unassisted by a faculty of a lower order, could not by itself do anything in a body.16) At the same time care should be taken that the periodic time of the reciprocation not be made exactly equal to the periodic return of the planet, so that the apsides will move.", "5337": "The plausibility of these things is argued in Chapter 39 above ^17.", "5338": "Now that we have obtained from the observations the laws and quantitative characteristics of this reciprocation by which the sun's apparent diameter is varied, matters of which we were still ignorant in Ch.", "5339": "39, it remains for us to see whether those laws may be such that the planets may plausibly know them.", "5340": "The laws of the reciprocation were that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly is the measure of the part of the reciprocation completed.", "5341": "To begin, therefore, I say that admitting as given  the observational evidence, namely, that after equal arcs of the eccentric are traversed, the planet is found at \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6 rather than at \u03b3, \u03b9, \u03bb, \u03b6, the increment of the sun's diameter presents a legitimate measure of the versed sine of the equated anomaly,18 no less so than we know the versed sines of the eccentric anomaly to be a measure of the reciprocation.", "5342": "Now, as was said in Ch.", "5343": "39,19 the planet's mind (if it has such an adjunct) perceives the spaces it traverses in the reciprocation in no other way than by the evidence provided by the increase of the sun's diameter.", "5344": "It will therefore be fitting that it know the versed sine of the equated anomaly, in order that by approaching it might increase the sun's diameter to its prescribed size.", "5345": "The proof is as follows.", "5346": "Let the planet be at \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6 after traversing equal arc of the imperfect eccentric CD, DE, EF, and let the points D and H be joined, the line intersecting the diameter CF at I. Therefore, since the straight lines \u03b4\u03ba\u03b8, \u03b5\u03bc\u03b7 cut the {marginal:", "5347": "277} epicycle into arcs similar to those on the eccentric, by construction, as CF is to CI, so will \u03b3\u03b6 be to \u03b3\u03ba, one section being a measure of the other.", "5348": "These things being so, I say it will also follow that the diameters of the sun at \u03b1, as observed from \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6, will be augmented by the same measure, namely, the measure by which the versed sine of the equated anomaly increases.", "5349": "It would be inconvenient to prove this solidly here.", "5350": "It will, however, easily be understood as holding solidly if we prove it for both ends and the middle.", "5351": "At C the equated anomaly is nothing, and the versed sine is nothing, and the sun, observed from \u03b3, appears at its minimum, so that the amount of its increase is again nothing.", "5352": "At F the equated anomaly is 180\u00b0.", "5353": "The versed sine is equal to the whole diameter, 200,000.", "5354": "And the sun, observed from \u03b6, appears at its maximum, so that it shall have acquired all of its increase.", "5355": "Now for an equated anomaly of 90\u00b0, from A let AM be set up perpendicular to CF, and let MB be joined.", "5356": "Also, from \u03b1 let a line be drawn tangent to the epicycle at \u03bd, and the tangent point \u03bd be joined with the center \u03b2.

E. D. It is therefore certain at both ends and the middle that in this way, if the diameter of the reciprocation is divided by the planet in proportion to the versed sines of the eccentic anomaly, the sun's diameter would increase in  proportion to the versed sines of the equated anomaly.", "5376": "To make it more evident, this is clear in part from the following.", "5377": "Let the straight line BL be drawn from B perpendicular to CF, and about center A, with radius equal to BC, let an arc be drawn intersecting BL at L, and let AL be joined.", "5378": "Since the eccentric anomaly CBL is 90\u00b0, the versed sine will be CB, 100,000, half of the whole diameter, and consequently the reciprocation will be \u03b3\u03b2, half of the whole \u03b3\u03b6.", "5379": "Also, the distance will be \u03b2\u03b1.", "5380": "But AL is equal to it by construction.", "5381": "Thus the planet will be at L.

Concerning the point D there is no problem, since it is the center of its globe.", "5405": "I am not much concerned about K, because, owing to the infinite distance of the fixed stars, BC and DK ultimately coincide at the same  location among the fixed stars, and the fixed stars are real bodies.", "5406": "Therefore there is no absurdity in holding that the planet\u2019s mind uses some hidden sense to keep in view that fixed star which provides lodging for the aphelion at any planet\u2019s mind, because B is not clothed in any body.", "5407": "Furthermore, when one removes the cause for keeping watch on B, the effect is also removed.", "5408": "But B ought to be watched if the circle CD is to be traversed.", "5409": "However, the planets' orbits are not perfectly circular, as was proven from the observations in Chapter 42.", "5410": "Therefore, the planets do not take aim at B. And thus this putative center B is actually secondary to the path CD.", "5411": "But if it were watched by the planet, it would be prior to the path.", "5412": "For these reasons, therefore, I deny that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly provides the planet with a measure of its reciprocation, not because this is not such a measure, but because even if it is, it is not discerned by the planet's mind.", "5413": "But if we suppose it to be the increasing and decreasing of the sun's diameter that serves as the means or aid by which the planet arrives at the correct distances (imperceptible in themselves) in its reciprocations, and then for the variation of this diameter of the sun, from the demonstration just completed, we posit a rule or measure, to be perceived by the planet's mind, [namely,] the equated anomaly of the eccentric, DAC, or rather, KDA, in the diagram,  we now stand closer to the truth.", "5414": "For both measures are perceptible: for the reciprocation, the increasing and decreasing magnitude of the sun's diameter, and for the measure, or angle, three points clothed in bodies.", "5415": "For at A there is the sun itself, at D the planet, and at K the fixed star that indicates the aphelia.", "5416": "Perhaps it ought therefore to be said (as indeed we also just embraced above in Ch.", "5417": "39, when we supposed that the forces of Nature were insufficient to administer the celestial motions) that there is attributed to the planet an ability to sense the light of the fixed stars and the sun, the confluence of whose radiations at the center of the planetary body gives an estimate of this angle of equated anomaly ^20.", "5418": "There is but one difficulty to clear up.", "5419": "For what reason is it not the angle itself  that is made to be the measure of the planetary operation (that is, to make the sun's diameter increase by approaching the sun), but the versed sine in place of the angle?", "5420": "*21  And by what means might the planet perceive the sine of the equated anomaly?", "5421": "Does it proceed in the way humans do, by geometrical reasoning?", "5422": "Nevertheless, hitherto no faculty of administering the celestial motions belongs to the planet's mind that could not have been acquired by a divine inspiration imparted at the very beginning of the world and lasting even to this day, without any reasoning whatever.", "5423": "Therefore, what was said just above should be repeated, namely that the sine of the equated anomaly is the index of the strength of the angles KDA: on this point, see Aristotle's Mechanics,22 and what was said above in this chapter.", "5424": "For when the two balance arms are disposed at an obtuse angle, they are more easily directed than when they are at a right angle, the ease of direction being proportional to the sines.", "5425": "And, on the other hand, when the two arms are connected at an acute angle, they are more easily made to move together into a single line, head-to-head, than if they were connected at a right angle.", "5426": "Refer again to the demonstration contained in what was just presented.", "5427": "Thus, in one way, if it makes sense for the planet to have a sense of the strength of the  angles, there will be no absurdity in our saying (using our human conception) that the sines of the angles are known to it.", "5428": "But why would it take note of the natural strength of the angles?", "5429": "(We are evidently returning to natural principles).", "5430": "As before, let there be certain regions of the planetary body in which there is a magnetic force of direction along a line tending towards the sun.", "5431": "However, contrary to the previous case, let it be an attribute, not of the nature of the body, but of an animate faculty of the sort that governs the body of the planet from within, that as it is swept along by the sun, it keeps that  magnetic axis always directed at the same fixed stars, except to the extent that it turns the axis a little over the ages.", "5432": "The result will be a battle between the animate faculty and the magnetic faculty, and the animate will win.", "5433": "It is no different from what we had said in Ch.", "5434": "34, that the bodies of the planets naturally seek rest, but are moved by the extrinsic force of the sun.", "5435": "Alternatively, here is a more apt example.", "5436": "The weight of the human arm naturally tends towards the center of the earth.", "5437": "However, in a flag bearer the animate faculty takes over and makes the weight extend over his head and wave in a circulatory motion.", "5438": "Here the animate faculty overcomes the natural weight, and would do so forever if the body of the flag-bearer together with all its faculties had not been created mortal.", "5439": "On the basis of these presuppositions, the planet's mind will be able to intuit and perceive the strength of the angle from the wrestling match between the animate faculty, which is designed to keep the magnetic axis in line, and the magnetic power of directing it towards the sun.", "5440": "This arrangement seems also to be confirmed by the example of the moon, which is incontestably more strongly propelled when it is on the diametral line of the sun and the earth, perhaps because of this strength of the angles.", "5441": "The final conclusion, then, will be this.", "5442": "A planet situated at aphelion makes no endeavor in the direction of the sun, but is carried along in proportion to the distance AC.", "5443": "The angle KDA results from its forward motion.", "5444": "In accord with the proportion of strength of this angle, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase by approaching the sun.", "5445": "In its approach, it diminishes the distance, making it AD.", "5446": "Since the distance is diminished, the forward motion is increased.", "5447": "Therefore, the angle KDA is changed more rapidly.", "5448": "Therefore, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase more rapidly (other things being equal).", "5449": "Thus is established a perpetual circulation which does not occur by leaps such as we have supposed in our thinking and calculation, ignoring imperceptible errors, but is quite continuous.", "5450": "What I have said so far holds conditionally, if the reciprocation supported by the observations cannot be performed by some magnetic power, implanted in the bodies of the planets, and if it has become absolutely necessary for us to have recourse to a mind.", "5451": "Otherwise, if a comparison between the natural motion and the mental one is in order, the former stands on its own, requiring nothing external, while the latter, the mental motion, appears to give evidence of the magnetic one, and to require its assistance, no matter how you equip it with an animate faculty of moving the body.", "5452": "For in the first place, mind by itself can do nothing to a body.", "5453": "It is therefore necessary to provide for the mind an adjunct faculty that performs its functions in making the planet's body reciprocate.", "5454": "This faculty will be either animate or natural and magnetic.", "5455": "It cannot be animate, for an animate faculty cannot transport its body from place to place (as this reciprocation requires) without the power of another assisting body.", "5456": "Therefore, it will be a magnetic, that is, natural, faculty of sympathy between the bodies of the planet and the sun.", "5457": "Thus the mind calls upon nature and the magnets for assistance.", "5458": "Second, at the halfway point in its pattern, which is the equated anomaly, it has traversed a greater part \u03b3\u03bf of its reciprocation above, and a smaller part \u03bf\u03b6 below, while completing half of its task, which consists of increasing or decreasing the sun's diameter.", "5459": "Nor do \u03b3\u03bf, \u03bf\u03b6 correspond to parts of the time.", "5460": "For more time is consumed on \u03b3\u03bf than its excess over \u03bf\u03b6 required.", "5461": "Nor do the parts increase continuously from \u03b6 to \u03b3, the ones about \u03b3, \u03ba being smaller, as well as those about \u03bc, \u03b6. The operations of mind, however, are accustomed to being constant.", "5462": "There was consequently a need for us to equip the mind with an animate faculty, as well as a magnetic one, and to contrive a battle between the two which would remind the mind of its duties, of which it could not have been reminded by the equality of either the times or the spaces traversed.", "5463": "So again we have asked nature to assist the mind.", "5464": "On the other hand, all these modifications really appertain to the workings of the sun's extrinsic magnetic power, and of the magnetic [power] joined to it, which inheres in the planet, as was explained above.", "5465": "If, therefore, the magnetic powers can do the job on their own, what need have they of the directing function of mind?", "5466": "Although we have remained uncertain about the magnetic force inherent in the planetary bodies, through our consideration of the earth's axis, which is different from the sun's line of apsides, this difficulty is common to both explanations.", "5467": "For even when we supposed a mind, we were compelled to admit the kind of axis that we wanted in the earth, through whose mediation the mind could apprehend the strength of the angle, or its versed sine.", "5468": "On the contrary, probability strongly urges us to ascribe this reciprocation of the planets, which without doubt is in accord with the laws of nature, entirely to nature, whatever may be the means by which it occupies the planet's bodies.", "5469": "Moreover, I do not know whether I have given sufficient proof to the philosophical reader of this perceptual cognition of the sun and the fixed stars, which I myself so easily accept, and bestow upon the planet's mind.", "5470": "Furthermore, in those very modes of operation which we have prescribed to the mind, the soundest of all those which were deemed possible appear to involve some geometrical uncertainty.", "5471": "I am not sure whether this might not be repudiated by God Himself, as to this point He has always been seen to proceed by the path of demonstration.", "5472": "For if a planet, insofar as it may have approached the sun partly by its inherent force, comes into one and another degree of extrinsic power from the sun (as it does indeed come); and if the different degrees also reciprocally intensify the planet's own force of approaching while they increase the angle, which is posited as the standard of measure23 of the approach, or of the increase of the sun's diameter; then the planet's own striving finally becomes in part its own measure, and simultaneously prior and posterior in the intensification of the planet['s force].", "5473": "For in its parts it is unequal, and for this reason it requires a measure.", "5474": "Thus, the search for the forces tempering both powers will be concluded by a kind of iterative method24 rather than deductively, so that they may complete their cycles in the same time, and in the same revolution of the body.", "5475": "Someone might, however, want to think he had found the cause of the  progression of the aphelia in the ungeometrical25 nature of this measure.", "5476": "But in Ch.", "5477": "35 we left it undecided whether this category of motion might not  exist through another cause, namely, occultation ^26.", "5478": "That is, just as a plate of iron intercepts the force of a magnet on a strip of iron, the bodies of the planets might also mutually intercept the magnetic powers proper to them, by which they incline towards the sun.", "5479": "And so that this might not happen to the solar power\u2014so that, I mean, the solar power, common to all, could not be intercepted for one planet by the interposition of another\u2014we have drawn a distinction between the essence of the solar body and that of the planets' bodies.", "5480": "So, since we have not drawn a distinction between the bodies of the planets themselves, this seems still to be a possible cause.", "5481": "It could, of course, not have been arranged thus unless the exact magnetic disposition of the planet's body, by which the reciprocation is administered, were known.", "5482": "But to give an example of reasoning: let the planet have a magnetic disposition of the sort which, though we had introduced it somewhat earlier, we later denied the earth to possess.", "5483": "In this disposition, impediment through occultation does not have any place.", "5484": "For because it was the effect of the magnetic power to tend towards the sun and to recede from the sun, meanwhile keeping the fibers of its magnetic seat in line, if another planet, coming between the sun and the planet, impedes this travel towards the sun, or recession from it, while not impeding the common motion from the sun, the planet will approach or recede less than it should, and thus the size of the circuit will be altered along with the periodic time, over the ages, and will again be corrected by contrary eclipses.", "5485": "However, the aphelion will not change position through this occultation.", "5486": "So the cause for the motion of the aphelia previously proposed by us still reigns alone, without peer or rival.", "5487": "Further, if a mind should preside over the reciprocation in the manner described, occultation will still do no harm.", "5488": "For as was said, the mind would use the angle of equated anomaly as its measure for increasing the sun's diameter; and, while deprived of the perception of it for a slight amount of time (that is, while the sun is hidden), it would be possible (the gods willing) to compensate for what the mind would have missed, upon the sun's re-emerging and restoring the equated anomaly into view.", "5489": "For mind (where there is one) is master of the animate faculty, and uses it differently and unequally according to circumstances.", "5490": "So why should it not use the animate faculty in an unusual manner here too, in removing the discrepancy between the measure (the equated anomaly) and the measured quantity (the sun's diameter) which had insinuated itself through the means of the sun's eclipse?", "5491": "What about other slow motions of this kind, such as the precession of the equinoxes arising from the earth's axis being directed at one or another of the fixed stars, and not at the sun?", "5492": "For here, the removal of the sun's light can have no effect, since its presence has no effect either.", "5493": "We would like to avoid the inconvenient effects of magnetic occultations  upon the reciprocations proper to the planets, just as we did in Ch.", "5494": "35 for the common revolving effect of the sun.", "5495": "It should therefore be said that the bodies of the planets can indeed be similar in their magnetic dispositions, but either (1) they are so far from one another that the planets' orbs of power would not overlap, or (2) the power coming from the sun is so strong (that which activates the planets' proper powers no less than that which makes them revolve in their orbs) that it could not be impeded at all by the interposition of a small, weak body, so that it would pass on through, just as light passes through a globe  of water, or (3) the bodies of the planets are so meager that they would have no effect, nor is the sun ever substantially blocked by any planet for any of the other planets moved by the sun, as the sun is never substantially blocked from the earth by the moon.", "5496": "For although the whole sun can be covered for the moon for several hours, the moon performs its reciprocation with respect to the earth, not the sun, and it can never be deprived of its perception of the earth since there is no body between the earth and the moon.", "5497": "Nevertheless, it might appear plausible to someone that the transposition  of the apogees is instantaneous, and occurs through the cause of the sun's being eclipsed.", "5498": "Let him say, if he please, that to prevent the reciprocation's undergoing a sudden leap of speed when it is interrupted by an eclipse, during which the planet is moved by the sun to another angle and another degree of its strength, this angular leap is compensated by the planet itself, by having its axis incline towards the sun at the same angle after the eclipse as it was at the beginning of the eclipse.", "5499": "For thus a transposition of the aphelia will be obtained, but one occurring by leaps, and remaining in the same sidereal position for many years, until there happens to be another occultation of the planet.", "5500": "On the other hand, the prior cause of the transposition of the aphelia,  arising from the reciprocation's aberration from its sidereal circuit, produced by the ungeometrical27 interconnection of its components, favors the uniform transposition of the apogees.", "5501": "Finally, if neither of these causes obtains, let the mind, furnished with an  animate faculty which presides over the constant direction of the magnetic axis, have the additional task of inclining the axis over the ages.", "5502": "But if none of these causes stands, nor even the general idea of a mind, let us be satisfied with nature, which, as she has allowed everything else to be disentangled, has also shown a splendid occasion for the motion of the aphelia.", "5503":

Furthermore, it was proved in Ch.", "5998": "13 above, using an ingenious treatment of the observations, that the declinations of all the points of the circuit from the plane of the ecliptic are arranged by the same measure.", "5999": "So no instance can be urged against our hypothesis.", "6000": "But there are still two difficult questions to be answered.", "6001": "One concerns how this declination of the axis originates, and the other concerns the axis itself.", "6002": "First, is the inclination of the axis natural or rational, the work of the body's nature or of an angel?", "6003": "And second, are the axis of inclination and the magnetic axis that seeks the sun the same?", "6004": "And if they are different, how do they exist in the same globular planetary body?", "6005": "The two questions are interrelated.", "6006": "I might almost have believed it to be natural, owing to the similarity between the natural power in the magnet and this one, were it not for the successive transposition of the nodes that had also been added, which clearly seems the work of a reasoning faculty, if not discursive, at least instinctual.", "6007": "For to maintain its equidistant position is less marvelous and more in accord with nature than previously in the matter of the eccentricity.", "6008": "There, we said that it is the sun that is sought by the axis of power, while here, it is the position beneath the far distant fixed stars.", "6009": "There, the axis was to have been turned about by the force of this magnetic power as the body is carried around, and would not remain equidistant to itself, if it were not restrained by a stronger directional force, or by an animate force, either unassisted or capable of reasoning in some manner.", "6010": "Here, the axis follows these equidistant positions by the force of our directional power itself, with no need of an animate power or of reasoning.", "6011": "Someone might, however, consider it the act of a mind, that the diameter that effects the latitude points directly towards the center of the sun when the planet is located at the limits, thus making a great circle of the  planet's orbit, and causing the nodes to be at opposite positions with respect to the sun.", "6012": "To this argument, in Ch.", "6013": "39 above, I affirmed that the planet moves with respect to the sun.", "6014": "However, it is not just any kind of relationship with the sun that argues for the assistance of reason.", "6015": "It is of course true that he who first ordained the heavenly motions so directed this axis as to point at the sun when at the appointed position, and did so deliberately and with perfect rationality.", "6016": "But this relationship with the sun can now be maintained without a mind, by the constancy of the magnetic faculty alone.", "6017": "For it is more like rest than motion, and hence is material, not mental.", "6018": "Therefore, it is only the variation of this inclination which we call the translation of the nodes over the ages that still makes a case for a motive force that is more than natural, or physical, as are magnetic powers.", "6019": "Nevertheless, I would prefer to think that the two must be conjoined, rather than to suppose that the rational faculty acts alone.", "6020": "Let the magnetic faculty be subordinate; let the rational be in charge, ruling over it, just as we said before in Chapter 57 concerning the power of seeking the sun.", "6021": "Once this question is settled, there follows the other.", "6022": "If this directive power arises from magnetic, physical, natural [powers], its substrate will be a body.", "6023": "Could it therefore happen that the same diameter that seeks the sun or flees from it also governs the planet's deviation from the ecliptic, by being inclined to it?", "6024": "If the nodes were connected to the apsides and the limits to the middle elongations then the diameter would be the same in all respects, administering both the eccentricity and the latitude.", "6025": "For it was said in Ch.", "6026": "57 that the diameter that causes the eccentricity is directed towards the middle elongations, while it was just now said that the diameter that causes the latitude is directed towards the limits.", "6027": "Therefore, if the limits were connected to the middle elongations, both diameters would have the same direction, and, their positions thus being in agreement, nothing would prevent their being identical.", "6028": "However, the nodes, or intersections with the true ecliptic, do not coincide with the apsides.", "6029": "For Mars, the northern limit is 12 degrees before the aphelion, for Jupiter, the northern limit and the aphelion coincide exactly, for Saturn, the node follows the aphelion by 24 degrees, and for the moon, owing to its short orbit, everything becomes interchanged with everything else.", "6030": "For now the node is at apogee, now at the middle elongations, now at perihelion [sic].", "6031": "So since these two powers differ in time and position, it follows that they are not identical.", "6032": "There is, however, nothing to impede their residing in one and the same planetary body as a whole, except the motion or rotation of the globe.", "6033": "Thus if the planets are moved like the moon, which does not rotate, but always shows us the same face, nothing prevents our saying that the two are interwoven, as  the weft is interwoven with the warp.", "6034": "For since the entire body of the planet would then stay in the same sidereal position as it is carried about the sun, any of its rectilinear parts, among which are numbered those two diameters, will stay in the same sidereal position.", "6035": "If, on the other hand, it is the earth's globe that is in question, which has a daily rotation in addition to its annual revolution, we are left in great doubt, no less than before, in Ch.", "6036": "57.", "6037": "For if the body rotates, only one single diameter of power, that which is parallel to the axis of its rotational motion, remains constant and equidistant from itself.", "6038": "So if you were to say that in addition to that diameter, there is interwoven with it another altogether different one, a power of another sort, which causes the latitude, it will observe the same direction as the axis of rotation, since it circumscribes a cone about that axis, successively traversing each of its parts, and since it inclines, now to the right, now to the left side, it finally leads the body towards the middle position, whither the axis of rotation points.", "6039": "Therefore, if the globe rotates, the subject of this declinational power is either not a body but something spiritual, or is not the same body.", "6040": "If it is something spiritual, how does it look to certain regions of the world, which are corporeal?", "6041": "And how does it impart this kind of motion (declination from the royal road) to the body?", "6042": "Is it perhaps that the body is more easily inclined, and departs from the royal road more easily (meanwhile receiving the cause of its translational motion extrinsically, from the sun), than it is carried from place to place by the force of its own proper mover?", "6043": "If, on the other hand, we prefer a corporeal subject, some mechanism will be brought into being for us, like those spherical oil lamps which, though thrown and spun around, do not spill any oil.", "6044": "For within is enclosed a little flask which, being drawn down by a weight in its belly,3 and held there, does not follow the convoluted motion of the surrounding sphere.", "6045": "Is there then also some interior globe within this globe of the earth, to which the diurnal motion of the earth's exterior does not penetrate, but which is held in place by a very strong inclination towards certain sidereal positions, so as not to follow the revolving exterior of the body?", "6046": "For as we shall see in Chapter 68, this question pertains to the earth as well.", "6047": "We shall also see there whether, if some mean ecliptic be proposed for the six planets, that which we were requiring a little earlier can be accomplished, namely, that the nodes of each of the planets correspond to the apsides.", "6048": "Or is it rather to be believed that there are some possible modes of celestial motion which, though physical like the magnetic [powers], cannot be comprehended by anyone on earth owing to the lack of examples?", "6049": "For if we had lacked the example of the magnet (which was indeed unknown at one time), we would have been ignorant of most of the causes of the celestial motions.", "6050": "Those who believe in solid orbs can easily set everything right, following what was said in Ch.", "6051": "13.", "6052": "For they will attribute to the plane of Mars's eccentric FE an inclination to the plane of the ecliptic DC that does not librate, but is fixed and constant, above the diameter BA of intersection of these planes, drawn through the center of the world (the center of the sun, for Brahe), and they will say that over the ages it rotates about the center A beneath the ecliptic DC.", "6053": "And since the poles (F, G and B, C in the present diagram) of two great", "6054": "circles (ML and KH) are distant by an amount equal to their maximum declination MK, LH, the poles of Mars B, C will therefore describe small circles about the poles of the ecliptic F, G, with radius FB, GC, of 1\u00b0 50' 25\".", "6055": "These people will also say that the poles of the Martian sphere B, C revolve forward with a motion quantitatively the same as that which was expressed above in Ch.", "6056": "17, and which will be corrected below in ch 69.", "6057": "Chapter 64", "6058": "Examination of the parallax of Mars through the latitudes.", "6059": "In Chapter 61, the two nodes were found to be at positions exactly opposed, a marvelous agreement and one which excludes all parallax.", "6060": "Let it be the case that Mars's parallax is at least 1' and 2' [respectively] when at opposition to the sun (and nearer to the earth than the sun) in 1595 and 1589, and that on the former date Mars was about 38\u00b0 from the zenith, and on the latter about 66\u00b0.", "6061": "Accordingly, in 1589, when it was thought to be at the node, it would still have been nearly 2' to the north.", "6062": "Therefore, it would still have been one degree before the node.", "6063": "So the node would be, not 16\u00b0 46' Scorpio, but 17\u00b0 46' Scorpio.", "6064": "In 1595, on the other hand, it would have 1' of parallax.", "6065": "Therefore, on the day on which it was thought to be at the ascending node, it would now actually have had a latitude of 1', and it would thus now have been about 30' beyond the node.", "6066": "Therefore, the ascending node would be, not at 16\u00b0 46' Taurus, but at 16\u00b0 16' Taurus.", "6067": "You see that the descending node is at 17\u00be\u00b0 Scorpio, and the ascending at 16\u00bc\u00b0 Taurus, if you make use even of the least parallax.", "6068": "Let us therefore conclude, as in Ch.", "6069": "11, that Mars's diurnal parallax is entirely imperceptible, if it is indeed true that the two observations of latitude are correct within 2'.", "6070": "Another argument for no parallax, which is not dissimilar, will arise for us out of Ch.", "6071": "62, premised upon the investigation of the inclination of the planes, perfectly true unless refraction will throw something off.", "6072": "Let it be the case that in 1593, at an altitude of 22\u00b0, Mars had a parallax of at least 2', while in 1585, at an altitude of 53\u00b0, it had a parallax of one minute.", "6073": "The observed southern latitude would therefore be smaller then the northern, and so the inclination would also be smaller.", "6074": "But now, just above, without parallax, it appears somewhat smaller, by an amount attributable to a small error in observation or to a certain amount of refraction at an altitude of 23\u00b0.", "6075": "Therefore, when parallax is considered, the observation would be charged with a greater error, and conversely, if the observation stands, the parallax is entirely eliminated, if it is indeed true that the orbit of Mars is contained in a perfect plane that intersects the plane of the ecliptic at the very center of the sun.", "6076": "But the same is proved much more certainly from the latitudes observed at  other acronychal positions, especially those which the circumstances of observation or refraction did not render dubious.", "6077": "As I began to say in Ch.", "6078": "15, this matter has so far been impossible to settle ^1.", "6079": "For in 1587, when Mars was 55 degrees from the zenith, if it had had a parallax of 4' its latitude of 3\u00b0 37' would have been increased to 3\u00b0 41'.", "6080": "But in Chapter 62, it was found to be no greater than 3\u00b0 37' ^2.", "6081": "And in 1589, when the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, if Mars's parallax had been 5\u00bd (judging from the sun's horizontal parallax of 3'), then the northern latitude, instead of the observed 1\u00b0 7', would have been 1\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 freed of parallax ^3.", "6082": "But we have computed no more than 1\u00b0 5\u2153\u2018, although a slight error of 2' could have occurred in the observation, such as if Mars at an altitude of 22\u00b0, still subject to refraction, had appeared 2' higher (to the north) than was correct, as was said in both Ch.", "6083": "62 and Ch.", "6084": "15 ^4.", "6085": "And in 1602, when with a parallax correction the observed latitude was found to be 4\u00b0 10', and without the correction, 4\u00b0 7\u00bd\u2019, we computed 4\u00b0 7 \u2156\u2019, very precisely ^5.", "6086": "Similarly in 1604 we did not agree perfectly with the observed quantity of northern latitude ^6.", "6087": "Therefore, we shall complain that it is much less when it is increased through the removal of parallax.", "6088": "By these three procedures, we have overcome our uncertainty about Mars's parallax.", "6089": "However, we have not completely proved that it is utterly imperceptible, since the matter of refraction eludes us, and besides, the observations do not descend to within 2 or 3 minutes.", "6090": "So if anyone wishes to attribute to Mars a maximum latitudinal parallax of 2 or 2\u00bd minutes, these Brahean observations do not significantly disagree with him.", "6091": "For the inclination, too, will be accommodated to this view, becoming 1\u00b0 51' 0\".", "6092": "Chapter 65", "6093": "Investigation of the maximum latitude in both regions: in conjunction as well as opposition with the sun.", "6094": "Once the inclination is established, it is easy to define the maximum latitude, and this can be done in two ways.", "6095": "For one can find the maximum for all time, or how great it could be in our time.", "6096": "Today the two hardly differ, since the limits are the midpoints between the apsides of Mars and of the sun or earth, and they are no more than 54 degrees from one another, and the eccentricity of the sun or earth is not great.", "6097": "Nonetheless, let it be the case (as it once was) that the apsides of Mars and the sun coincide, along with the limits of Mars's latitudes.", "6098": "And let the ecliptic maintain its sidereal position.", "6099": "Now since, in the diagram of Ch.", "6100": "13, Mars's greatest distance AC is 166,465, the sun's least distance AB is 98,200, and BAC is 1\u00b0

101,800, this is decreased to 1\u00b0 8' 34\".", "6102": "But the southern latitude, from Mars's distance of 138,234, and the sun's of 101,800, is computed to be 6\u00b0 58' 24\", a little less than 7\u00b0.", "6103": "At conjunction with the sun, when the sun's distance is 98,200, this is decreased to 1\u00b0 4' 36\".", "6104": "If, however, one considers the contrary case, in which the sun's apogee coincides with Mars's perihelion, the maximum northern latitude at opposition comes out to be 4\u00b0 44' 12\", and at conjunction 1\u00b0 9' 32\", while the southern latitude at opposition is 6\u00b0 20' 50\", and at conjunction 1\u00b0 3' 32\".", "6105": "And this is how it would be if the apsides and the limits were to coincide at some time, but whether this is going to happen before the whole fabric comes to ruin is uncertain.", "6106": "It is certain that Ptolemy attributed equal motions to the apsides and nodes, and if this were so, that conjunction would never happen.", "6107": "But even though today they appear to undergo different motions, the observations of the ancients are not sufficiently reliable, and the difference of these motions even in modern astronomy is not sufficiently great, for us to conclude how many myriads of years apart these conjunctions of the apsides and the limits occur.", "6108": "Therefore, let us return to our era, that which extends between us and Ptolemy.", "6109": "And here, one who is looking for geometrically precise determinations is presented with a manifold obstacle to computation ^1.", "6110": "First, the apsides of the sun and Mars are not in conjunction, and second, the planets' orbits are not perfect circles.", "6111": "So even if we project a new line of apsides through the centers of the circles of Mars and the earth (through B, C in the diagram of Chapter 52), it will still be possible for the nearest approach of the celestial bodies to occur elsewhere than on this line.", "6112": "Finally, even if the position of the nearest approach were established, the position of the northern and southern limit is different.", "6113": "For example, the limit is at 16\u00b0 50' Leo.", "6114": "But the straight line BC projected through the centers of the circles is directed towards 24\u00bd Leo and Aquarius, approximately; in the same direction, that is, in which Brahe put his line of apsides HF, to which our line BC runs parallel, both eccentricities being bisected, AF at C, and AH at B.", "6115": "And I was now about to choose the mean between 17\u00b0 Leo and 25\u00b0 Leo, namely, 21\u00b0 Leo, but the year 1585 gave me pause, since in that year the latitude observed at 21\u00b0 36' Leo was clearly not a maximum.", "6116": "For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4\u00b0 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4\u00b0 31'.", "6117": "It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4\u00b0 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.", "6118": "Therefore, let the maximum latitude occur about 19\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius, where Mars was on January 24.", "6119": "And since the supplement of the equated anomaly was 10\u00b0, the distance of Mars will be 166,200, and of the sun,

is worthy of consideration that on about the tenth day of August Mars had its maximum southern latitude, and that it decreased afterwards, so that at opposition on the 24th it was about one fourth of

derived there.", "6129": "The cause of this needs to be looked into carefully.\"", "6130": "When I later had come to him in Bohemia, and frequently inquired about how the latitudes are arranged, he answered that the nodes are at opposite positions, and the line of intersection passes through the point of the sun's mean position, or through the center of its epicycle (for which see Ch.", "6131":

in this fifth part; however, you would have almost as much trouble finding the boundaries of the maximum latitudes geometrically, as Apollonius of Perga had in finding the boundaries of the stations.", "6135": "For in the business of the stations, a certain condition can be described  through which the position of the stations may be known (and that condition is this, that the line of vision of Mars, the earth being in motion, remains parallel to itself).", "6136": "But the position of the stations cannot be demonstrated a priori from this condition without multiple calculations, owing to the confluence of many causes.", "6137": "And matters stand just the same with the maximum latitude for any given occurrence.", "6138": "For the latitude is greatest when the distance of  Mars from the earth is increasing or decreasing in the same ratio in which the lines of Mars's inclinations increase or decrease.", "6139": "And the latitude is increasing when the ratio of the distance decreases more than the ratio of the lines of inclination, or when the former is decreasing while the latter, on the contrary, is increasing.", "6140": "And, in turn, the latitude is decreasing either when the distance of Mars from the earth increases more than the lines of inclination, each in its own proportion, or when the distance is increasing while the lines are decreasing.", "6141": "These conditions are satisfied indiscriminately, now at opposition, now before, now after, depending on whether the opposition falls at the limit, or before, or after the limit.", "6142": "That these results follow from the hypothesis of this work, my ephemerides prove ^3.", "6143": "In 1604, about Feb.", "6144": "25 or March 6, the northern latitude was a maximum,

"The reason why these things would appear remarkable in ancient astronomy is chiefly that Ptolemy and his imitators had fabricated the extremely intricate motions of inclination, deviation and reflection ^6.", "6151": "For since Ptolemy clung to his invention of the epicycle, as soon as he saw that when the planet was at opposition to the sun (and was thus visible) the epicycle went out to one side, he immediately indulged in conjecture, asserting that at conjunction with the sun, when it is not visible, the epicycle goes out in the other direction, and generally, that at conjunction the epicycle does the opposite of what he observed it to do at opposition.", "6152": "This is done in order that there be some compensation and equality of return and coherence with the sun.", "6153": "However, this is not discovering the true by observing, but fabricating the observations by a falsely conceived fancy.", "6154": "Nevertheless, it should be condoned in him, since he had few observations.", "6155": "On this subject, see Ch.", "6156": "14 also ^7.", "6157": "But come, let us see whether our calculation gives the observed latitude on August 10.", "6158": "For we are sure of July 21 and August 25 of that year, since the calculation yields the observations upon which it is based ^8.", "6159": "So, on August 10 at 13h 45m, Mars's eccentric position on the ecliptic is computed to be 2\u00b0 41' 18\" Pisces, the sun was 27\u00b0 37' 49\" Leo, the angle at the sun 5\u00b0 3' 29\", the angle at the earth 18\u00b0 25', and from the calculation Mars was at 16\u00b0 3' Pisces, while it was observed at 16\u00b0 7' Pisces ^9.", "6160": "And since 2\u00b0 40\u2019 48\" Pisces, the position on the orbit, is distant from 16\u00b0 43' Taurus10 by 74\u00b0 2', the inclination will therefore be 1\u00b0 46' 10\".", "6161": "From this and the two angles mentioned, using the method given in Ch.", "6162": "62, the observed latitude is found to be 6\u00b0 21' 14\", still two minutes more than the observation has.", "6163": "But lest the angle's small magnitude trip us up, let us use the true distances of Mars from the earth and the sun (as the method given above requires), or in their place, the true angles.", "6164": "In the diagram of Chapter 20 you see that CB, BA differ from CL, LA.", "6165": "And our method did not say that the sine of the angle LAB is to the sine of the angle LCB as CB is to BA, but as CL is to LA.", "6166": "Let the ecliptic position be 2\u00b0 41' 18\" Pisces, Mars standing beneath the point \u03bb, and \u03ba be the position opposite the sun, 27\u00b0 37' 49\" Aquarius.", "6167": "Therefore, \u03ba\u03b2 is 5\u00b0 3' 29\", and \u03b2\u03bb is 1\u00b0 46' 10\".", "6168": "From this and the right angle \u03bb\u03b2\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bb or CAL is given as 5\u00b0 21' 36\", to which corresponds the true distance of Mars L from the sun A ^11.", "6169": "So in triangle CAL, from the sides CA, 101,077, and AL, 138,261, and from the angle just found, let LCA be sought, which is found to be 160\u00b0 33'.", "6170": "Its supplement is 19\u00b0 27', to which corresponds the true distance of Mars L from the earth C.", "6171": "So now, using these angles of the operation, I find the apparent latitude LCB to be 6\u00b0 19' 10\", very nearly the same as the observed value ^12.", "6172": "Thus the hypothesis established in this work shows this very thing whose cause Brahe advised was diligently to be sought, and which ancient astronomy, for all its apparatus, cannot show.", "6173": "And, I would add, it shows this in all its simplicity, in that the plane of the eccentric is given a constant inclination or obliquity, and this is variously increased or diminished, not in reality, but optically only, insofar as our sighting approaches it or recedes from it, or (for Brahe and Ptolemy) it approaches or recedes from our sighting.", "6174": "Chapter 67", "6175": "From the positions of the nodes and the inclination of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic, it is demonstrated that the eccentricity of Mars takes its origin, not from the point of the sun's mean position (or, for Brahe, the center of the sun's epicycle), but from the very center of the sun.", "6176": "The end is a reply to the beginning.", "6177": "In Chapter 6, I argued on physical grounds that when solid orbs are denied, the eccentricities of the planets cannot take their origin from any point other than the very center of the sun.", "6178": "I postponed part of the geometrical proof of this, based upon the observations, to Chapters 22, 23, and 52, in which places I think I have satisfied even the sharpest- eyed critic.", "6179": "The other part I shall now expound.", "6180": "This is done first through the positions of the nodes.", "6181": "It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun.", "6182": "The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed?", "6183": "Not at all.", "6184": "Consider again the Copernican diagram in Chapter 6 ^1.", "6185": "In it let \u03ba\u03b4 now be the line of the limits, at 16\u00be\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius (not, as in Ch.", "6186": "6, the line of apsides at 29\u00b0 Leo).", "6187": "Therefore, the line [NN'] drawn through \u03ba perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 will be the diameter of the nodes.", "6188": "But if we use the mean sun instead of the apparent sun, then we are given \u03b2 instead of \u03ba as the point from which the eccentricity is reckoned.", "6189": "So from \u03b2 let \u03b2\u03c2 be drawn perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 [and extended to PP'].", "6190": "This will fall at positions exactly opposite about \u03b2, but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through \u03ba, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above \u03b2\u03c2 by the distance \u03ba\u03c2.", "6191": "It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point \u03ba is connected to the points of intersection of the line \u03b2\u03c2 with the circumference of the eccentric.", "6192": "Since, by supposition, \u03c2\u03ba is at 16\u00b0 45' Leo, and \u03b2\u03ba is at about 5\u00b0 45' Cancer, the angle \u03b2\u03ba\u03c2 will be 41\u00b0; and since \u03b2\u03c2\u03ba is right, \u03ba\u03b2\u03c2 will be 49\u00b0.", "6193": "And since \u03ba\u03b2 is the sun's eccentricity, 3600, where the orb of the earth or the sun is 100,000, therefore, as the whole sine of the angle \u03c2 is to \u03b2\u03ba, 3600, so is the sine of angle \u03b2 to \u03ba\u03c2, 2717.", "6194": "And in the same units (where the semidiameter of the earth\u2019s orb is 100,000), the semidiameter of Mars's orb, from Ch.", "6195": "54, is 152,350.", "6196": "Therefore, where the semidiameter of Mars's orb is 100,000, \u03ba\u03c2 will be 1790, showing an angle of 1\u00b0 1' 33\" in the [table of] sines.", "6197": "The ascending node [P'] should therefore have been moved backward, and the descending node [P] moved forward, by that number of degrees, minutes, and seconds, if I had been mistaken in taking the sun's center \u03ba instead of the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Brahean point \u03b2. But in turn, where the observations are referred to the mean sun, and thus the point \u03b2 is taken, if this is done in error, and \u03ba should have been chosen instead, the ascending node [\u039d'] found from \u03b2 should be in a place farther forward, and the descending node [N] farther back, so as to shorten the northern semicircle [N\u2019\u03b7N] by an arc of 2\u00b0 3' 6\".", "6198": "Let us see whether it happens in this way.", "6199": "In the observations of Chapter 12, considered approximately, on 1595 October 28 Mars was considered to have been at the node ^2.", "6200": "From the Brahean equations, which rely on the point \u03b2, its eccentric position was found to be 16\u00b0 48' Taurus.", "6201": "And on the morning of 1589 May 9 we supposed Mars to have been at the other, descending, node ^3.", "6202": "Using the same Brahean equations, we computed Mars's eccentric position to be 15\u00b0 44\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio at that time.", "6203": "So what I said should happen, does happen: there are 1 degree and 3\u00bd minutes less in the northern semicircle.", "6204": "If the observations are treated more accurately, as in Ch.", "6205": "61, Mars arrives at the ascending node one day and 15 hours late.", "6206": "Therefore, about 50 minutes are added to the eccentric position, so that the planet falls at 17\u00b0 38' Taurus, in its eccentric motion.", "6207": "Accordingly, the abbreviation of the upper semicircle is 1\u00b0 53\u00bd\u2019, virtually equal to the computed value of 2\u00b0 3'.", "6208": "Therefore, the point \u03ba is entirely confirmed, and \u03b2 is rejected.", "6209": "For why will the diameter of the intersection of the planes not intersect the diameter of the apsides in the center from which the eccentricity originates, as above?", "6210": "What would be the cause of such a thing?", "6211": "The same is also demonstrated through the inclination of the planes demonstrated in Ch.", "6212": "62, using the diagram of Chapter 20.", "6213": "The inclination, that is, the angle LAB under which the digression of the northern limit appears when seen from the sun A, was there found to be 1\u00b0 50' 45\".", "6214": "But the angle MAD, under which the southern limit's digression from the ecliptic appears when viewed from the sun A, was found to be nearly equal to it, namely, 1\u00b0 50' 8\".", "6215": "So the angles at A, above and below, are equal, and the line drawn from A to the ecliptic positions of the limits B, D, is one line (since it is in the one plane of the ecliptic).", "6216": "It was therefore concluded from this that the other line, drawn from A to the limits themselves L, M, is also one line; and further, that what is enclosed within the orbit of Mars is a single plane.", "6217": "Furthermore, if the common intersection of the planes were not at \u03ba in the former diagram (which is A in the present one), but at \u03b2\u03c2 (that is, below A in the present diagram), when the limits L, M are connected with some point on the line BD below A, the angle under which LB appears from that point would be smaller, and the angle under which MD appears would be larger, by about two minutes.", "6218": "It is true that if we are allowed the liberty of making the parallax as great as we please, the arguments of this chapter are easily weakened.", "6219": "But it is a well- documented certainty that it is impossible to allow a parallax great enough to fully enervate this demonstration.", "6220": "Also, since the point of this chapter was demonstrated most soundly in Ch.", "6221": "52, I could take another tack, and instead of demonstrating this point by denying parallax, I could deny parallax, as in Ch.", "6222": "64, by maintaining this point, which has its own demonstration in Ch.", "6223": "52.", "6224": "It does not matter which way you do it.", "6225": "For both points have other demonstrations.", "6226": "The present way occurred to me first, and suited my purpose of showing how everything is in agreement.", "6227": "Chapter 68", "6228": "Whether the inclinations of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic are the same in our time and in Ptolemy\u2019s.", "6229": "Also, on the latitudes of the ecliptic and the nonuniform circuit of the nodes.", "6230": "It was said in Chapter 14 that in any one period of Mars whatever, the obliquity\nor inclination of Mars's plane to the plane of the ecliptic remains fixed.", "6231": "There\nis, however, some doubt whether this obliquity is the same, and fixed, for all\nages.", "6232": "The reason for the doubt is this.", "6233": "In the first volume of the Progymnastica, p.", "6234": "233,1 Brahe demonstrated that  the latitudes of the fixed stars are different today than at the time of Ptolemy, the difference being this: that in the region of the summer solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars increased and those of the southern stars decreased; and, in turn, in the region of the winter solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars decreased and those of the southern stars increased.", "6235": "As one goes from these boundaries towards the equinox points, the alteration of the latitudes diminishes, until near the equinox points there is none at all.", "6236": "This observation of our time we shall accommodate to our principles laid down in Ch.", "6237": "63, thus:", "6238": "It is established that the sphere of the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.", "6239": "Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.", "6240": "Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars are not subject to any motion from place to place, and thus are truly fixed  forever in the same places.", "6241": "The ecliptic, in turn, is the great circle in the sphere of the fixed stars beneath which, for us on earth, the sun ever appears, and which it is seen to traverse annually.", "6242": "And whether this motion belongs to the sun or the earth, in either case it belongs to one of the planets.", "6243": "Therefore, the fixed stars do not themselves contain the cause of the ecliptic: it only results from the annual motion of the earth or of the sun about the center of the world.", "6244": "Thus, since the ecliptic is found to have changed its position with respect to  the fixed stars, it is not the fixed stars that have moved away from the ecliptic, but the latter that has moved away from the fixed stars.", "6245": "The reason for this translation is shown beyond doubt by our principles  of Chapter 63, if, indeed, they are sound.", "6246": "Since the sun, through its most rapid rotation in its space which, for Copernicus, is the center of the world, sets the planets in motion through an emitted species, this rotation will have determinate poles.", "6247": "In the last diagram of Chapter 63, let the body of the sun be IO, and the poles of rotation  be A, E, above which stand the points F, G on the sphere of the fixed stars.", "6248": "The great circle IO of the rotating solar body will thus be arranged beneath some great circle of the fixed stars: let this be ML.", "6249": "This is doubtless one and the same circle beneath the fixed stars, the poles F and G remaining constant, and the dignity of its body declaring that it first instils motion into the others.", "6250": "Nevertheless, the planets are found to move on various circles that are inclined to one another, owing to the natural principles explained in Chapter 63.", "6251": "Therefore, beyond doubt, the various circles of all the planets depend upon this \"royal circle\" ML, described by the rotation of the solar body about its axis AE, and each of them will keep its inclination to this circle constant in quantity, though having a translational motion, since we know by experience that the nodes are transposed.", "6252": "Since the ecliptic, too, is one of the planetary circles, either the sun's or the earth's, it is consistent for it, too, to have some inclination to the royal circle ML, described among the fixed stars by the great circle IO of the solar body.", "6253": "For what would be the reason why the other planets would decline from one another, while the ecliptic alone, standing above the solar or the terrestrial path, coincides exactly with this royal circle ML?", "6254": "Let this therefore be granted: that the ecliptic, properly so called, is inclined to the royal solar circle.", "6255": "Let it be represented to us by the circle KH drawn among the fixed stars, and let its poles be BC.", "6256": "Under these conditions, we easily discover the occasion of the alteration of the fixed stars' latitudes: as the name suggests, these are computed from the true ecliptic and not from that royal solar circle, hitherto unknown.", "6257": "For the intersections or common nodes of the ecliptic, truly and properly so called (as a result of eclipses' occurring only beneath that line along which the sun proceeds), with the circle ML, which we might call the \"mean ecliptic\", will be carried along no less than the nodes of the other planets.", "6258": "Nevertheless, the maximum obliquity MK or LH, which is measured by the distance of the poles FB, GC, remains fixed and constant, as in the  rest of the planets.", "6259": "That is, if about centers F, G, with constant radii FB, GC, small circles be described upon which we suppose the poles of the ecliptic B, C, to revolve, then the circle KH as well will depart from its original position on the sphere of the fixed stars FMG, and over the ages will make the southern limit come to be near the same fixed stars where the northern limit once was.", "6260": "Over a shorter period, however, it will be as follows.", "6261": "Since the limits K, H have not moved far from their fixed stars, their latitudes will be changed by some imperceptible quantity.", "6262": "However, since the nodes have progressed by the same amount from their fixed stars, the latitudes of their fixed stars will be altered more evidently.", "6263": "This is because at the end of the quadrant, near the limit, the sines of the inclinations increase by imperceptible increments, while at the beginning, near the nodes, these increments are quite perceptible.", "6264": "Hence, because no change in the latitudes of the fixed stars is perceived near the equinoxes, while it is noticeable enough near the solstices, we correctly conclude that the limits of the ecliptic's latitudes are near the equinoxes, and the nodes are near the solstices.", "6265": "Therefore, the points K, H will be near the equinoxes.", "6266": "We likewise  conclude this: that since the northern part of the true ecliptic flees from the north, in that the northern latitudes are increasing in Gemini and Cancer, the ecliptic's northern limit is therefore either in Libra, if the nodes progress, or in Aries, if (as is more probable) they retrogress.", "6267": "For the moon's nodes also retrogress, traversing the zodiac in 19 years, while the apogee progresses, traversing it in 8\u00bd years.", "6268": "Now the sun's apogee, or the earth's perihelion, is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, and thus by Chapter 57, the diameter of power, causing the eccentricity, points at the sun when the earth is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Aries.", "6269": "But also, by Chapter 63, the diameter of power that causes the latitude points at the sun when the earth is at the limit, which is in Aries by the present Chapter 68.", "6270": "Therefore, by the same Chapter 63, both powers can be effected by the same diameter of the earth's body.", "6271": "Hence one may argue plausibly that this invisible circle or mean ecliptic and the true one known to us coincide at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer and Capricorn.", "6272": "If the aphelia of all the planets were arranged on a single great circle, we  could say that this is what we are seeking.", "6273": "For then it could be true of all planets, as it is here in the earth's circuits, that the nodes coincide with the apsides, and thus both variations\u2014that of the eccentricity (in height) and that of the the obliquity (in latitude)\u2014are effected by the same diameter of power.", "6274": "This would free us from the great difficulties with which we were left in Chapter 63.", "6275": "And in fact the apogees of the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn fit approximately.", "6276": "For the aphelia of all three superior planets are in the same semicircle, and at the same time in the same northern direction.", "6277": "Therefore, the southern limit of the true ecliptic would be in Libra, and the northern in Aries, which agrees with the above.", "6278": "A full consideration of this question must, however, be deferred until the motions of all the planets are examined with reference to the true ecliptic, the one known to us.", "6279": "Further confirmation of this opinion of a hidden royal circle, projected  from the sun among the fixed stars, is provided by the obliquity of the ecliptic that is in common use, which is computed from the equator, but which we  might more correctly call the equator's latitude from the ecliptic.", "6280": "Now the  equator is the great circle of the earth's body that is intermediate between the poles of the earth's daily rotation on its axis.", "6281": "And the same name of \"equator\" or \"equinoctial\" is given to that region of the sphere of the fixed stars that stands above the terrestrial equator in any era.", "6282": "The same name of \"poles\" is given to the points of the fixed stars that stand above the earth's poles in any era.", "6283": "Hence this axis, and this great circle, are inclined to the ecliptic differently in different eras.", "6284": "For to the extent that the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Cancer, and the southern latitude in Capricorn, is greater today, the equator's latitude from the ecliptic is smaller than it was once, since this obliquity is greatest in Cancer and Capricorn.", "6285": "It was once 23\u00b0 51\u00bd\u2019, while today it is 23\u00b0 31\u00bd\u2019, the difference of 20' being the change in latitude of the fixed stars.", "6286": "It is, however, reasonable to suppose that the circle of the equator with its axis and poles would forever decline from the poles of this ecliptic HK by an equal and fixed distance, if the true ecliptic were the world's primary circle.", "6287": "But the ecliptic has changed, and the inclination of this axis to the ecliptic (and with it the inclination of the equator, to which this axis belongs) has been altered, so that to the extent that the ecliptic has receded from the fixed stars in Cancer, it has approached the equator.", "6288": "Therefore, the equator appears to maintain a constant inclination to some other circle.", "6289": "So a great cause, and a great dignity, ought to belong to this hidden circle.", "6290": "And thus from all these plausible arguments there arises a royal circle LOM, middle among the circles of the planets, to which all the planets, and Mars with them, maintain a constant inclination.", "6291": "The example of the moon should not trouble us, whose inclination to the ecliptic, but not to any other great circle, is a constant 5\u00b0, both in the past and today, even though the ecliptic has been moved.", "6292": "For there is an enormous difference between the moon and the other planets.", "6293": "The orbs of the others encircle the center of the world.", "6294": "The moon's orb alone (roughly speaking) is outside the center and is transported from place to place.", "6295": "The others in common circle the sun, while the moon circles the earth.", "6296": "The eccentricities of the others and the whole theory of longitude and latitude originate from the sun, while those of the moon originate from the moving earth.", "6297": "The sun sweeps the others around in a circle, while the earth so moves the moon.", "6298": "What wonder, then, if the moon keeps the limits of its latitude constant with respect to the changeable ecliptic HK, beneath which lies the terrestrial circle, while the other planets do so with respect to some other invariable circle, such as LOIM?", "6299": "So the moon should not prevent us from giving credence to this theory.", "6300": "It is therefore granted that Mars's orbit is inclined at a constant angle to some circle that maintains its position beneath the same fixed stars, such as  LOIM.", "6301": "It follows that this same orbit of Mars has different inclinations to the ecliptic HK in different ages, since in certain of its parts it leaves the fixed stars it originally lay beneath and moves on to others.", "6302": "This only follows, however, if we grant that the nodes of Mars and the nodes of the earth, that is, the intersections of these orbits with the invisible circle LOIM, are not always carried over the same intervals in the heavens, some being faster than others.", "6303": "An authentic example of this was just given.", "6304": "For since the equator maintains a constant inclination to this invisible circle LOIM, while the ecliptic is meanwhile moved, the declination of the equator from the ecliptic is consequently perceived to be changeable.", "6305": "Let A be the pole of the mean ecliptic, or the point upon which the straight line falls that is drawn from the center of the sun through the pole of the solar body.", "6306": "About center A with radius AB of 23\u00b0 42' (or thereabouts) let a smaller circle be described, and let B, C be the positions of the north pole of the world, or the points upon which falls a line from the center of the earth's body through the pole of the daily rotation on the same body, B at the time of Ptolemy, and C at our time.", "6307": "If the nodes of the ecliptic also retrogress, the northern limit must be placed near the fixed stars in the region of Aries and Pisces.", "6308": "For the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Gemini and Cancer has increased, as was previously said.", "6309": "Let the midpoint D between B and C be taken, marking the position of the pole of the equator at an intermediate time, and let AD be joined.", "6310": "Thus the circle AD extended will pass through the solstice of the intermediate time.", "6311": "From A at right angles to AD let AE be drawn, which, being  extended, will pass through the vernal equinox of the intermediate time.", "6312": "Therefore, close to the line AE there would be the pole of the circle beneath which the orbit and circuit of the earth was once arranged.", "6313": "And because the northern limit is in Aries, let EA be extended in the direction of A, and let the point I be taken on the extension below A. Thus the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic would be at I. About center A with radius AI let a small circle be described, on which let another point O be taken, nearer to C than I is to B. And let O be the present pole of the ecliptic, 23\u00b0 31\u00bd\u2019 from C, while I, the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic, is 23\u00b0 51\u00bd\u2019 from B. This will be the theory of the ecliptic's altered obliquity and of the altered latitude of the fixed stars, except that the size of the small circle OI is not known to us.", "6314": "For the ecliptic's 20' alteration of obliquity can be produced in various ways.", "6315": "And because O is today's pole of the ecliptic, and OC points towards the beginning of Cancer, let CP be the eighth part of the circle, and P the middle of Leo, where the northern limit of Mars is today.", "6316": "Let PO be extended beyond O, and let GI be drawn through I nearly parallel to PO, but slanting somewhat forward in longitude (for the sidereal position of Mars's limit was once a little farther forward than today), and let it be extended beyond I. And about A let a small circle be described, intersecting PO at F and GI at H. Let the size of the circle be sufficient to make OF greater than IH.", "6317": "And let the pole of the circle beneath which the circuit of Mars is arranged, be placed at F today, and at H in the past.", "6318": "Today\u2019s obliquity OF, or the inclination of the plane of Mars to the ecliptic, will be greater, and the Ptolemaic obliquity HI will be smaller.", "6319": "Nevertheless the pole of Mars\u2019s orbit H, F would have moved from H to F keeping at a constant distance AH, AF from A.\nAnd since the pole of the Martian orbit has traversed a fairly large arc from H to F, whether forward or backward, but at the same time the pole of the ecliptic has gone from I to O about the same point A, the pole of Mars would appear to be nearly at rest, since IH and OF are nearly parallel.", "6320": "A great inequality in the motion of the nodes must indeed follow if it is true  that the poles of the individual planets circle some common pole in different times.", "6321": "For there is an anomaly originating from this source in the precession of  the equinoxes, whose treatment is very much like the present ones.", "6322": "I have stated what is in agreement with the principles established in this work, and by what hypotheses this can be brought about, so that the inclinations of the planes can be made different in different ages.", "6323": "Let us now examine the observations of Ptolemy.", "6324": "For since the northern latitude of Mars is with Cor Leonis, a northern star, while the southern latitude is with the southern stars of Capricorn, it is reasonable that the same happened to Mars's maximum latitudes as happened to those stars: they both increased.", "6325": "For the stars' latitudes did increase, the northern ones around the summer solstice, and the southern ones around the winter solstice.", "6326": "Ptolemy therefore said that Mars's maximum observed northern latitude was 4\u00b0 20', while today it is 4\u00b0 32' ^2.", "6327": "This confirms our opinion, since he shows a maximum latitude that is 12' smaller than today's, while the nodes stayed at approximately the same distance from aphelion as they are today.", "6328": "On the other hand, he makes the southern latitude about 7\u00b0, while today it could also be that much, namely, 6\u00b0 52\u2153\u2018.", "6329": "We are therefore left undecided by his observations.", "6330": "For concerning those 12' in the northern latitude, it should be noted that the smallest graduations on his instruments were 10 minutes, and that he usually supposed an error amounting to one of these parts.", "6331": "Also, the difference between the Greek symbols for 20' and 40' is very small and slippery, often neglected by translators ^3.", "6332": "Nevertheless, the Arabic says 20' here.", "6333": "There is nothing besides this in Ptolemy that can lead us to a judgement of how these matters stood in antiquity.", "6334": "For the observation examined in the following Chapter 69 is shown to be in error.", "6335": "Therefore, as long as we are wanting suitable observations from antiquity, circumstances compel us to leave this discussion of the motion of the nodes, along with many other matters, to posterity, if, indeed, it should please God to vouchsafe the human race a length of time in this world sufficient to work through such remaining questions thoroughly.", "6336": "Chapter 69", "6337": "A consideration of three Ptolemaic observations, and the correction of the mean motion and of the motion of the aphelion and nodes.", "6338": "1", "6339": "From all antiquity, there have survived no more than five written observations of the star Mars, as well as one of extreme antiquity noted by Aristotle, who saw Mars occulted by the dark part of the half moon.", "6340": "However, neither the year nor the time of day were given.", "6341": "Nevertheless, I have discovered, using a very lengthy process of induction extending over the 50 years from Aristotle's fifteenth year to the end of his life, that this could not have happened on any other day than the evening of April 4 in the 357th year before the commonly accepted epoch of Christ, when the 21-year-old Aristotle was, as we know from Diogenes Laertius, a student of Eudoxus ^2.", "6342": "The second observation, obtained from the Chaldeans, was preserved for us by Ptolemy.", "6343": "This was made  on the morning of January 18, 272 BC, when Mars occulted the northern star in the head of Scorpius ^3.", "6344": "Here again, no particular time was given.", "6345": "The other four were by Ptolemy himself, using an astrolabe to measure Mars's distance from fixed stars.", "6346": "However, he reports only the zodiacal position at the exact moment of Mars's opposition to the sun's mean motion ^4.", "6347": "Upon these few observations, arguments of the greatest moment are to be founded; or, if this is not possible, astronomy must remain incomplete.", "6348": "First, through the four Ptolemaic observations, the epoch of the mean motions, related to the fixed stars, belonging to Ptolemy's time, is to be found, and by a comparison of this with the modern data the mean motion itself is to be determined.", "6349": "Next, it seems possible to use the Chaldean observation to inquire whether the solar eccentricity was really once greater than it is today.", "6350": "And then, using both this observation and the Aristotelian one, if the time were known, one could hazard a guess at Mars's latitude at those times.", "6351": "But by God immortal, what is this path upon which we shall be treading?", "6352": "For we have hardly anything from Ptolemy that we could not with good reason call into question prior to its becoming of use to us in arriving at the requisite degree of accuracy.", "6353": "I", "6354": "First, at the times set out, he records the mean position of the sun by a calculation that depends upon observation of the equinoxes and solstices.", "6355": "The sun reveals the beginning of Aries, not by pointing a finger at the place, but by a blind conjecture of the time.", "6356": "For we call the beginning of Aries that point that the sun occupies when the day is observed to equal the nights.", "6357": "What if Ptolemy had been in error as to the time?", "6358": "We are not wanting conjectures.", "6359": "First, he does not give his method of observing it.", "6360": "My hope is that he observed the meridian altitudes, for by induction from these the moment of the sun's entering the northern hemisphere is obtained without error.", "6361": "But what if he had observed it using Alexandrian armillaries, where refraction could have put him off?", "6362": "He himself clearly suggests that he did so, when he says that the equinox was measured twice on the same day using these armillaries.", "6363": "He ascribes this to instrumental error; I, however, suspect that the error arose from refraction ^5.", "6364": "Let it stand, however: let him have observed it through meridian altitudes.", "6365": "There is another suspicion that unwelcomely but most forcefully insinuates itself: the moments of the equinoxes recorded by Ptolemy do not agree within a day and a half when compared with the previous observations of Hipparchus and the later ones of Albategnius6 and Brahe, all of which conspire in a single equality.", "6366": "The Ptolemaic equinoxes alone deviate.", "6367": "This fact has given rise to many extremely complicated opinions on the heavens, and gave birth to the motions of trepidation and libration, all of which are brought to ruin once one sees that the observations after Ptolemy always agree to the point of equality with the most ancient ones of Hipparchus.", "6368": "Ptolemy nevertheless supports himself by comparing the vernal equinoxes with the autumnal.", "6369": "For if, as a result of instrumental error, he had pronounced the true equinox to be on the following day, when it had occurred on the  previous one, the autumnal equinox would have been pronounced to be on the previous day when it belonged on the following one.", "6370": "If two days were thus subtracted from the length of the summer, a great alteration in the sun's eccentricity would have resulted.", "6371": "Nevertheless, following his observations, he left this at the same quantity found by Hipparchus.", "6372": "So no alternative is left us but to trust Ptolemy in believing him to have observed correctly the time at which the sun stood at the beginning of Aries.", "6373": "II", "6374": "Once a beginning is made, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is found through  observation, it is a trivial matter to use the sun's declinations on each day to report its elongation from the point occupied by the sun at the time stated to be the moment of the equinox, whatever it might be or in whichever sphere it might be established.", "6375": "For various authors thought up a variety of spheres for this purpose: after the eighth and ninth spheres established by Ptolemy,  others have set up a tenth, and most recent authors an eleventh and a twelfth, all through the merest of speculations, against which overabundance of mechanisms7 Brahe vehemently inveighed.", "6376": "He never, however, told me what he intended to substitute in their place, nor did he leave it in writing anywhere.", "6377": "Copernicus, on the other hand, acted ingeniously and wittily (in the common  opinion), and wisely (in mine), in removing his eyes from the heavens and seeking that point in the globe of the earth, above which, in the sphere of the fixed stars, there stands a point, determinate for any age you please, as was said in Ch.", "6378": "68.", "6379": "However, this is not the place to discuss this matter further.", "6380": "III", "6381": "There follows a demonstration of the equation, which depends upon the sun's  observed entry into the beginnings of the cardinal signs.", "6382": "For when the equation is subtracted from or added to the sun's apparent position, the sun's mean motion is established with respect to the point which the sun is observed to occupy at the time of the equinox.", "6383": "Here too, as to the quantity of the equation, there is greater uncertainty than before over the equinox or the beginning of the zodiac.", "6384": "For today that equation appears to be 20' less than the quantity which Hipparchus appears to have demonstrated for himself, and which Ptolemy retained.", "6385": "Nor is there sufficiently good reason why we should say that the ratio of the orbs is different today from what it once was.", "6386": "For affirmations of the greatest moment require the most solid evidence, and this we are lacking.", "6387": "And those observations cannot be that accurate, especially concerning the entry into Cancer and Capricorn.", "6388": "If we substitute the modern equations for Ptolemy's, we shall not change his observations as much as Ptolemy himself says he can discern in observing, nor as much as the Ptolemaic observations can be vitiated by the matter of refraction.", "6389": "For we can with  certainty name the day of the Ptolemaic equinox observation, though meanwhile remaining uncertain about the time of day.", "6390": "And here, the partnership of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes is no such defense against the small error we are considering here as it was before against a large one.", "6391": "That the equations of Ptolemy's day were really equal to ours, the constancy of the modern ones argues.", "6392": "For those found today by Brahe, and those found several centuries ago by Albategnius and Arzachel,8 are nearly the same.", "6393": "There is therefore suspicion that the equation of the sun used by Ptolemy is in error, since it is deduced from erroneous apparent positions of the sun.", "6394": "Consequently, Ptolemy did not relate Mars to either the sun's mean or its apparent position, without the chance of error.", "6395": "Nevertheless, there is this consolation, that we need to make use of the sun's apparent position, the comprehensive argument for which was given above.", "6396": "We can, however, proceed on a twofold path: either we believe Ptolemy on the equinoxes, or, using the modern equations, we apply a correction to the Ptolemaic equinoxes, making the vernal equinox three hours later than that noted by Ptolemy, and the autumnal earlier by the same amount, the result being an error of 8' in the sun's declination at each place.", "6397": "Ptolemy's instruments were doubtless not calibrated with divisions any finer than 10'.", "6398": "And Hipparchus assigns an uncertainty of one such division.", "6399": "For this reason, the times, too, that the sun takes to traverse the quadrants of the zodiac, were not expressed more precisely than to within a quarter of a day.", "6400": "So much for the true length of summer and winter.", "6401": "IV", "6402": "But what shall we now say of the sun's entry into Cancer and Capricorn, upon which the apogee and the setting out of the equations depends?", "6403": "And of how easily a quarter of a day can diminish the vernal quadrant of the zodiac, and increase the autumnal?", "6404": "For the sun's entry into Cancer is quite imperceptible.", "6405": "Nor can I be persuaded that Hipparchus and Ptolemy examined the very moment of this entry, ignoring the intermediate points.", "6406": "I find it more credible that throughout the summer they were carefully noting the sun's declinations, and were matching up the equal ones on both sides of the solstice, taking as the true entry of the sun into Cancer the time intermediate between the moments of equal declinations.", "6407": "In this way, if a comparison had been made of positions near to the solstice, there would indeed be little error, but there still could have occurred as much as a quarter of a day, during which time 15' of the sun's motion elapse.", "6408": "Therefore, even if the equinoxes were perfectly certain, it is nonetheless possible that there be an excess or defect of a quarter of a degree in the sun's position in the two segments about the solstice, and that the apogee should then fall eight degrees farther forward or farther back.", "6409": "So much for the sun's motion.", "6410": "V", "6411": "Now, as for the observations of Mars itself, even if Ptolemy in fact managed to line the astrolabe up accurately on the fixed stars, there is still clearly no more certainty about Mars's zodiacal position (just as in the previous consideration of the sun's position) than there is about the positions of our fixed stars.", "6412": "If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars.", "6413": "Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error.", "6414": "For consider both the manner in which it is found and the argument of error.", "6415": "In the year 2 of Antonine Ptolemy sought it through the half-illuminated moon ^9.", "6416": "Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon.", "6417": "Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*.", "6418": "Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed.", "6419": "For the measurement was made at sunset.", "6420": "But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree.", "6421": "Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial.", "6422": "Thus it appears that half a degree must be added to the positions of the fixed stars at the time of Ptolemy.", "6423": "Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition.", "6424": "So when these four observed positions of Mars are presented by Ptolemy: 21\u00b0 0' Gemini, 28\u00b0 50' Leo, 2\u00b0 34' Sagittarius, 1\u00b0 36' Sagittarius; we should take these: 21\u00b0 30' Gemini, 29\u00b0 20' Leo, 3\u00b0 4' Sagittarius, 2\u00b0 6' Sagittarius.", "6425": "Now Ptolemy actually defended himself against such presumption, affirming that he frequently had sought out this one thing, namely, the elongation of the fixed stars from the moon, of the  moon from the sun, and hence the distance of the fixed stars from the sun and from the equinox point, and had always found it to be the same.", "6426": "So although he produced only one observation in order to demonstrate the method, it is nonetheless credible that he consulted several observations, at both the rising and the setting of the sun or moon, finally choosing the one which he saw to be intermediate among many operations that produced various positions.", "6427": "Now this argument over 30' seems to be irrelevant to Mars's mean  motion, if indeed on these four occasions Mars, as it was observed with respect to the fixed stars, can be referred to them, without consideration of the equinox point, whose distance is uncertain.", "6428": "This is the method I used in Ch.", "6429": "17 above to investigate the position of the aphelion in Ptolemy's times.", "6430": "We are nevertheless hindered in this respect, that the observed positions of Mars are to be referred to a point opposite the sun's apparent position.", "6431": "This task can never proceed correctly unless the distances of both Mars and the sun from the common equinox point is previously known, since the arc of the true elongations of Mars from the sun cannot be deduced otherwise than through these components (so to speak).", "6432": "If, at the moment taken as the true opposition of the bodies, the planet should appear to be 30' beyond the sun's true positions, the planet still has some involvement with the second inequality, and is not yet ready for an enquiry into the first inequality.", "6433": "And at apogee, these 30' in the equation of the orb occupy a large arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even larger portion of the time or the mean motion.", "6434": "At perigee the opposite takes place.", "6435": "For this equation of the center occupies a small arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even smaller portion of the mean motion.", "6436": "Therefore, anyone who says that on these four occasions Mars was observed 30' farther along on the zodiac, says in effect that at the equinoctial point Mars's mean motion was many minutes farther back at apogee, and a few minutes back at perigee.", "6437": "And since the arc on the eccentric is smaller than this 30' arc resulting from faulty observation, neither Mars's eccentric position nor even its sidereal position are as far forward as Mars itself appears to have moved with respect to the fixed stars, the difference being that quantity by which the arc on the eccentric differs from the 30' arc in the observation.", "6438": "And since this arc is large at aphelion, differing but little from the 30' arc in the observation, and the  opposite at perigee, it therefore finally will follow that at aphelion a small amount, and at perihelion more, must be subtracted from Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars, if we accept that the fixed stars are 30' farther forward on the zodiac.", "6439": "Thus not only is the mean motion made smaller (although by a much smaller quantity than the 30' resulting from faulty observation), but also the arrangement of the three acronychal observations used by Ptolemy is disturbed, whence must arise another aphelion and another eccentricity.", "6440": "However, this will cause us no trouble later.", "6441": "For we may neglect it, even if the observations introduce something large, as long as there is no suspicion of error in the fixed stars, since it is certain that they do not have the same precision as the Brahean ones.", "6442": "So we shall use the form of equation found through the Brahean observations, as if they remain the same throughout the ages.", "6443": "Since we have encountered three forks in the road, one concerning the sun's eccentricity, another concerning the position of the sun's apogee, and the third concerning the zodiacal positions of the fixed stars and of Mars, there are therefore eight ways of establishing the mean motions and the aphelion at the moments of observation, even if, ignoring the zodiac, we compute only with reference to the fixed stars.", "6444": "Let the first investigation retain all the Ptolemaic data concerning the sun and the fixed stars.", "6445": "Since the positions of the sun's mean motion were 21\u00b0 0' Sagittarius, 28\u00b0 50' Aquarius, and 2\u00b0 34' Gemini, and the sun's apogee was 5\u00b0 30' Gemini, the apparent positions of the sun were 21\u00b0 40' Sagittarius, 1\u00b0 13' Pisces, and 2\u00b0 41' Gemini, all three beyond opposition ^10.", "6446": "The true opposition therefore precede them.", "6447": "And since the diurnal motion at 21\u00b0 Gemini (Cancer, today) is about 23', and that of the sun, 61', and the sum is 1\u00b0 24', those 41' therefore require 8 hours,11 at which time Mars was visible at 21\u00b0 8' Gemini, opposite the sun's apparent position.", "6448": "Likewise, at 29\u00b0 Leo (Virgo, today) Mars's diurnal motion is usually taken to be 24', the sun's diurnal motion 59', and the sum 1\u00b0 23'.", "6449": "Therefore, a difference of 2\u00b0 23' requires 1 day 17 hours 21 minutes, at which time Mars was visible at 29\u00b0 31' Leo.", "6450": "Finally, at 3\u00b0 Gemini (Cancer, today) Mars's diurnal motion is 23', the sun's 57', the sum 1\u00b0 20', by which it is shown that for 7' there are required 2h 6m, at which time Mars was visible at 2\u00b0 36' Sagittarius.", "6451": "12 13 14", "6452": "To the first interval there corresponds a mean sidereal motion of 80\u00b0 57' 14\" beyond the complete cycles, and to the second, 96\u00b0 16' 24\".", "6453": "But in the former instance the apparent motion of Mars was 68\u00b0 21' 20\" beyond the complete cycles, with precession over the interval subtracted, in the amount that it was at that time ^15.", "6454": "In the latter instance, the apparent motion was 93\u00b0 2' 20\".", "6455": "Now let the hypothesis previously under investigation, established on the basis of the most recent observations, be brought in, and let the question be raised, at what anomalistic position do the apparent motions on the eccentric correspond to the mean motions, as I have just now given them?", "6456": "After a few  trials, this is found: If for the last time the aphelion of Mars is placed at 0\u00b0 41' Leo, and for the remaining times somewhat before that, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, while at the first time the mean anomaly is 46\u00b0 37', at the second, 34\u00b0 21', and the third, 130\u00b0 37\u00bd\u2019; and thus the elongation from the equinox at the middle time was 5s 4\u00b0 59' 20\", then by the modern hypothesis of the equations the star Mars is placed at 21\u00b0 7' Gemini for the first time, 29\u00b0 [31']16 Leo for the second, and 2\u00b0 37\u00bd' Sagittarius for the third, fortuitously precise.", "6457": "For the foundations are not such as to allow one to hope for such precision.", "6458": "Had Ptolemy made note of more oppositions of his day, we would doubtless be experiencing greater difficulty.", "6459": "For with three solar oppositions it is handled easily ^17.", "6460": "Compare this aphelion with Ch.", "6461": "17.", "6462": "Second, the Ptolemaic equation and apogee being retained, let 30 minutes be added to the fixed stars.", "6463": "The result will be slightly different.", "6464": "For since Mars is half a degree beyond opposition to the sun, the corrected opposition will follow.", "6465": "The sums of the diurnal motions were 1\u00b0 24', 1\u00b0 23', and 1\u00b0 20'.", "6466": "Therefore, for the extra 30' the corresponding times come out almost exactly the same, to be added to all three, namely, about 8 hours 40 minutes.", "6467": "To this there corresponds 8\u00bd\u2019 of Mars's apparent motion, which is to be subtracted from these 30'.", "6468": "The remaining 21\u00bd\u2019 are to be added to the planet's positions, placing it at 21\u00b0 29\u00bd\u2019 Gemini, 29\u00b0 52\u00bd\u2019 Leo, and 2\u00b0 57\u00bd' Sagittarius.", "6469": "The intervals both of time and of zodiacal positions will remain almost exactly the same.", "6470": "Thus the distribution of the mean anomaly among these observations, which was just now found, will also be the same.", "6471": "Only the aphelion will be transposed by the same number of minutes, so that on the last date it is at 1\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 Leo.", "6472": "It therefore has to be moved 8\u00bd\u2019 back among the fixed stars.", "6473": "And the mean motion from the equinox will be increased by the above mentioned 21\u00bd\u2019, but it will be 8 hours 40 minutes longer.", "6474": "And to these hours there correspond 11' 24\" of mean motion.", "6475": "Therefore, at the proposed time, the mean motion from the equinox will be only 10' greater than before.", "6476": "But the positions of the fixed stars are 30' farther removed from the equinox.", "6477": "Therefore, Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars has proceeded 20' less than before.", "6478": "Third, the sun's apogee being transposed by 11 or 12 degrees,18 while the longitude and equation of the fixed stars remains the same.", "6479": "Then on the first date the sun will be 20' back in position;19 on the middle date practically nothing will be changed; and on the last date it will be 21\u2019 farther along in position, owing to the altered equations of the sun.", "6480": "Therefore, the first opposition will be 4 hours later,20 and Mars will be the same number of minutes farther back in position, while the last opposition will occur 4\u2153 hours earlier,21 with Mars the same number of minutes farther along in position.", "6481": "22 23", "6482": "The first interval of time becomes smaller.", "6483": "So also the corresponding mean  motion is 5' 15\" smaller, so as to be 80\u00b0 53'.", "6484": "The second interval of time again becomes smaller.", "6485": "Therefore, the mean motion corresponding to it is 5' 40\" smaller, namely, 96\u00b0 10' 48\".", "6486": "So, since to the two mean motions, both smaller, there corresponds a greater apparent motion than before, and on the supposition that the mean anomaly is the same as before for both, the apparent motion is greater by about 9', it therefore appears that Mars has to move down from aphelion.", "6487": "However, the first interval is unchanged unless a great descent is made, while the second [is corrected] by a descent of about 36\u2019 ^24.", "6488": "Therefore, if we were to indulge in our enquiry, and not take the modern hypothesis as given, we would arrive at a completely different hypothesis with a new eccentricity ^25.", "6489": "And if, on the other hand, these three observations of Ptolemy were perfectly certain, this would constitute the basis for an argument that he established the sun's apogee correctly.", "6490": "But when 36' are subtracted from Mars's aphelion, placing it at 0\u00b0 3' Leo26 for the last time, and when its mean motion is so adjusted that for the middle time the [mean] anomaly is 34\u00b0 58\u00bd\u2019 with longitude from the equinoctial of 5s 5\u00b0 0' 50\", the following observations result:27", "6491": "Again, an accurate enough approach.", "6492": "For we cannot hope that the observations were of such certainty.", "6493": "So, whether the sun's apogee is known correctly or not, the distance of the mean motion from the equinoctial is certain within 1\u00bd\u2019.", "6494": "Fourth, the same things will be changed in the computed positions of the second case, and in establishing the mean longitude, that is, by transposing the apogee and the fixed stars ^28.", "6495": "Fifth, the sun's apogee and the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars remaining the same, the modern solar eccentricity is used.", "6496": "Thus, while the first and last positions of the sun remain almost exactly the same, the sun's apparent position will be changed in the middle observation by 20'.", "6497": "For the former fall near the sun's apsides, where the equation is small, while the latter is near the middle longitude, where the equation caused by the eccentricity is maximum.", "6498": "And since in Aquarius the equation is additive, when 20' are taken away from the equation, the sun will be moved back through the same number of

29\u00b0 27' Leo ^30.", "6501": "The earlier time interval and its mean motion is increased, and the apparent motion is decreased, while the later time interval is decreased, and the apparent motion is increased.", "6502": "So once again, more evidently than before, the application of this correction calls upon us to change the hypothesis, unless we had sworn allegiance to the words and numbers of the hypothesis of this era by our best judgement.", "6503": "For to move the planet forward a smaller distance in a greater time near apogee, and a greater distance in a smaller time near perigee, nothing can suffice but to increase the  eccentricity.", "6504": "If everything were kept the same, as in the first case, the results for the first and third times would indeed again be the same as then, namely 21\u00b0 7' Gemini and 2\u00b0 37\u00bd' Sagittarius.", "6505": "But in the middle position, it would come out to be 29\u00b0 36\u00bd\u2019 Leo, where it ought to have been 29\u00b0 27' Leo, a difference of 9\u00bd' ^31.", "6506": "To eliminate this, the aphelion ought to remain in about the same place, but the mean motion should omit 3\u00bd\u2019.", "6507": "Then the results will be:32", "6508": "Sixth, the same change of the second case will occur, if we at once change both the sun's eccentricity and the longitude of the fixed stars.", "6509": "Seventh, if on the other hand we at once change both the eccentricity and apogee of the sun, combining the third and fifth cases, the fundamentals will be these ^33.", "6510": "34", "6511": "The first interval remains the same as in the first case, while the last is much altered.", "6512": "And because more of the path is traversed in a smaller time, it must descend farther down towards perigee.", "6513": "To 8 hours of mean motion correspond 10' 30\", to which add the extra 8 minutes of travel ^35.", "6514": "The total is thus 18\u00bd , which we shall make up if we move the aphelion back by 1\u00b0 12', putting it at 29\u00b0 29' Cancer for the last time, with a mean anomaly of 131\u00b0 45' ^36.", "6515": "Therefore, [the position of] its mean motion is 11\u00b0 4\u2019 Sagittarius,37 which, in the first case, was 11\u00b0 18\u00bd\u2019 Sagittarius.", "6516": "From this we compute:38", "6517": "Finally, with alterations in all three data that we have taken from Ptolemy, the result will be the combined effect of the seventh and second cases.", "6518": "It is therefore apparent that the epoch of the mean motion with respect to the equinox and the fixed stars is not much changed by an alteration in the sun's eccentricity, or in the apogee, or in both at once, but that it is only changed when the positions of the fixed stars are altered.", "6519": "For the third case adds 1' 30\", the fifth subtracts 3' 30\", and the seventh subtracts 4\u2019 30\".", "6520": "The second case alone subtracts 10\u201939 from the mean motion measured from the equinoctial, and 20' measured from the fixed stars ^40.", "6521": "As a result of this, two epochs of motion at the time of Ptolemy are  established.", "6522": "But what if we make something suitable by combining the second and  fifth cases, by which we can hold simply to the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars, eliminating any need for us to suspect that there might be two epochs of Mars's mean motion?", "6523": "For Ptolemy explicitly affirms that in his observation he found the moon's distance from the sun to be 92\u00b0 8\u2019, the same amount he computed from his hypothesis of the moon's motions.", "6524": "Ptolemy would have spoken truly: he would have been skillful enough in observing, and would have plainly seen this distance on his instrument to be the same as that prescribed by his hypothesis of the moon's motions, which was not in error near the quadratures.", "6525": "From this, I argue thus.", "6526": "If the sun had been at 3\u00b0 5' Pisces,41 where Ptolemy placed it using his eccentricity, the moon could not have appeared 92\u00b0 8' from it, the measure that is just and computed from the hypothesis, for the reason that the setting sun reaches the eye by refraction, and appears higher than it actually is (and thus 30\u2019 farther to the east).", "6527": "But because the arc from the moon to the sun was observed to be 92\u00b0 8\u2019, and because of refraction, this was in actual fact 92\u00b0 38\u2019, the sun was therefore not at 3\u00b0 3' Pisces, but at 2\u00b0 33' Pisces.", "6528": "And this is in agreement with the fifth case, where we said that Ptolemy's maximum additive equation (which occurs at 5\u00b0 Pisces) becomes 20' smaller when today's eccentricity is used, thus putting the sun at 2\u00b0 43' Pisces instead of 3\u00b0 3' Pisces.", "6529": "And so, on the supposition that refraction is universal throughout all places and times, as is discussed in the Optics,42 and supposing this observation to stand, we arrive at the conclusion that the sun's eccentricity is less than that reckoned by Ptolemy.", "6530": "It should not trouble you that I spoke of a refraction of 30', while this diminution is but 20'.", "6531": "For if you consider well, since 30\u00b0 Taurus had culminated, 1\u00b0 Pisces was then setting at Alexandria, and the sun, being at 3\u00b0 Pisces, consequently had an altitude of two degrees, or perhaps even more, and therefore the refraction was less than 30'; nor was all the refraction simply longitudinal.", "6532": "Thus these two causes43 were almost exactly the same in quantity, and cancelled one another.", "6533": "However, anyone who knows anything of the Ptolemaic reckoning of the fixed stars will not consider this difference of ten minutes worth mentioning.", "6534": "For example, Ptolemy comes up with an interval of 54\u00b0 10' between Cor Leonis and Spica Virginis, although in the heavens themselves it is not more than 53\u00b0 59'.", "6535": "Let us therefore follow whither our inclinations and our arguments lead: as in the first case, in the second year of Antonine, on the 12th day of Epiphi, at the 8th hour, at Alexandria in Egypt, let Mars's mean motion from the  equinoctial be 11\u00b0 18' 30\" Sagittarius.", "6536": "This time corresponds to the common year of Christ 139 May 27.", "6537": "The difference of meridians between Hven and Alexandria is nearly two hours, from the most recent geographical tables.", "6538": "Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11\u00b0 18' 30\".", "6539": "But in that year, Cor Leonis had a longitude of 2\u00b0 30' Leo, that is, 4s 2\u00b0 30' 0\".", "6540": "Therefore Mars's mean motion was 4s 8\u00b0 48' 30\" from Cor Leonis.", "6541": "But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0\u00b0 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24\u00b0 15' 45\".", "6542": "Therefore Mars was 7s 6\u00b0 31' 45\" from Cor Leonis.", "6543": "For each year nearly one second must be subtracted.", "6544": "Therefore, at noon on 1 January in the first year of Christ, at Hven, it is elongated in its mean motion by 5s 8\u00b0 52' 45\" from Cor Leonis ^45.", "6545": "And so much for Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars.", "6546": "The motion of the aphelion will come out a little different from what it was above in Ch.", "6547": "17.", "6548": "For in the year of Christ 139 May 27 it was at 0\u00b0 41' Leo, while Cor Leonis was at 2\u00b0 30' Leo.", "6549": "It therefore preceded the latter by 1\u00b0 49'.", "6550": "But today, in 1599 May 27, it is at 28\u00b0 58' 50\" Leo, while Cor Leonis is at 24\u00b0 15' 45\" Leo.", "6551": "over an interval of 1460 Julian years, which makes an annual motion of a little greater than 16\".", "6552": "Therefore, the root of the Christian era, at noon on January 1, has this aphelion 2\u00b0 27' before Cor Leonis.", "6553": "On the mean motion of the sun with respect to the fixed stars, treated in passing, for future reference.", "6554": "In the year of Christ 139 Pharmouthi 9, which is February 23, at sunset at 5h 30m, 3h 30m at Hven, the apparent position of the sun was computed as 3\u00b0 3' Pisces; therefore, the mean position was 0\u00b0 43' Pisces.", "6555": "But the longitude of Cor Leonis was found to be 2\u00b0 30' Leo.", "6556": "Therefore, the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 1\u00b0 47' 0\".", "6557": "But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12\u00b0 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24\u00b0

latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same

1\u00b0 20', probably greater.", "6657": "And so Mars has a smaller northern latitude than either of the stars mentioned, and passed beneath both.", "6658": "For it is certain that even if we are too

in the northern part of the brow there are three stars in the form of a triangle, Mars was sighted in the middle of them, and was thus \"placed upon the northern brow\" of Scorpius, it having simply been made one of that number of stars that are in the northern part of the brow of Scorpius.", "6664": "This interpretation is furthered by the observer's having said \"northern brow\" rather than
