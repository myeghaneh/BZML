      "For, in the Ptolemaic form, as the sine of the angle AEC is to AC, the whole sine is to AE, which becomes 101,766 when DCE is 90°. ['101,766']\n",
      "We can eliminate even this extremely slight difference in the equations by positing 20,103 as Mars's eccentricity in the Ptolemaic form where Brahe, in the Copernican form, found it to be 20,160. ['20,103']\n",
      "Let the magnitudes on the line δγα be taken as follows: let δα be the quantity of the sun’s eccentricity, 3584; δγ the eccentricity of Mars, 30,138 of the same parts, and the angle αδγ 47° 59¼’, which is the angular difference between the sun’s and Mars’s apogees. ['30,138']\n",
      "Now let βξ be 100,000 and αγ be 18,034 of the same parts. ['100,000']\n",
      "Therefore, in the right triangle βχφ, since βφ is 100,000 (β being the center of the eccentric φ) and χβ is 6732, χφ will be 99,773. ['100,000']\n",
      "Above, δγ was 19,763 in the new units, and the angle at γ right. ['19,763']\n",
      "Thus 60 is to 41 as 100,000 is to 65,656½, the appropriate magnitude for βυ. ['100,000']\n",
      "Therefore, in the Ptolemaic form of the first inequality, the eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or a little less. ['20,160']\n",
      "For he makes the center of the (Copernican*)  eccentric distant from the center of vision by 13,680 units, while the point of equality in turn is another 3,780 of these units beyond that. ['13,680']\n",
      "But as BG, 53,866, is to 100,000, so is 100,000 to AC. ['100,000']\n",
      "24 25 So the whole eccentricity remains 18,564 but that of the eccentric 11,332 and of the equant 7,232. ['18,564']\n",
      "Therefore, in order that CGA, the angle of the equation, remain unchanged, the same 18,564 is to be increased in the same ratio for Tycho and Copernicus: \n",
      "The composite Copernican-Tychonic eccentricity. ['18,564']\n",
      "Second, that Ptolemy's figure for the sun's eccentricity was correct: 4153, where the semidiameter of the orbit is 100,000 (Ptolemy book 3 Ch. ['100,000']\n",
      "Fifth, that the eccentricity of Mars was 20,000 where its semidiameter is 100,000 (in the same chapter). ['20,000']\n",
      "Sixth, that the ratio of the epicycle (in Ptolemy) or of the annual orb (in Tycho and Copernicus) to the orb of Mars was as 100,000 to 151,900. ['100,000']\n",
      "Hence, where the semidiameter of the sun's orb (or the earth's) is 100,000, Mars's eccentricity will be 30,380 (Ptolemy book 10 Ch. ['30,380']\n",
      "By supposition, AB is 4153, while AC is 30,380 of the same units. ['30,380']\n",
      "I discovered this above by transposition of the Tychonic value, 18,342, with one change: for the size of Mars's orbit, instead of 151,386 I took 152,500, which is nearer the truth. ['151,386']\n",
      "Now since 21° Leo is about 8° from the aphelion, the line AD will be about 150 parts longer at aphelion (as will be clear to anyone who computes the distances from the hypothesis we have found and substitutes these numbers); that is, either 163,150 or 167,350. ['163,150']\n",
      "And since 12° Pisces is about 13° from the perihelion, AE when right at the perihelion will be about 300 parts shorter; that is, either 139,000 or 137,080. ['139,000']\n",
      "Thus, as 151,075 is to 100,000, so is 12,075 to 8000,\n",

      "5 above, 12,600 was taken from the Brahean revision, and 12,352 in the Ptolemaic equant, where the whole eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or 19,763. ['12,600']\n",
      "Now if, on the other hand, we bisect the eccentricity of 18,564 that we found, we shall indeed represent the acronychal positions near the middle longitudes on the eccentric accurately enough, but not so well the positions around the octants and towards the apsides. ['18,564']\n",
      "The tangent of this is about 945,500, which, multiplied by the perihelial distance of 90,718 and in turn divided by the aphelial distance of 109,282, gives a tangent of 784,880, whose arc is 82° 44' 20\". ['90,718']\n",
      "But CA, the distance of the sun from the earth, is 99,302 from Tycho's table. ['99,302']\n",
      "Therefore, AB is between 165,680 and 166,846. ['165,680']\n",
      "Therefore, AD is between 140,080 and 136,409. ['140,080']\n",
      "But  since the star Mars is 2⅔ degrees from perihelion, AD will be shorter by about 15 at the perihelion itself, that is, between 140,065 and 136,394. ['140,065']\n",
      "Consequently, this eccentricity will be much less than 10,106, and would in fact be 8377 if the sun's distances were correctly given as 99,302 and 102,689, which the requirements of this demonstration leads us to take as 100,000 and 100,000. ['99,302']\n",
      "Now, as above, let AC be 18,564 where CQ is 100,000. ['18,564']\n",

      "Therefore, the ratio of DB to BC (the radius to the eccentricity, which is being sought) is the same as 62,237 to 1143. ['62,237']\n",
      "And as 62,237 is to 100,000 so is 1143 to 1837. ['62,237']\n",
      "Now as the sine of αθκ is to ακ, which we shall say is 100,000 units, so is [the sine of] θκα to θα, which is what is sought. ['100,000']\n",

      "And because βαζ is right, and ζβ is 100,000 (that is, the whole sine), therefore αβ is the sine of the angle αζβ. ['100,000']\n",
      "Therefore, beginning with either the mean or the equated anomaly, either  one going into its proper respective column as use will dictate; or, where it exceeds a semicircle, beginning with the full-circle complement of either of these; you find the requisite distance of the sun from the earth, in units of which the radius of the orb is 100,000 and the eccentricity is 1800. ['100,000']\n",
      "But  the area of a circle of radius 100,000 (from the most recent investigations of Adrian Romanus, a most expert geometer)2 is 31,415,926,536, with no error in even the last digit. ['100,000']\n",
      "Now, in Chapter 26, the distance of Mars from the center of the sun was found to be 147,750 in 14° 21' 7\" Taurus, at the node, on 1595 October 25. ['147,750']\n",
      "Again, in Chapter 27, the distance of Mars was found to be somewhat less than 163,100 at 5° 25' 20\" Libra, and that was on 1590 December 31. ['163,100']\n",
      "Thirdly, in Chapter 28 the distance of Mars was found to be 166,180 at 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, on 1590 October 31, 68 degrees from the node. ['166,180']\n",
      "Now, in triangle ηακ, the angle with its sides again being given, κηα is found to be 78° 44' 1\", and through this, κη [is found to be] 77,187 where ηα is 163,100. ['77,187']\n",
      "Therefore, in the units of which κη formerly was 50,868 and ηγ was 100,000, ηα becomes 107,486. ['50,868']\n",

      "And in the following chapter, [the ratio] will be found with greatest certainty to be that which 100,000 has to 152,640, approximately; eccentricity 9264, where the radius is 100,000. ['100,000']\n",
      "But as 100,000 is to 138,430, so is this 49 to 68. ['100,000']\n",

      "Now as the area of the circle, 31,415,926,536, is to 360 degrees or 1,296,000 seconds, so is this area just found, 463,200,000, to 19,108\", or 5° 18' 28\", the physical part of the equation. ['1,296,000']\n",
      "Therefore, if all our remaining excesses (other than the greatest, 432) were [to the greatest]3 as [all] the sines in one semicircle are to the semidiameter, then as 100,000 is to the sum of the secant and the tangent of 89° (that is, 11,458,869), so,  approximately, would 432 be to 49,934, the approximate sum of all the excesses at integral degrees of the semicircle ^4. ['100,000']\n",
      "And because one distance of 100,000 has the value of 60', this little sum has a value of no more than 4⅕’7 which is nonetheless spread all around the circumference, so that about 45° and 135°, where it is greatest, this tiny error turns out to be imperceptible even in Mars. ['100,000']\n",
      "This multiplied by half the eccentricity αβ, 4632, gives 463,200,000 as the area θβα. ['463,200,000']\n",
      "Therefore, the shorter semidiameter Dβ will be 99,142, which is to 100,000 as 9264 is to 9344. ['100,000']\n",
      "And because BC is 70,711, Cβ, the sine of its complement, will also be 70,711 at this location. ['70,711']\n",
      "And because, as before, the sine 70,711 is shortened in order to constitute a line of the ellipse that is applied ordinatewise11 becoming 70,104, this is now to be combined with the sine of the complement of 135°, which is 70,711, now not increased by the eccentricity αβ, as before, but decreased by it, making it 61,447. ['70,711']\n",
      "Thus, as this is to 100,000, so is 70,104 to the tangent of the required angle, 48° 45' 55\", or its supplement 131° 14' 5\". ['70,104']\n",
      "Next, as 100,000 is to 99,571, so almost exactly will the circumference of the circle be to the circumference of the oval, which is sought. ['100,000']\n",
      "Therefore, as each of the distances, in order, is to the distance 100,210, so is the arc of this distance 100,210 (60’) to the arcs belonging to the other distances. ['100,210']\n",
      "The mean between the two sums, 4,867,852, I reduced to degrees, where 35,924,252 have the value 360°, or 99,790 have the value 1°. ['35,924,252']\n",
      "The reason for its coming out greater than 36,000,000 you have in Ch. ['36,000,000']\n",
      "And if OM is assumed to be 154,200 in the earlier observation, it ought to be taken as shorter in the later one. ['154,200']\n",
      "So let it be 154,400 in the first instance, and in the second, 154,368. ['154,400']\n",
      "And previously, at this distance from aphelion it was found to be approximately 154,400 from the sun. ['154,400']\n",
      "Therefore, a distance of 153,753 is called forth from these. ['153,753']\n",
      "But at this place on the eccentric for one degree about 220 units are owed from the distance, or for the entire angular difference, 317, so that this place, if we carry it back to an anomaly similar to the preceding, has a distance of 158,111 rather precisely. ['158,111']\n",
      "So from the analogy of this  observation with the previous one, at a similar anomaly, a distance of 158,217 is appropriate, where again about the same amount as before, or a little more, is to be added for the latitude. ['158,217']\n",
      "There I derived a distance somewhat less than 163,100 using the equation of the observations, but from the bare observations themselves I obtained 162,818, in the plane of the ecliptic as before. ['163,100']\n",
      "So the distance which was less than 163,13729 at an anomaly of  43° 48' will again be increased at anomaly 43° 24' according to this ratio, so as to make it almost exactly 163,100 in this semicircle. ['163,100']\n",

      "But since 12° 10' Sagittarius is about 26½’ from the node, the secant of the inclination at this place exceeds the radius by about 11 units, or 15 or 16 in our dimensions, so as to make the distance of Mars from the sun almost exactly 147,820 or 147,700. ['147,820']\n",
      "For a similar distance from aphelion in the other semicircle, we shall take  up again the observations of Chapter 26, where I derived a distance of Mars from the sun of about 147,443 or 147,700 or 147,750. ['147,443']\n",
