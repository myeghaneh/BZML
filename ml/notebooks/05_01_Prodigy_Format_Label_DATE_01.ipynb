      "On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3° 30’ Cancer, and again at 4° 1’ Cancer, the mean being 3° 45½’ Cancer ^16. 1597 December 10\n",
      "On 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars is placed at 27° 15’ Sagittarius ^11. 1591 June 6\n",
      "On 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m they established the position of Mars very carefully at 3° 58' 21\" Scorpio, and corrected for longitudinal parallax so as to make it 3° 57’ 11” ^10. 1589 April 15\n",
      "On 1587 March 7 at 19h 10m they deduced the position of Mars from the observations, which was 25° 10’ 20” Virgo. 1587 March 7\n",

      "On 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m,1 they set Mars down at 8° 36’ 50” Gemini2 without mentioning the horizontal variations,  by which term I wish the diurnal parallaxes and the refractions to be understood in what follows. 1580 November 12\n",
      "On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21° 18’ 11” Leo ^8. 1585 January 31\n",
      "On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23° 29’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51°. 1583 January 16\n",
      "But on March 3, with the Mouth of Leo44 culminating, the distance was 29° 15’, and with the Heart of Scorpius45 culminating, 29° 19’ plus. March 3\n",
      "On the night between Thursday and Friday, which was February 17/27, while Corvus was on the meridian, there was 9° 44’ between Mars and Spica, and between it and the Northern Pan,23 17° 41’; and between Mars and Arcturus, 29° 13’.  February 17\n",
      "On February 22 or March 3 we tested the sextant, just as we had done above, and found 26° 2’ between Canis Minor and Orion’s higher shoulder,33 which the calculation shows to be 26° 2’ 15”.  February 22\n",
      "It became clear again on the morning of March 4, and now, when Antares culminated, with the arm fixed at 29° 19’, both stars were seen evenly [with the sights]. March 4\n",
      "On February 19/29 we had moved the sight, and began to observe Mars rising.  February 19\n",
      "On the night following February 29 or March 10, the instrument having meanwhile been displaced, this distance was, first, between 29° 9’ and 29° 10’, half an hour before the culmination of the Heart of Hydra ^37.  February 29\n",
      "Counting backwards 687 days, the number of days in Mars’s revolution on its eccentric, starting from noon on 28 October, the end will fall on 1593 December 10, while on the preceding night Mars was observed near the node. 1593 December 10\n",
      "This will end up at 1592 January 23, when the planet was observed right at the node. 1592 January 23\n",
      "If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh. 1590 March 7\n",
      "On 1595 October 27 at 12h 20m, Mars's true latitude after the removal of parallax was 0° 2’ 20” south ^8. 1595 October 27\n",
      "On the evening of 1593 December 10, Mars was observed at the ascending node. 1593 December 10\n",
      "On 1592 January 23 at 10h 15m in the evening, Mars was at 11° 34’ 30” Aries with latitude 0° 2’ south ^3. 1592 January 23\n",

      "On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m in the evening, Mars's declination was 9° 26’ 1590 March 4\n",
      "I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8°, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0° 3’ 46” N, and it was itself at 13° 36’ 40” Sagittarius ^11. 1595 January 4\n",
      "Whether you do this with the help of the Prutenic or Tychonic tables, taking into account the true precession of the equinox, you will find that on the morning of 1594 December 30, the mean position of Mars is 27° 14½’ Scorpio, and on the morning of 1595 October 28 it was at 5° 31’ Taurus. 1594 December 30\n",
      "On the night of 1589 April 15 Mars's observed latitude was 1° 7’ north ^14. 1589 April 15\n",
      "And thus, although on May 6 it decreased somewhat more slowly, since the star was moving away from the earth, we shall still not be far wrong if we extrapolate proportionally: we make 21 days be to the number of days after which Mars falls upon the ecliptic, as 60 minutes of diminution is to the 6⅔ minutes remaining. May 6\n",
      "This rule shows it to be two and one third days, so that Mars was at the node on May 9. May 9\n",
      "Once again, counting thrice 687 days thence, we will come out on 1594 December 30. 1594 December 30\n",
      "Nor should it disturb you that in 1589 we assigned a latitudinal motion of 6⅔’ to 2⅓ days, while we do not allow so much over a 5-day period around 1595 January 4. 1595 January 4\n",
      "Likewise, at 8h in the evening on 1596 March 9, it was observed at 15° 49’ Gemini, with latitude 1° 49⅔’ north ^14. 1596 March 9\n",
      "On 1589 September 15 at 7¼h in the evening, Mars was observed at 16° 47⅓’ Sagittarius with 1° 41⅔’ southern latitude ^15. 1589 September 15\n",
      "On November 1 following, at 6⅙h, it was seen at 20° 59¼ Capricorn, with latitude 1° 36’ south, the sun being at 19° Scorpio ^16. November 1\n",
      "Therefore, the maximum inclination is much greater than 1° 36’, and by all indications is about as great as the apparent latitude on September 15, namely, 1° 50’, approximately. September 15\n",
      "The first such day fell on 1583 April 22, which only just now I had under consideration. 1583 April 22\n",
      "On 1584 October 30, there was a select occasion, but no observation is available. 1584 October 30\n",
      "However, on November 12 following, at 1½h in the night, when the sun had already fallen about 14° or 15° below the diameter of intersection, the earth having risen that much (for Copernicus), or the diameter of intersection having fallen that much toward the earth (for Tycho), Mars was seen at 23° 14’ Leo with latitude 2° 12⅖’ north, while the sun was at 1° Sagittarius ^17. November 12\n",
      "Similarly, near the other limit, on 1591 October 16 at 6h 30m in the evening, Mars was seen at 1° 27⅓’ Aquarius with latitude 2° 10⅚’ south, decreasing ^19. 1591 October 16\n",
      "(For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2° 18⅔’,20 and on October 2 it was 2° 38½‘.) October 10\n",
      "For example, in the observation of 1585 April 26, the sun was at 16° Taurus, and Mars was observed at 21° 26’ Leo, with latitude 1° 49¾’. 1585 April 26\n",
      "For example, on 1593 August 24, the apparent latitude at opposition to the sun comes out to be 6° 3’ south ^24. 1593 August 24\n",
      "On the other hand, on 1583 April 22, at 9¾h in the night, an interval of 20° 58’ was observed between Mars and the Dog12 and 22° 47½’ between Mars and Cor Leonis ^13. 1583 April 22\n",
      "On 1585 April 26 at 9h 42m, Mars was seen at 21° 26’ Leo with latitude 1° 49¾’ north ^18. 1585 April 26\n",
      "Similarly, on 1586 October 22 at 6h in the morning, about dawn, there was about 6° 9’ eastward between Mars and Cor Leonis ^6. 1586 October 22\n",
      "But on November 2 at 4⅔h in the morning, with the sun at 19⅖° Scorpio, Mars was seen at 5° 52’ Virgo, with latitude 1° 47’ N ^9. November 2\n",
      "Accordingly, on 1588 November 10 at 6h 30m in the morning the planet Mars was seen at 25° 31’ Virgo, with a latitude of 1° 36’ 45” north, the sun being at 21 Scorpio ^4. 1588 November 10\n",
      "On the night following 1582 December 28, at 11h 30m, Mars was observed at 16° 47’ Cancer,6 while the true position of the sun was 17° 13’ 45“ Capricorn. 1582 December 28\n",
      "On the night following 1587 March 4, at 1h 16m past midnight, the position of Mars was found to be 26° 26’ 17“ Virgo,8 from Cor Leonis9 and Spica Virginis, with an observed latitude of 3° 38’ 16“ north. 1587 March 4\n",
      "Therefore, the time of true opposition was March 6 at 7h 23m. March 6\n",
      "On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3° 58’ 20“ Scorpio,13 with latitude 1° 4’ 20“ north, decreasing. 1589 April 15\n",
      "Mars’s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22’ 8“; the sun’s, 58’ 10“; the sum, 1° 20’ 18“. April 13\n",
      "Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. April 14\n",
      "On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27° 14’ 42“ Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3° 55½’ south. 1591 June 6\n",
      "The sun’s diurnal motion was 57’ 8“, and Mars’s (for four days) was 1° 12’ 24“, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26° 2’ 18“ Sagittarius. June 10\n",
      "On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12° 38’ Pisces,18 with latitude 6° 5’ 30“ south. 1593 August 24\n",
      "On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11° 15’ 24“ Pisces, with latitude 5° 52’ 15“ south. August 29\n",
      "For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. August 10\n",
      "The sun’s position on August 24 at 10½h was 11° 2’ 31“ Virgo. August 24\n",
      "until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. August 26\n",
      "On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17° 47’ 15“ Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. 1595 October 30\n",
      "Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. October 31\n",
      "Let, at any rate, Mars’s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3° 45½’ Cancer (as above) ^20. 1597 December 10\n",
      "X. On 1600 January 13/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10° 38’ 46“ Leo ^21. 1600 January 13\n",
      "On February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet’s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.  February 16\n",
      "On the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).  February 23\n",
      "Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3° 0’: 180 minutes in 187 hours.  February 15\n",
      "And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.  February 16\n",
      "Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. March 29\n",
      "For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. April 8\n",
      "Suppose, however, that on 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m Mars was observed at 8° 37’ Gemini,3 and the motion over five days was 1° 55’. 1580 November 12\n",
      "Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m. November 18\n",
      "On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was observed at 21° 18’ 11“ Leo ^7. 1585 January 31\n",
      "Therefore, from 1587 March 6 to 1591 June 8 is 4 years 3 months, to which corresponds a motion of precession of 3’ 37“. 1587 March 6\n",
      "Similarly, from 1587 March 6 to 1593 August 25 is 6 years 5½ months, to which corresponds a motion of  precession of 5’ 30“. 1587 March 6\n",
      "Finally, from 1587 March 6 to 1595 October 31 is nearly 8 years 7 months, to which corresponds a motion of 7’ 18“. 1587 March 6\n",
      "On 1600 March 5, Mars's mean longitude was, in Tycho's reckoning, 4s 29° 11' 3\", apogee 23° 41' Leo. 1600 March 5\n",
      "At perigee, on 1593 July 30, since (in Brahe's reckoning) Mars's [mean] longitude was 10s 26° 12' 43\" and the apogee was at 23° 34' Leo, the simple anomaly was 182° 38' 43\", which requires an equation of 35' 52\", to be added. 1593 July 30\n",
      "At perihelion, let the observation be taken that was made on the night following 1593 July 30 at 1h 45m ^3. 1593 July 30\n",
      "On 1600 March 5/15 about midnight, Mars was observed at 29° 12½' Cancer with latitude 3° 23' north. 1600 March 5\n",
      "I next turned to the interval of six years, and found at length that from 1585 May 18 and 1591 January 22 suitable observations exist. 1585 May 18\n",
      "For they corresponded to 1585 May 30 at 5h and 1591 January 20 at 0h ^5. 1585 May 30\n",
      "Now to the observations: on 1585 May 18 at 10½h at night Mars was observed at 0° 50' 45\" Virgo with latitude 1° 19' 30\" north ^6. 1585 May 18\n",
      "For consider that on April 18 preceding at 10h Mars was found at 17° 37½’ Leo, while Magini puts it at 18° 0' Leo. April 18\n",
      "Over the 33 days elapsed to May 18 this difference was diminished to the measure of 14¼’ . May 18\n",
      "Therefore, on May 30 the difference will be 11¼’. May 30\n",
      "Similarly, on 1591 January 22 at 7h in the morning, Mars was 34° 32' 45\" from Spica with declination 17° 25' south, at an altitude of 16° ^8. 1591 January 22\n",
      "It was observed on October 27 at 12h 20m at 18° 52’ 15\" Taurus, retrograde ^7. October 27\n",
      "Let the first time be 1590 March 5 at 7h 10m in the evening, since then Mars had hardly any latitude, and thus no one looking at the demonstration could be troubled by any irrelevant suspicions about the intermingling of latitude. 1590 March 5\n",
      "And on 1595 October 25 at 5h 45m that line is found at 14° 19' 52\" Taurus. 1595 October 25\n",
      "On 1595 October 25 at 8h 10m, the planet's distance from three fixed stars was observed, and by unanimous consensus the planet was found to be at 19° 39' 25\" [Taurus] with latitude 0° 12' 41\" S. 1595 October 25\n",
      "On 1593 December 7 at 8h 0m Mars was found at 3° 6' 50\" Aries with no danger of horizontal variation, with latitude 7’ 9\" S. However, the right ascension found using three stars showed a discrepancy of 4', and the value taken as true was the mean between the extremes. 1593 December 7\n",
      "On 1592 January 23 at 7h 20m, using only one stellar distance from Mars, without the confirmation of another, Mars was found at 11° 32' 44\" Aries with latitude 0° 1' 36\" S. And so we shall make no changes for horizontal variations, although we suspect an uncertainty of one or two minutes. 1592 January 23\n",
      "We shall now go through the observations1 again, carefully: On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m, Mars was found by careful observation and calculation to be at 24° 22' 56\" Aries with latitude 0° 3' 20\" S. At that time, 8° Aries was setting, so Mars was rather low. 1590 March 4\n",
      "This supposition also agrees with my observations of 1604 February 29/ March 10, for on the night following that day with my instruments I found Mars culminating at 26° 18⅘‘ Libra. 1604 February 29\n",
      "Summary: On 1590 October 31 at 6¼h in the morning, Mars's eccentric position was 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, while the hypothesis constructed using acronychal observations places it at 8° 19' 29\" Virgo. 1590 October 31\n",
      "The aphelion for 1590 October 31 was found in Ch. 1590 October 31\n",
      "Thirdly, in Chapter 28 the distance of Mars was found to be 166,180 at 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, on 1590 October 31, 68 degrees from the node. 1590 October 31\n",
      "Now, in Chapter 26, the distance of Mars from the center of the sun was found to be 147,750 in 14° 21' 7\" Taurus, at the node, on 1595 October 25. 1595 October 25\n",
      "Again, in Chapter 27, the distance of Mars was found to be somewhat less than 163,100 at 5° 25' 20\" Libra, and that was on 1590 December 31. 1590 December 31\n",
      "On 1588 November 10, at 6h 30m in the morning there was 31° 27' between Mars and Cor Leonis. 1588 November 10\n",
      "On 1588 November 10 the observation is 39 minutes less than the midday position of Magini. 1588 November 10\n",
      "[IV] On 1590 October 6, at 4h 45m in the morning, Mars was observed at an altitude of 12½ degrees, [and distances taken] from the Tail of Leo7 and the Heart of Hydra,8 with its declination. 1590 October 6\n",
      "[V] On 1600 March 5/15 at 8½h pm Mars was at 29° 12½’ Cancer, latitude 3° 23' N. And on March 6/16 at 8½h at 29° 18' Cancer, lat. 1600 March 5\n",
      "]3 And on 1587 January 1 at 7h 8m in the morning, at 1° 4' 36\" Libra, Lat. 1587 January 1\n",
      "On 1585 February 17 at 10h the planet was seen at 15° 12½ Leo, with latitude 4° 16' North ^1. 1585 February 17\n",
      "On 1586 December 27 at 4h in the morning, at 29° 42⅔‘ Virgo, lat. 1586 December 27\n",
      "On 1593 July 31 at l¾h am at 17° 39½' Pisces, lat. 1593 July 31\n",
      "6° 6¼’ south,19 and August 11 at 1¾h am at 16° 7½' Pisces, Lat. August 11\n",
      "From 1588 November 22 at 9h 2½m to 1589 November 1 at 6h 10m are 344 days diminished by 2h 52½m while a whole revolution to the same fixed star has 687 days diminished by 0h 28 min. 1588 November 22\n",
      "With all three observations taken into account, let the position of the line αθ on 1589 November 1 at 6⅙h pm be taken as 29° 54' 53\" Aquarius, so that in 1591 it would be 29° 56' 30\", and in 1593, 29° 58' 6\" Aquarius. 1589 November 1\n",
      "And on midnight of July 30 the position of Mars disagrees with Magini's midday position by 3° 25½’, and on August 10 by 3° 59½’,so that the difference is increased, but gradually less so. July 30\n",
      "Therefore, I have assumed a difference of 3° 46' for August 6, so that at 11 hours after midnight it would be at 16° 52' Pisces. August 6\n",
      "4° 16' in 7 days, on September 19 at 7⅙h Mars will be at 14° 20' Capricorn, and at 6⅙h it will be at 14° 18½’ Capricorn. September 19\n",
      "About the station on July 16 or 17, Mars  was about 1° 16' farther forward in the calculation than in Magini. July 16\n",
      "Now, on September 26, it is still 0° 53' farther forward. September 26\n",
      "So if we interpolate, this difference will be about 2 minutes greater on September 19. September 19\n",
      "But previously and in like manner we took at αι 1588 November 22 at 9h 2½m to be 29° 20' 12\" Leo. 1588 November 22\n",
      "And at one of the times noted therein, namely, 1590 March 4 at 7⅕h, the [mean] longitude of Mars was 1s 4° 11' 20\". 1590 March 4\n",
      "On 1585 January 24 at 9h, when the position of the sun was 15° 9' 5\" Aquarius, its distance from earth 98,590, the mean longitude of Mars 4s 16° 50' 10\", the aphelion 4s 28° 46' 41\", the remainder of the mean anomaly to complete the full circle 11° 56' 31\", and the consequent eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 18° 49' 0\" Leo: the planet was observed at 24° 9' 30\" Leo, latitude 4° 31' 0\" N ^30. 1585 January 24\n",

      "In 1591 on the night following May 13, at 1 hour 40m past midnight, when the sun was at 2° 8' 43\" Gemini, distant from earth 101,487, while the mean longitude of Mars was 8s 22° 18' 4\", anomaly 113° 24' 4\", equated 103° 15' 48\", consequent eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 12° 9' 48” Sagittarius (or, by analogy with 26 Sagittarius nearby, just now mentioned, 12° 8¾’ May 13\n",
      "For on the night following June 29 in 1593, at 1h 30m after midnight, when the sun was at 17° 25' 42\" Cancer, 101,760 distant from earth, the longitude of Mars 10s 10° 1' 29\", anomaly 161° 5' 29\", and the consequent position of Mars 6° 10' 5\" Aquarius, it was observed at 13° 37' 22\" Pisces, with latitude 4° 37' S ^38. June 29\n",
      "Finally, on 1595 July 22 at 2h 40m am, when the sun was at 7° 59' 52\" Leo, 101,487 distant from earth, Mars's mean longitude 11s 14° 9' 5\", and anomaly 164° 48' 55\", and consequent eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 17° 16' 36\" Pisces: the apparent position of Mars, from the most select observations, was 4° 11' 10\" Taurus, lat. 1595 July 22\n",
      "On 1597 October 30 at 5h am the position of the sun is found to be 16° 38' 8\" Scorpio, distance 98,820. 1597 October 30\n",
      "On 1589 May 6 at 11⅓h Mars was observed at 27° 7⅓’ Libra with latitude  0° 6⅔’ north ^1. 1589 May 6\n",
      "For with this  one just now presented, there is associated another, from 1594 December 28. 1594 December 28\n",
      "And on the following 1595 January 4 it still had 3' of north latitude ^3. 1595 January 4\n",
      "For the sake of consensus, we shall also add an observation of October 1597. October 15\n",
      "Thus Mars was observed last at this place in  November 1580 ^9. November 15\n",
      "On 1597 November 8, Saturday, or October 29, in the morning, Mars was  not yet on the line from the twelfth of Gemini to the fourth ^13. 1597 November 8\n",
      "Now the mean longitude of Mars on the morning of October 29 at 5h (which is an estimate, since I did not write down the time) is found to be 1s 29° 10' 43\". October 29\n",
      "On 1589 April 5 at 11h 33m Mars was observed at 7° 31' 10\" Scorpio with latitude 1° 28' 13\" N ^15. 1589 April 5\n",
      "A suitable observation at a similar longitude on the other semicircle occurred on 1582 November 12 at 6¾h am, when the sun's position was 29° 35' 17\" Scorpio ^21. 1582 November 12\n",
      "On 1596 March 9 at 7h 40m pm, when the sun's position was 29° 31' 24\" 1596 March 9\n",
      "Now, if a longitude that was taken up expresses satisfactorily the observed values for the distances for these four days, it will also express the observed values for the intervening days, namely, November 25, 26, and 27, and December 3, 17, 27, 28, and 29 of 1582, and January 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 22 of 1583. November 25\n",
      "On 1593 December 10, at 7h 0m in the evening, Mars was observed at 4° 44' Aries, with latitude 0° 1' 15\" south, parallax not accounted for ^1. 1593 December 10\n",
      "After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. 1595 October 28\n",
      "And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. 1592 January 23\n",
      "And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. 1590 March 7\n",
      "For while on October 28 at 12h the latitude was 4½’ south, six days later, on the following November 3, at the same time, the latitude was 19' 45\" north ^5. October 28\n",
      "And since on October 28 at 12h its eccentric position was 16° 8⅓’ Taurus,6 and the remaining latitude was 4½’: let this be traversed in one day and one eighth, after which time 37' are added to Mars's position. October 28\n",
      "For since on 1589 May 6 Mars had 6⅔‘ of northern latitude,7 it traversed this in 2⅓ days, according to the proportion of the latitudinal motion of the preceding days, [arriving at the node on] May 8 at 20h at which time its eccentric position is found to be 16° 42' Scorpio. 1589 May 6\n",
      "On 1593 August 25 at 17h 27m, Mars was observed at opposition to the sun at 12° 16' Pisces ^1. 1593 August 25\n",
      "On 1593 July 21 at 14h (in astronomical terms),4 the planet was observed at 17° 45¾' Pisces, with latitude 5° 46¼’ south ^5. 1593 July 21\n",
      "For the northern inclination, at midnight following 1585 January 31, at an altitude of 53°, the latitude of Mars, now decreasing, was 4° 31' north ^9. 1585 January 31\n",
      "So, on August 10 at 13h 45m, Mars's eccentric position on the ecliptic is computed to be 2° 41' 18\" Pisces, the sun was 27° 37' 49\" Leo, the angle at the sun 5° 3' 29\", the angle at the earth 18° 25', and from the calculation Mars was at 16° 3' Pisces, while it was observed at 16° 7' Pisces ^9. August 10\n",
      "But come, let us see whether our calculation gives the observed latitude on August 10. August 10\n",
      "For we are sure of July 21 and August 25 of that year, since the calculation yields the observations upon which it is based ^8. July 21\n",
      "25 or March 6, the northern latitude was a maximum, while opposition followed by an entire month. March 6\n",
      "27 or October 7, in turn, the southern latitude was a maximum, while Mars was between its quintile and sextile aspects to the sun ^4. October 7\n",
      "In the observations of Chapter 12, considered approximately, on 1595 October 28 Mars was considered to have been at the node ^2. 1595 October 28\n",
      "And on the morning of 1589 May 9 we supposed Mars to have been at the other, descending, node ^3. 1589 May 9\n",
      "Nevertheless, I have discovered, using a very lengthy process of induction extending over the 50 years from Aristotle's fifteenth year to the end of his life, that this could not have happened on any other day than the evening of April 4 in the 357th year before the commonly accepted epoch of Christ, when the 21-year-old Aristotle was, as we know from Diogenes Laertius, a student of Eudoxus ^2. April 4\n",
      "In the year of Christ 139 Pharmouthi 9, which is February 23, at sunset at 5h 30m, 3h 30m at Hven, the apparent position of the sun was computed as 3° 3' Pisces; therefore, the mean position was 0° 43' Pisces.  February 23\n",
      "But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12° 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24° 15’ 30\" Leo. 1599 February 23\n",
      "For in the year of Christ 139 May 27 it was at 0° 41' Leo, while Cor Leonis was at 2° 30' Leo. May 27\n",
      "But today, in 1599 May 27, it is at 28° 58' 50\" Leo, while Cor Leonis is at 24° 15' 45\" Leo. 1599 May 27\n",
      "This time corresponds to the common year of Christ 139 May 27. May 27\n",
      "Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11° 18' 30\". May 27\n",
      "But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". 9944 May 27\n",
      "Therefore, the time of opposition is 17 hours 20 minutes before March 29, at 21:43, the time when the observation was made. March 29\n",
