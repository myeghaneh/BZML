      "On February 19/29 we had moved the sight, and began to observe Mars rising. ['February 19']\n",
      "On February 22 or March 3 we tested the sextant, just as we had done above, and found 26° 2’ between Canis Minor and Orion’s higher shoulder,33 which the calculation shows to be 26° 2’ 15”. ['February 22']\n",
      "It became clear again on the morning of March 4, and now, when Antares culminated, with the arm fixed at 29° 19’, both stars were seen evenly [with the sights]. ['March 4']\n",
      "On the night following February 29 or March 10, the instrument having meanwhile been displaced, this distance was, first, between 29° 9’ and 29° 10’, half an hour before the culmination of the Heart of Hydra ^37. ['February 29']\n",

      "If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh. ['1590 March 7']\n",
      "I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8°, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0° 3’ 46” N, and it was itself at 13° 36’ 40” Sagittarius ^11. ['1595 January 4']\n",
      "On the night of 1589 April 15 Mars's observed latitude was 1° 7’ north ^14. ['1589 April 15']\n",
      "And thus, although on May 6 it decreased somewhat more slowly, since the star was moving away from the earth, we shall still not be far wrong if we extrapolate proportionally: we make 21 days be to the number of days after which Mars falls upon the ecliptic, as 60 minutes of diminution is to the 6⅔ minutes remaining. ['May 6']\n",
      "This rule shows it to be two and one third days, so that Mars was at the node on May 9. ['May 9']\n",

      "Nor should it disturb you that in 1589 we assigned a latitudinal motion of 6⅔’ to 2⅓ days, while we do not allow so much over a 5-day period around 1595 January 4. ['1595 January 4']\n",
      "Whether you do this with the help of the Prutenic or Tychonic tables, taking into account the true precession of the equinox, you will find that on the morning of 1594 December 30, the mean position of Mars is 27° 14½’ Scorpio, and on the morning of 1595 October 28 it was at 5° 31’ Taurus. ['1594 December 30']\n",

      "But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. ['December 5']\n",
      "Similarly, on 1586 October 22 at 6h in the morning, about dawn, there was about 6° 9’ eastward between Mars and Cor Leonis ^6. ['1586 October 22']\n",

      "However, on November 12 following, at 1½h in the night, when the sun had already fallen about 14° or 15° below the diameter of intersection, the earth having risen that much (for Copernicus), or the diameter of intersection having fallen that much toward the earth (for Tycho), Mars was seen at 23° 14’ Leo with latitude 2° 12⅖’ north, while the sun was at 1° Sagittarius ^17. ['November 12']\n",
      "On 1585 April 26 at 9h 42m, Mars was seen at 21° 26’ Leo with latitude 1° 49¾’ north ^18. ['1585 April 26']\n",

      "For example, in the observation of 1585 April 26, the sun was at 16° Taurus, and Mars was observed at 21° 26’ Leo, with latitude 1° 49¾’. ['1585 April 26']\n",
      "For example, on 1593 August 24, the apparent latitude at opposition to the sun comes out to be 6° 3’ south ^24. ['1593 August 24']\n",
      "Suppose, however, that on 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m Mars was observed at 8° 37’ Gemini,3 and the motion over five days was 1° 55’. ['1580 November 12']\n",

      "X. On 1600 January 13/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10° 38’ 46“ Leo ^21. ['1600 January 13']\n",

      "On February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet’s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice. ['February 16']\n",
      "On the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it). ['February 23']\n",
      "Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3° 0’: 180 minutes in 187 hours. ['February 15']\n",
      "And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23. ['February 16']\n",
      "Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. ['March 29']\n",
      "For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. ['April 8']\n",

      "I next turned to the interval of six years, and found at length that from 1585 May 18 and 1591 January 22 suitable observations exist. ['1585 May 18']\n",
      "For they corresponded to 1585 May 30 at 5h and 1591 January 20 at 0h ^5. ['1585 May 30']\n",
      "Now to the observations: on 1585 May 18 at 10½h at night Mars was observed at 0° 50' 45\" Virgo with latitude 1° 19' 30\" north ^6. ['1585 May 18']\n",
      "For consider that on April 18 preceding at 10h Mars was found at 17° 37½’ Leo, while Magini puts it at 18° 0' Leo. ['April 18']\n",
      "Over the 33 days elapsed to May 18 this difference was diminished to the measure of 14¼’ . ['May 18']\n",

      "Therefore, the remainder is the position of Mars on January 20 at 0h (which, as we said, corresponds to the other time): 21° 34' Scorpio. ['January 20']\n",
      "Let the first time be 1590 March 5 at 7h 10m in the evening, since then Mars had hardly any latitude, and thus no one looking at the demonstration could be troubled by any irrelevant suspicions about the intermingling of latitude. ['1590 March 5']\n",
      "It was observed on January 23 at 7h 15m at 11° 34½’ Aries, with the correction for parallax ^5. ['January 23']\n",
      "It was observed December 10 at 7h 20m at 4° 45' Aries, parallax corrected ^6. ['December 10']\n",
      "Therefore, on December 8 at 7h 20m it was seen at 3° 37’ Aries, while at our time of 6h 12m it was at 3° 35½’ Aries. ['December 8']\n",
      "It was observed on October 27 at 12h 20m at 18° 52’ 15\" Taurus, retrograde ^7. ['October 27']\n",
      "We shall now go through the observations1 again, carefully: On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m, Mars was found by careful observation and calculation to be at 24° 22' 56\" Aries with latitude 0° 3' 20\" S. At that time, 8° Aries was setting, so Mars was rather low. ['1590 March 4']\n",
      "On 1592 January 23 at 7h 20m, using only one stellar distance from Mars, without the confirmation of another, Mars was found at 11° 32' 44\" Aries with latitude 0° 1' 36\" S. And so we shall make no changes for horizontal variations, although we suspect an uncertainty of one or two minutes. ['1592 January 23']\n",
      "On 1593 December 7 at 8h 0m Mars was found at 3° 6' 50\" Aries with no danger of horizontal variation, with latitude 7’ 9\" S. However, the right ascension found using three stars showed a discrepancy of 4', and the value taken as true was the mean between the extremes. ['1593 December 7']\n",
      "On 1595 October 25 at 8h 10m, the planet's distance from three fixed stars was observed, and by unanimous consensus the planet was found to be at 19° 39' 25\" [Taurus] with latitude 0° 12' 41\" S. ['1595 October 25']\n",
      "And on 1595 October 25 at 5h 45m that line is found at 14° 19' 52\" Taurus. ['1595 October 25']\n",

      "Summary: On 1590 October 31 at 6¼h in the morning, Mars's eccentric position was 8° 19' 20\" Virgo, while the hypothesis constructed using acronychal observations places it at 8° 19' 29\" Virgo. ['1590 October 31']\n",

      "Nevertheless, I have discovered, using a very lengthy process of induction extending over the 50 years from Aristotle's fifteenth year to the end of his life, that this could not have happened on any other day than the evening of April 4 in the 357th year before the commonly accepted epoch of Christ, when the 21-year-old Aristotle was, as we know from Diogenes Laertius, a student of Eudoxus ^2.

      "But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". ['9944 May 27']\n",
      "For in the year of Christ 139 May 27 it was at 0° 41' Leo, while Cor Leonis was at 2° 30' Leo. ['May 27']\n",

      "But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12° 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24° 15’ 30\" Leo. ['1599 February 23']\n",
