Ptolemy chose the mean motion, thinking that the difference (if any) between taking the mean sun and the apparent sun could not be perceived in the observations, but that the form of computation and of the proofs would become free from difficulty if the sun's mean motion were taken. Copernicus and Tycho followed Ptolemy, carrying over his assumptions. I, as you see in Ch. 15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum, instead establish the apparent position, the true body of the sun, as my reference point, and will vindicate that position with proofs in Parts 4 and 5 of this work.   \n",
