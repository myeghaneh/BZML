      "On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16° 47’ Cancer by observation ^6. ['11h 30m']\n",

      "The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. ['19h 35m']\n",
      "On 1587 March 7 at 19h 10m they deduced the position of Mars from the observations, which was 25° 10’ 20” Virgo. ['19h 10m']\n",
      "This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. ['17h 22m']\n",
      "The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. ['1h 48m']\n",
      "On 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m they established the position of Mars very carefully at 3° 58' 21\" Scorpio, and corrected for longitudinal parallax so as to make it 3° 57’ 11” ^10. ['12h 5m']\n",
      "There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. ['1h 30m']\n",
      "On 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars is placed at 27° 15’ Sagittarius ^11. ['12h 20m']\n",
      "There remained 2 days 4 hours and 5 minutes until the designated moment. ['4 hours and 5 minutes']\n",

      "On 1593 24 August at 10h 30m they report Mars as being at 12° 38’ Pisces12 with an observed diurnal motion of 16’ 45”, and this near the nonagesimal13 where there is no longitudinal parallax. ['10h 30m']\n",
      "The moment designated for the opposition preceded this by 8h 17m (for it was at 2h 13m),14 to which corresponds a motion of 5’ 48” eastward. ['8h 17m']\n",
      "On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, they found Mars at 17° 48’ Taurus, with a diurnal motion of 22’ 54” ^15. ['8h 20m']\n",

      "On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3° 30’ Cancer, and again at 4° 1’ Cancer, the mean being 3° 45½’ Cancer ^16. ['8h 30m']\n",
      "The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1° 15’ westward. ['5h 5m']\n",
      "On 1600 January 13/2317 at 11h 50m, the right ascension of Mars was: 18 19 ['11h 50m']\n",
      "Hence, Mars is at 10° 38’ 46” Leo, at an adjusted time of 11h 40m reduced to the meridian of Uraniborg. ['11h 40m']\n",
      "This gives a diurnal motion of 23’ 44”, and a position on January 19/29 at 9h 40m of 8° 18’ 45” Leo, just as they put it. ['9h 40m']\n",
      "Then, at 8h 28m, it was 44° 41’ from ['8h 28m']\n",
      "Again, at 7h 15m on the morning of December 27, it was 36° 43’ from Cor Leonis,7 whose latitude is 0° 26½’; hence, its longitude at the end of 1582 is 17° 28⅓’ Cancer, altitude 14° 4’, and thus affected by refraction. ['7h 15m']\n",
      "Therefore, from 8h 28½m in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46½m, it was observed to retrogress 9⅔’. ['8h']\n",
      "For the diurnal motion, on the 29th at 7h 47m, the distance of Mars from the southern foot of Erichthonius8 was 29° 38½’ But on the 30th at 8h 8m the distance from the same star was 29° 13½ ^9. ['7h 47m']\n",

      "For on the night following June 29 in 1593, at 1h 30m after midnight, when the sun was at 17° 25' 42\" Cancer, 101,760 distant from earth, the longitude of Mars 10s 10° 1' 29\", anomaly 161° 5' 29\", and the consequent position of Mars 6° 10' 5\" Aquarius, it was observed at 13° 37' 22\" Pisces, with latitude 4° 37' S ^38. ['1h 30m']\n",
      "On 1593 December 10, at 7h 0m in the evening, Mars was observed at 4° 44' Aries, with latitude 0° 1' 15\" south, parallax not accounted for ^1. ['7h 0m']\n",
      "After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. ['11h 30m']\n",
      "And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. ['10h']\n",
      "And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. ['7h']\n",
      "Let the latitude in 1590 be 1 minute; 1592, 1½’; in 1593, 2½’; in 1595 at 11h, 4½’, as we might allow an error from one source or another of one minute either way. ['11h']\n",
      "For while on October 28 at 12h the latitude was 4½’ south, six days later, on the following November 3, at the same time, the latitude was 19' 45\" north ^5. ['12h']\n",
      "And since on October 28 at 12h its eccentric position was 16° 8⅓’ Taurus,6 and the remaining latitude was 4½’: let this be traversed in one day and one eighth, after which time 37' are added to Mars's position. ['12h']\n",
      "For since on 1589 May 6 Mars had 6⅔‘ of northern latitude,7 it traversed this in 2⅓ days, according to the proportion of the latitudinal motion of the preceding days, [arriving at the node on] May 8 at 20h at which time its eccentric position is found to be 16° 42' Scorpio. ['20h']\n",
      "On 1593 August 25 at 17h 27m, Mars was observed at opposition to the sun at 12° 16' Pisces ^1. ['17h 27m']\n",
      "On 1593 July 21 at 14h (in astronomical terms),4 the planet was observed at 17° 45¾' Pisces, with latitude 5° 46¼’ south ^5. ['14h']\n",
      "But the true opposition was 16 hours 46 minutes previously, at 21° 36⅙‘ Leo ^10. ['16 hours 46 minutes']\n",
      "The eighth without doubt had an erroneous declination, for at that time (8h) Mars was not at the meridian. ['8h']\n",
      "For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4° 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4° 31'. ['16 hours']\n",
      "So, on August 10 at 13h 45m, Mars's eccentric position on the ecliptic is computed to be 2° 41' 18\" Pisces, the sun was 27° 37' 49\" Leo, the angle at the sun 5° 3' 29\", the angle at the earth 18° 25', and from the calculation Mars was at 16° 3' Pisces, while it was observed at 16° 7' Pisces ^9. ['13h 45m']\n",
      "61, Mars arrives at the ascending node one day and 15 hours late. ['15 hours']\n",
      "And since the diurnal motion at 21° Gemini (Cancer, today) is about 23', and that of the sun, 61', and the sum is 1° 24', those 41' therefore require 8 hours,11 at which time Mars was visible at 21° 8' Gemini, opposite the sun's apparent position. ['8 hours']\n",
      "Therefore, a difference of 2° 23' requires 1 day 17 hours 21 minutes, at which time Mars was visible at 29° 31' Leo. ['17 hours 21 minutes']\n",
      "Finally, at 3° Gemini (Cancer, today) Mars's diurnal motion is 23', the sun's 57', the sum 1° 20', by which it is shown that for 7' there are required 2h 6m, at which time Mars was visible at 2° 36' Sagittarius. ['2h 6m']\n",
      "Therefore, for the extra 30' the corresponding times come out almost exactly the same, to be added to all three, namely, about 8 hours 40 minutes. ['8 hours 40 minutes']\n",
      "And the mean motion from the equinox will be increased by the above mentioned 21½’, but it will be 8 hours 40 minutes longer. ['8 hours 40 minutes']\n",
      "Therefore, the first opposition will be 4 hours later,20 and Mars will be the same number of minutes farther back in position, while the last opposition will occur 4⅓ hours earlier,21 with Mars the same number of minutes farther along in position. ['4 hours']\n",
      "The correct and truest opposition therefore follows by 4 hours ^29. ['4 hours']\n",
      "To 8 hours of mean motion correspond 10' 30\", to which add the extra 8 minutes of travel ^35. ['8 hours']\n",
      "Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11° 18' 30\". ['6h']\n",
      "But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". ['6h']\n",
      "In the year of Christ 139 Pharmouthi 9, which is February 23, at sunset at 5h 30m, 3h 30m at Hven, the apparent position of the sun was computed as 3° 3' Pisces; therefore, the mean position was 0° 43' Pisces. ['5h 30m']\n",
      "But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12° 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24° 15’ 30\" Leo. ['3h 30m']\n",
      "For since at Alexandria, the sun at 25° Capricorn rises at 7h, and the morning observation of Mars was made one hour earlier, as dawn was breaking, it was therefore made at the sixth hour, which is the fourth hour at Hven, from which time there are eight hours until noon. ['7h']\n",
      "With the sum of the diurnal motions of Mars and the Sun (1° 21' 14\"), Kepler computed the time it takes for Mars and the Sun to move 58' 38\", that is, about 17 hours 20 minutes. ['17 hours 20 minutes']\n",
      "To find the position of Mars at opposition, Kepler computed the angular distance that Mars and Earth—now substituting the place of the Sun—moved during 17 hours 20 minutes; Mars moved eastward about 16' 20\" and the Sun westward about 42' 18\". ['17 hours 20 minutes']\n",
      "Therefore, the time of opposition is 17 hours 20 minutes before March 29, at 21:43, the time when the observation was made. ['17 hours 20 minutes']\n",
      "Kepler determined the time of opposition on March 28, 4h 23m AM, old style. ['4h 23m']\n"
