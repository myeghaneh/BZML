      "In the descending semicircle, however, from 5 observations, we had found 166,250 or 166,278. ['166,250']\n",
      "So, although the difference is imperceptible, let us nevertheless take the mean, 166,260, giving more trust to the descending semicircle, as it is better confirmed by the observations. ['166,260']\n",
      "Let it thus be [taken as] certain that at a mean anomaly of 11° 52' the distance is 166,260. ['166,260']\n",
      "Hence, however great a hypothetical value you may conceive by some rough method, which is to be confirmed shortly thereafter, it follows that where the radius is 100,000, the distances at aphelion cannot increase more than 164 units, and even less if you use the hypothesis of a perfect circle. ['100,000']\n",
      "42, add about 250, and these added to 166,260 make 166,510. ['166,260']\n",

      "51, at a remaining [mean] anomaly of 161° 45½’, or 161° 30½' after correction, we found the distance, before correction for latitude, to be 139,000 or 138,984. ['139,000']\n",
      "So let 139,000 be at 21 Pisces. ['139,000']\n",
