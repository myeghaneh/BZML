      "Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram. ['circle']\n",
      "In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times. ['circle']\n",
      "There, an eccentric is shown to square accounts with an epicycle on a concentric, provided, that is, that the line of apsides in the eccentric and the line through the center of the epicycle and the planet on the concentric always remain parallel, and that the semidiameter of the epicycle in the latter is equal to the eccentricity in the former, while the semidiameters of eccentric and concentric are equal. ['square']\n",
      "So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet. ['sphere']\n",
      "Now the planet: must execute a perfect circle in the pure aether by its inherent: force, an epicycle in the first model and an eccentric in the second. ['circle']\n",
      "When they are extended by the circular filaments, they relax and open the passage, and constrict it when the filaments return into the form of a smaller circle. ['circle']\n",
      "For a circle is both defined and brought to perfection by the same criterion, namely, equality of distance from the middle. ['circle']\n",
      "No matter how many of these motive faculties you set up, a circle, even for God, is nothing other than what was just said. ['circle']\n",
      "Geometers do, of course, show how, given three points on a circumference, to form a continuous circle, but in this very proof it is presupposed that some portion of the circumference (that which passes through the three points) is already constructed. ['circle']\n",
      "This is possible in no other way than if the planet's mover (as in Avicenna's opinion) imagine for itself the center of its orb and its distance from it, or if it be assisted by providing some other property of a circle in order to lay out its own circle. ['circle']\n",
      "I have presented these models hypothetically, the hypothesis being astronomy's testimony that the planet's path is a perfect eccentric circle such as was described. ['circle']\n",
      "2, the circle IFH will be equal to the circle δζ. ['circle']\n",
      "C will be the point of the equant, that is, the point about which the planet completes equal angles in equal times, even though it lays out the circle around B rather than around C. ['circle']\n",
      "For let a point E be chosen on the circle which the planet is bodily traversing, and let it be connected with C, B, and A. Now let DCE be a right angle, as well as ECF. ['circle']\n",
      "But if the planet's path is a perfect circle, as Ptolemy certainly thought, the planet also has to have some additional perception of the swiftness and slowness by which it is carried along by the other external power, in order to adjust its own approach and recession in such accord with the power's precepts that the path DE itself is made to be a circle. ['circle']\n",
      "It therefore needs both a comprehension of the circle and a desire to effect it. ['circle']\n",
      "For, in Ptolemy, the planet bodily traces out a perfect circle in the aethereal air. ['circle']\n",
      "If from ε, the planet's position at apogee, you extend the distance αβ, the semidiameter of the orb, to θ, and from θ draw θκ parallel to αδ, the circle εκ described about θ will indeed go through ε and the perigeal point opposite, but since it touches the straight line δη only at k, while the planet goes through η, it does not stay on the circle εκ, but strays outside this track. ['circle']\n",
      "To this excursion of the planetary path from the perfection of the circle Ptolemy might well have objected against Copernicus, but I do not. ['circle']\n",
      "For below, in Part IV, it will be demonstrated that by the agency of two physical powers, simple in capability, acting in concert to move the planet, it necessarily happens that the planet turns aside from the circle for a short time, though not by running outside of it, as in this Copernican hypothesis, but in the opposite direction, towards the center; that is, by making an incursion. ['circle']\n",
      "I answer, this is indeed true, but in that case the space of the sphere of the stars intercepted between the two lines is not perceptible to the power of sight unless the distance between the parallels is perceptible in relation to the radius of the sphere of the stars. ['sphere']\n",
      "Again, let the observer or moving power be at some point not on the line ια, and let this be δ. Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about δ be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from δ. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at δ square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered. ['square']\n",
      "Now, when the observer α lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric β and the center of the equant γ on the side of β opposite the center of the equant γ, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position ι. But when the observer departs from this line, as at δ, then a straight line drawn from δ through the center of the circle β marks the place of the optical slowing, η, while the true and physical slowing is at ι. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between ι and η, as would be if a line were to be drawn from δ through γ to the point ζ. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which δβ were the line of apsides of the eccentric and βγ the line of the equant’s eccentricity, then even though the planet’s true path ιη remained the same, it would be represented differently at δ than at α. For to the observer at δ the planet would be slowest at ζ, and to the one at α it would be slowest at ι. But no such thing would be represented at δ that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above. ['circle']\n",
      "Since γ is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line γει indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. ['circle']\n",
      "Once more, two eccentrics or planetary paths through the aethereal air will be described, about Β and θ. All the letters on each circle will be carried over along with them, and the magnitudes of the lines will remain precisely the same. ['circle']\n",
      "Ptolemy said that at a determined point on the planetary circle that serves for the first inequality, there is fixed, not the planet itself, but the center of an epicycle bearing the planet fixed upon its circumference, which is in turn borne by the planet’s chief circle. ['circle']\n",
      "For he says that since the earth is in addition carried along by another motion, which is annual, in a very large circle (which he calls the orbis magnus), those who believe that the earth is at rest think that the planets and the sun are carried in the opposite direction; and he says that when the sun is between the planet and the earth, in the appearance the motions of the earth and the planet in are added, whence the planet appears to be swift; and when, on the other hand, the earth is between the sun and the planet, the planet is apparently left behind and thus retrogresses, owing to the earth’s being swifter than the planet. ['circle']\n",
      "In fact, however, the point of vision is the earth, our home, which is found at one or another point on the circle σγυ at various times. ['circle']\n",
      "This involved finding the magnitude of the planetary circle's eccentricity from the selected point β, and the parts of the zodiac into which the apogee points, by comparing the angles which the observed positions set up about the point of observation β, with the time intervals between them. ['circle']\n",
      "This is because, although θζ precedes the line υω in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if θ, υ, and absolutely all points on the earth’s circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars. ['circle']\n",
      "I say  that ερ subtends a maximum angle of vision when the observer is stationed at the point where a circle drawn through ε and ρ is tangent to the earth’s circle. ['circle']\n",
      "For let such a circle be described through ερ tangent to the circle υσ on the side towards σ, and let the point of tangency be ν. From ε and ρ let lines extend both to the tangent point ν and to several other points of circle υσ before and after the point of contact. ['circle']\n",
      "Now since circles touch one another in one and only one point, the sides of all angles extending from ε and ρ and meeting with points on circle υσ will therefore be cut by the circle through ερ, with the exception of those that terminate at the tangent point of the circles, ν. But the sides from ε and ρ that are cut by the circle ερ before they intersect would form a greater angle had they intersected at either of the points of section,11 by Euclid’s Elements I. ['circle']\n",
      "Next, let a circle passing through ε and ρ touch the circle βυ at point ν, and, ερ being bisected at ο, let ψο be set up perpendicular to ιρ, and βν be extended so as to intersect οψ at ψ. The center of the circle will be ψ. For the center of the circle is on the line passing through the center of one of the tangent circles and the point of tangency, by Euclid III. ['circle']\n",
      "3, the center of the circle is on the perpendicular bisector of the chord ερ, which connects the points of intersection ε and ρ. Therefore, the center is on the line οψ, and hence is at the point ψ common to the two lines. ['circle']\n",
      "Its square will also be a figured unit [x2]. ['square']\n",
      "Add the square on εο, 227,052, and the sum of the two will be the square of ψε or ψν. ['square']\n",
      "But the square of βν is 4,310,747,475. ['square']\n",
      "If you add this to the square of ψν and complete the rectangle, the result will be the square of the whole ψβ. ['square']\n",
      "Then each rectangle is the root of ['rectangle']\n",
      "And thus the square on βψ is obtained for the first time ^17. ['square']\n",
      "Its square will be ['square']\n",
      "Add to this the square of βα, 8,220,686,224, so that the square on βψ may be established for a second time: ['square']\n",
      "And since this is equal to the latter’s root, its square will be equal to the quantity itself. ['square']\n",
      "This square is ['square']\n",
      "Now that the semidiameter of the circle is known, the angles are easily obtained. ['circle']\n",
      "For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth Κ, performed on the circle ΧΖ. ['circle']\n",
      "Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, this will occur at the parts of the epicycle near perigee, therefore when the sun, and the planet with it, are not exactly at perigee but nearby: namely (to put it briefly) at the points Ν and Π corresponding to the same moment of time, such that the small circle through them and Κ is a minimum. ['circle']\n",
      "The center of this small circle is, moreover, on the line through Κ which, extended upward and meeting ΡΔ likewise extended, makes an angle of 7½ degrees. ['circle']\n",
      "Thus the center of the planetary system will be on the circle VP, the sun at S and G, and the body of the planet opposite it at O and F. ['circle']\n",
      "For we have just transposed the point of attachment from the circle VP, upon which Brahe had it move around, to the circle GS, that is, to the body of the sun. ['circle']\n",
      "On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars. ['circle']\n",
      "Since the plane of Mars’s eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit. ['circle']\n",
      "And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planet’s body intersects the ecliptic. ['circle']\n",
      "It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosius’s On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planet’s path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect. ['circle']\n",
      "And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit. ['circle']\n",
      "We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found. ['circle']\n",
      "Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planet’s eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle. ['circle']\n",
      "But from this right ascension, I first select,  from Tycho’s table of right ascensions, the degree of the right sphere that was riding at the same time, 28° 1’ 0” Libra,27 whose declination, from another of that author’s tables,28 is 10° 48’ 30” [South]. ['sphere']\n",
      "Therefore, Mars is distant from the ecliptic, the oblique path, by 3° 0’ 30” on the circle of declination. ['circle']\n",
      "But the angle which the circle of declination makes with the ecliptic is 68° 59’ from the appropriate table. ['circle']\n",
      "When one third of the distance between Mars and Spica had crossed the meridian, it [i.e., the distance to Arcturus] first appeared to us to be 29° 9½’, but the cylinder was not well enough applied, as it was too long. ['cylinder']\n",
      "And Mars was see on both sides of the cylinder. ['cylinder']\n",
      "Especially on account of the length of the cylinder. ['cylinder']\n",
      "But proportionally as D or C is less distant from the ecliptic than E, D is closer to A than E, with the result that the distance D may be seen from A as proportionally greater, and both may be seen under the same angle from A. Now, according to spherical trigonometry, as the distance of C from the ecliptic is to the distance of E from the ecliptic, so is the sine of arc CB (that is, AD) to the whole sine AE, because ECB is a circle inclined above AB. ['circle']\n",
      "However, since so great an inequality still remains in the planet’s motion, after the removal of the inequality that depends upon the sun, it therefore will be incapable of being either governed or demonstrated by the supposition of a simple circle (one set up at the center of observation). ['circle']\n",
      "The simplest ways of doing this are two: by using either an eccentric circle or a concentric with an epicycle. ['circle']\n",
      "On this line below B let A be the observer, and above B let C be that center about which angles are made proportional to amounts of time, since (as was just said above) these are not proportional about A. Now let F, G, D, and E be four observations distributed about the circumference of the circle, so situated that the planet, stripped of the second inequality, would appear there as if  viewed from point A. For indeed, according to Ptolemy, A is the true center of vision or the center of the earth, while according to Tycho and Copernicus vision takes place along the lines FA, GA, DA, and EA, and A is the sun ^7. ['circle']\n",
      "It is now required to select values for angles FAH and FCH such that, once these are supposed, the points F, G, D, E stand on one circle, and that center B of that circle lie between the points C and A on the line CA. ['circle']\n",
      "In the same way, since the sidereal position of AH (that is, CH) was arrived at through this assumption of ours, and it passes through C the center of our equant circle (and therefore also through the starting point from which the numbering of its parts has its beginning, namely, the apsis which is conceived as being above H); and since we are also required to assume the angle FCH, the line CF therefore also will acquire its position on the circumference of the equant. ['circle']\n",
      "And in the quadrilateral DEFG (if, indeed, it is inscribed in a circle, which is one of the hypotheses here), it is a consequence that two opposite angles (as GFE, GDE) taken together are equal to the sum of two right angles. ['quadrilateral']\n",
      "When you have carried this out until the angles F and D (and therefore the remaining angles G and E) truly stand upon the same circumference, now, in turn, an enquiry must be made into the other matter that it is fitting to pursue, and that is, whether the center of that circle B lies between C and A on the same line. ['circle']\n",
      "Consequently, the angles at the base will not be unknown, as well as GB the radius of the circle, in proportion to AC, the eccentricity taken at the beginning. ['circle']\n",
      "But if we keep FCH fixed and change FAH we fall into yet another absurdity, namely, that the positions D, E, F, G, do not fall upon  a circle (just as they did not above, before we had finally established the magnitude of FAH). ['circle']\n",

And let this also be posited at the start: that although the earth (sun, or planet) is moved uniformly around γ and thus nonuniformly around β, it nevertheless remains on the circumference of the circle described about β. Now, by the equivalence shown in the second chapter (which, for the sake of avoiding confusion, I shall not apply to the general Ptolemaic hypothesis), this is exactly as if one were to say that the earth (or sun) is moved nonuniformly on a concentric with an epicycle4 about center α, the semidiameter of the epicycle being equal to αβ; and the arcs described on the concentric by the center of the epicycle being similar to the arcs of the epicycle described by the earth (or sun), so that both the earth (or sun) and the center of the epicycle are moved unequally in equal times, so as to become slow, or again speed up, simultaneously.

      "Therefore, beginning with either the mean or the equated anomaly, either  one going into its proper respective column as use will dictate; or, where it exceeds a semicircle, beginning with the full-circle complement of either of these; you find the requisite distance of the sun from the earth, in units of which the radius of the orb is 100,000 and the eccentricity is 1800.

      "For it was 90° that was proposed, which, standing farther down, shows [a distance of] 99,953, while, according to the law of the circle, αζ or αη should be 99,984. ['circle']\n",

      "The power that moves the planet in a circle diminishes with removal from its source. ['circle']\n",
      "Indeed, I now take it as proven that this is the origin of the belief that the centers of these planets' eccentrics move around on a small annual circle. ['circle']\n",
      "In the diagram of Chapter 29, in which α was the center of the world, β was the center of the eccentric δε, and γ was the point of the equant, let the equant circle υφ be described about center γ, with radius equal to βδ. ['circle']\n",
      "So let straight lines be drawn from the center γ through the points ψ and ω, intersecting the equant at χ, τ. Now Ptolemy will say, \"since the whole circle of the equant υφ denotes the periodic time of the planet, then υχ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric ψδ, and φτ is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric εω.\" ['circle']\n",
      "It was demonstrated in the previous chapter that the increments of time of a planet on equal parts of the eccentric circle (or on equal distances in the aethereal air) are in the same ratio to each other as the distances of those same spaces from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned; or, more simply, to the extent that a planet is farther from the point that is taken as the center of the world, it is less strongly urged to move about that point. ['circle']\n",
      "Since the perimeters of similar regular figures, even of circles, are to one another as their semidiameters, therefore as αδ is to αε, so is the circumference of the circle described about α through δ to the circumference of the circle described about the same point α through ε. But as αδ is to αε, so is the strength of the power at ε to the strength of the power at δ, inversely, by what was proved in Chapter 32. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, as the circle at δ is to the smaller circle at ε, so, inversely, is the power at ε to the power at δ; that is, the power is weaker to the extent that it is more spread out, and stronger to the extent that it is more concentrated. ['circle']\n",
      "Hence we understand that there is the same power in the whole circumference of the circle through δ as there is in the circumference of the smaller circle through ε. This was shown to be true of light in exactly the same way in the Astronomiae pars optica, Chapter 1 ^4. ['circle']\n",
      "Finally, since there is just as much power in a larger and more distant circle as there is in a smaller and closer one, nothing of this power is lost in travelling from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the movable body. ['circle']\n",
      "It therefore remains that the body of the sun itself rotates in the manner described above, indicating the poles of the zodiac by the  poles of its rotation (by a line extended from the center of the body to the fixed stars through the poles), and indicating the ecliptic by the greatest circle of its body, thus furnishing a natural cause for these astronomical entities. ['circle']\n",
      "Here, by the way, is a marvel: in any given time the center of the moon traverses twice as long a line about the center of the earth as any place on the surface of the earth beneath the great circle of the equator. ['circle']\n",
      "Thus it is credible that there is in the sun no force whatever attracting the planets, as there is in the magnet, (for then they would approach the sun until they were quite joined with it), but only a directing force, and consequently that is has circular fibers all set up in the same direction, which are indicated by the zodiac circle ['circle']\n",
      "It might appear that in order to avoid this as much as possible, God introduced the relative inclinations of all the eccentrics, deviations from the ecliptic, and transpositions of the nodes, as well as the proportions of the bodies and the attenuation of shadows in a cone. ['cone']\n",
      "Next, let δε be any luminous great circle on the body of the sun. ['circle']\n",
      "And the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the circle at the shorter distance (i.e., the angle δβε) is to the apparent magnitude at the greater distance (i.e., the angle δγε), conversely, as the longer distance αγ from such a circular line (which at a distance appears straight) is to the shorter δβ. ['circle']\n",
      "So, since this diameter appears longer from the nearby point β than from the distant point γ, in the same ratio, while the radiation belonging to any given point is denser at a nearby point β than at a distant point γ, it is therefore apparent that the density of radiation of the circle at the nearby point β will have to the density of radiation at the distant point γ the [inverse of the] duplicate ratio of αβ to αγ. ['circle']\n",
      "But since the radiation of the circle δε at γ and β was just proved to be in the duplicate ratio of the distances αβ, αγ, while both are causes of the density [of radiation], it appears that the radiation of the disc, with respect to density or strength, is in the triplicate ratio of the distances αγ, αβ. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, the radiation of the diameter of the circle δε would be 1 at γ and 4 at β. But the discs are in the duplicate ratio of the diameters. ['circle']\n",
      "But the spherical surface was demonstrated by Archimedes to be four times the area of the greatest circle described in the sphere. ['circle']\n",
      "In the second supposition, concerning the circle, and the third, concerning the disc, there are two false assumptions. ['circle']\n",
      "The first is that a mathematical circle, lacking breadth, is supposed to shine. ['circle']\n",
      "For it can no more shine itself than can the point from whose motion the circle is supposed to be generated. ['circle']\n",
      "The physical identity of the circle δε, the surface δαε (when light is in question) and the body δε (when power is in question) remains the same whether it is viewed from γ or from β, and will always act the same and have the same effect, spreading the same amount of power or light in the more diffuse orb γ as in the more compact orb β. Nothing is lost in the journey: the entire species carries through to any distance, however remote. ['circle']\n",
      "Indeed, if I might argue from Euclid's Optics here, less light arrives at the nearer, β, than at the more remote, for the reason that at β a smaller circle bounds the visible hemisphere of the luminous body δε than at γ. Therefore, not so many particles of the sun δε can be seen from β as from γ. But this is quite imperceptible, hard to express [even] in enormous numbers. ['circle']\n",
      "If there is the same amount of light spread out in a large sphere as there is gathered together in a small sphere, there will not be the same amount of power in both places, for power is not considered orbicularly in a sphere as light is, but in the circle in which the planet proceeds. ['sphere']\n",
      "For in light, the  rays do not flow out solely from the individual points and circles of the body to the corresponding points and circles of the sphere. ['sphere']\n",
      "Even though the magnetic filaments of the solar body are ordered according to zodiacal longitude, and even though there is but a single great circle of the sun's body beneath the zodiac or ecliptic, and roughly beneath the orbit of the planet, and (finally) even though the other smaller circles (which are compacted to the size of points beneath the poles) are subordinated to their corresponding circles in the sphere of the planet, nevertheless, the rays from all the filaments of the solar body (standing up from one hemisphere of the body) flow down and converge on the individual points of the path of any of the planets as well as on those poles that are above the poles of the sun's body, and the body of the planet is transported according to the measure of the density of this entire species compounded of all the filaments. ['circle']\n",
      "Thus, even if it were undisturbed by epicycles, the moon itself, even though moving on a circle concentric with the earth, would move around  nonuni ['circle']\n",

      "I have spoken of the origin of the motion which rotates the planets around the sun or the moon around the earth; that is, I have spoken of the natural causes of the circle which in the theories of the planets is called either eccentric or concentric, according to the various intentions of the authors.

      "Let the orbit of the planet be a circle, as has been believed until now, and let it be eccentric with respect to the sun, the source of power. ['circle']\n",
      "If it were possible for the planet to move on a perfect epicycle by its inherent force,1 and for its orbit at the same time to be a perfect circle, then we would have to consider similar arcs to be swept out in the same times, on the eccentric and on the epicycle. ['circle']\n",
      "For let AN be drawn parallel to BD, and let AN be equal to BD, and about center N let an epicycle be described which shall go through D. Now since CD is a perfect circle, the same angles are swept out by the planet D about the center of the eccentric B as by the center of the epicycle N about the center of the sun A (through the equivalence demonstrated in Chapter 2), as long as the diameter of the epicycle ND with the planet at D always remains parallel to AB with respect to its position in the world. ['circle']\n",
      "I do not deny that a center can be conceived, and about it a circle. ['circle']\n",
      "Besides, if the planet were to derive its correct distances from the sun,  ordained by the rule of the circle, from memory, it could also derive from memory the equal arcs of the eccentric which are to be traversed in unequal times, and which are to be traversed by an extrinsic force originating in the sun, as if it were obtaining the values right from the Prutenic or Alphonsine tables. ['circle']\n",
      "But it is all right, because even the observations themselves will not allow CD to be a perfect circle, below in Chapter 44, so these theoretical arguments, weak though they are thought to be, do not stand alone, and are that much the less vulnerable to scornful rejection. ['circle']\n",
      "Consequently, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, then to equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, correspond unequal descents of the planet along the diameter, namely, γι, ιλ, λζ. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, the measure of the planet's descent on the diameter γζ is neither time, nor distance traversed on the eccentric, nor the angle at the sun. ['circle']\n",
      "And as for its involving many absurdities, in Chapter 57 below, a certain physicist will quite readily allow this: that on the testimony of the observations the path of the planet is not a circle. ['circle']\n",

      "So our hypothetical person who says that the planet's path is a perfect circle will say this: that the planet performs its reciprocation so as to make the diameters of the sun, at the end points of equal arcs of the eccentric, appear very nearly*  inversely proportional to the lines δα, εα, ζα, or to ια, λα, ζα, which are equal to them, taken with respect to the longest line γα; and that through this consideration of the diameters of the sun at the chosen moments of time, come the proximities of ι, λ, ζ to γ. ['circle']\n",
      "It should be known, however, that the increases of the diameter of the sun and the arcs of the epicycle do not square with each other well, and so the motive mind will have to have a very good memory in order to adjust the unequal versed sines of the arcs on the epicycle to the equal increases of the solar diameter.

      "And as this the area of the circle is to the 360° of mean anomaly or time (that is, 21,600' or 1,296,000\"), so is the area of the triangle, 90,000,000, to 3713\"; that is, 1° 1' 53\". ['circle']\n",
      "It arises from this: that while Archimedes did indeed divide the circle into an infinity of triangles, they stood upon the circumference at right angles, so that their vertices were at the center of the circle B. But one cannot proceed in the same way with triangles standing upon the circumference with their vertices at A, because the circumference is intersected obliquely by the straight lines from A in all places other than C and D.

      "Now, having seen from the observations that the planet's orbit is not perfectly circular, I immediately succumbed to this great persuasive impetus, believing that from those things which were called absurd in fabricating the circle in Chapter 39, now transmuted into a more probable form, an orbit of the planet that would be both correct and in agreement with the observations would be effected.

      "It is, however, reasonable to suppose that the circle of the equator with its axis and poles would forever decline from the poles of this ecliptic HK by an equal and fixed distance, if the true ecliptic were the world's primary circle. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, the equator appears to maintain a constant inclination to some other circle. ['circle']\n",
      "So a great cause, and a great dignity, ought to belong to this hidden circle. ['circle']\n",
      "And thus from all these plausible arguments there arises a royal circle LOM, middle among the circles of the planets, to which all the planets, and Mars with them, maintain a constant inclination. ['circle']\n",
      "The example of the moon should not trouble us, whose inclination to the ecliptic, but not to any other great circle, is a constant 5°, both in the past and today, even though the ecliptic has been moved. ['circle']\n",
      "The others in common circle the sun, while the moon circles the earth. ['circle']\n",
      "The sun sweeps the others around in a circle, while the earth so moves the moon. ['circle']\n",
      "What wonder, then, if the moon keeps the limits of its latitude constant with respect to the changeable ecliptic HK, beneath which lies the terrestrial circle, while the other planets do so with respect to some other invariable circle, such as LOIM? ['circle']\n",
      "It is therefore granted that Mars's orbit is inclined at a constant angle to some circle that maintains its position beneath the same fixed stars, such as  LOIM. ['circle']\n",
      "This only follows, however, if we grant that the nodes of Mars and the nodes of the earth, that is, the intersections of these orbits with the invisible circle LOIM, are not always carried over the same intervals in the heavens, some being faster than others. ['circle']\n",
      "For since the equator maintains a constant inclination to this invisible circle LOIM, while the ecliptic is meanwhile moved, the declination of the equator from the ecliptic is consequently perceived to be changeable. ['circle']\n",
      "About center A with radius AB of 23° 42' (or thereabouts) let a smaller circle be described, and let B, C be the positions of the north pole of the world, or the points upon which falls a line from the center of the earth's body through the pole of the daily rotation on the same body, B at the time of Ptolemy, and C at our time. ['circle']\n",
      "Thus the circle AD extended will pass through the solstice of the intermediate time. ['circle']\n",
      "Therefore, close to the line AE there would be the pole of the circle beneath which the orbit and circuit of the earth was once arranged. ['circle']\n",
      "And because the northern limit is in Aries, let EA be extended in the direction of A, and let the point I be taken on the extension below A. Thus the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic would be at I. About center A with radius AI let a small circle be described, on which let another point O be taken, nearer to C than I is to B. And let O be the present pole of the ecliptic, 23° 31½’ from C, while I, the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic, is 23° 51½’ from B. This will be the theory of the ecliptic's altered obliquity and of the altered latitude of the fixed stars, except that the size of the small circle OI is not known to us. ['circle']\n",
      "And because O is today's pole of the ecliptic, and OC points towards the beginning of Cancer, let CP be the eighth part of the circle, and P the middle of Leo, where the northern limit of Mars is today. ['circle']\n",
      "Let PO be extended beyond O, and let GI be drawn through I nearly parallel to PO, but slanting somewhat forward in longitude (for the sidereal position of Mars's limit was once a little farther forward than today), and let it be extended beyond I. And about A let a small circle be described, intersecting PO at F and GI at H. Let the size of the circle be sufficient to make OF greater than IH. ['circle']\n",
      "And let the pole of the circle beneath which the circuit of Mars is arranged, be placed at F today, and at H in the past. ['circle']\n",
      "A great inequality in the motion of the nodes must indeed follow if it is true  that the poles of the individual planets circle some common pole in different times. ['circle']\n",
      "Once a beginning is made, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is found through  observation, it is a trivial matter to use the sun's declinations on each day to report its elongation from the point occupied by the sun at the time stated to be the moment of the equinox, whatever it might be or in whichever sphere it might be established. ['sphere']\n",
      "Copernicus, on the other hand, acted ingeniously and wittily (in the common  opinion), and wisely (in mine), in removing his eyes from the heavens and seeking that point in the globe of the earth, above which, in the sphere of the fixed stars, there stands a point, determinate for any age you please, as was said in Ch. ['sphere']\n"
