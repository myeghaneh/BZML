      "Therefore, where εβ is 100,000, αη is 162,818, and thus αε is 100,174. ['100,174']\n",
      "Still, it should be noted that if we suppose that the earth's path is not a perfect circle, but is narrower at the sides, αη comes out here to be a little less than 163,100. ['163,100']\n",
      "Its distance was 166,180, which must be lengthened because of the latitude, so that from this distance, the distance from the actual body of Mars to the center of the sun comes out to be about 166,228. ['166,228']\n",
      "And because βδ is 100,000 and βα 1800, and αβδ is a straight line, by addition of the two the aphelial distance αδ is obtained; and because βε too is 100,000, when αβ is subtracted the perihelial distance αε remains. ['100,000']\n",
      "And because βαζ is right, and ζβ is 100,000 (that is, the whole sine), therefore αβ is the sine of the angle αζβ. ['100,000']\n",
      "Now the maximum equation at the  middle elongations, which is composed of the optical and physical parts, has the whole eccentricity 3600 (or 3592) as its sine. ['3600']\n",

      "For when the diagram was set out above, the mean anomaly denoted angles about γ. But now you will begin with angles about β, smaller than the optical equation about γ. And 91° 1' 53\" of mean anomaly shows you a distance of 99,984. ['99,984']\n",
      "First let there be an unbisected eccentricity of 3600 on the line of apsides AF, with CE and CD accordingly radii of the orb; and let the anomaly FAE be 45°, and FAD 135°. ['3600']\n",

      "And as this the area of the circle is to the 360° of mean anomaly or time (that is, 21,600' or 1,296,000\"), so is the area of the triangle, 90,000,000, to 3713\"; that is, 1° 1' 53\". ['21,600']\n",
      "Since BEA is 3713\", as its altitude EB is to HL or GM, the altitudes of the other triangles —that is, as the whole sine is to the sines of the eccentric anomaly HBC, GBC—so is 3713\" to the areas of the remaining triangles. ['3713']\n",
      "So 3713\" will be multiplied by the sines of the angles at B, and, with the last five digits struck, the remainder will be the physical part of the equation expressed in seconds, corresponding to the angle at B. For example, let HBC be 45° 43' 46\", as it was above in Ch. ['3713']\n",
