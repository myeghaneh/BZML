       "6694   As shown in Figure 2B, the Sun is assumed to be at the center of the planetary system. The longitudes of Mars and Earth's in reference to the center of the Sun are 198° 21' 30\" and 199° 20' 8\" respectively. The deviation of elongation between Mars and the Earth remain 58' 38\". To find the position of Mars at opposition, Kepler computed the angular distance that Mars and Earth—now substituting the place of the Sun—moved during 17 hours 20 minutes; Mars moved eastward about 16' 20\" and the Sun westward about 42' 18\". Accordingly, Kepler determined the longitude of Mars at opposition to be 198° 37' 50\" from which he subtracted about 39\" in order to correct Mars's orbit; he got 198° 37' 10\" (18° 37' 10\" Libra).   \n",

Light is impeded by the opaque, but is not impeded by a body, because light is light, and does not act upon the body but on the surface (or as if on the surface). Power acts upon the body without respect to its opacity. Therefore, since it is not correlated with the opaque, it will likewise not be impeded by the opaque.   \n",

Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there. Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate. But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet. It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it.

Its altitude being 35½°, it was not subject to refraction. After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. This would have appeared larger, except that Mars was low enough to be refracted, and appeared too high. For the refraction at this altitude is 3½’, of which about 2' is accounted to the latitude; thus, the apparent latitude would be 5' south. But since we are...</td>\n",

       "4  Let us begin with the nodes. On 1593 December 10, at 7h 0m in the evening, Mars was observed at 4° 44' Aries, with latitude 0° 1' 15\" south, parallax not accounted for ^1. Its altitude being 35½°, it was not subject to refraction. After the 687 days of one complete revolution of Mars, on 1595 October 28 at 11h 30m pm Mars was found at an altitude of 51° in 18° 35' Taurus, with latitude 4½’ south, parallax not accounted for ^2. And again, 687 days previously, on 1592 January 23, at 10h pm, it again had a southern latitude of 2', with an altitude of 25° ^3. And finally, subtracting another 687 days, so that we come to 1590 March 7, Mars was observed on March 4 at 7h, at an altitude of 14°, to have a latitude of 3' 20\" south ^4. This would have appeared larger, except that Mars was low enough to be refracted, and appeared too high. For the refraction at this altitude is 3½’, of which about 2' is accounted to the latitude; thus, the apparent latitude would be 5' south. But since we are...   \n",
