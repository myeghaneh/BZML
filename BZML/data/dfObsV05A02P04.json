hypotheses of Chapter 16 shows it to be at 29\u00b0 52' 55\" for the first of the times.","3735":"But previously and in like manner we took at \u03b1\u03b9 1588 November 22 at 9h 2\u00bdm to be 29\u00b0 20' 12\" Leo.","3736":"From 1588 November 22 at 9h 2\u00bdm to 1589 November 1 at 6h 10m are 344 days diminished by 2h 52\u00bdm while a whole revolution to the same fixed star has 687 days diminished by 0h 28 min.","3737":"Therefore, our interval appears to exceed half the periodic time by a few hours.","3738":"Consider:","3739":"And from the position at the earlier time, 29\u00b0 20' 12\" Leo, to the position which Mars held at the later time, 29\u00b0 54' 53\" Aquarius, is 180\u00b0 34' 41\", or 180\u00b0 33' 53\" with the precession of 48\" subtracted.","3740":"Therefore, if the excess of 33' 53\" beyond the semicircle is sufficient for the 10 hours 6\u00bd minutes from Mars's diurnal motion on the eccentric, the aphelion would consequently be understood to be at 29\u00b0 20' 12\" Leo.","3741":"But we know the diurnal motions of Mars on the eccentric near apogee and perigee from the distances just found and from the demonstrations of Chapter 32.","3742":"For the diurnal motions are approximately in the [inverse] duplicate ratio of the distances.","3743":"At apogee the diurnal motion is about 26' 13\", at perigee 38' 2\", since the mean diurnal motion is 31' 27\".","3744":"Consider, then: if Mars, in moving from its apogee point, expends half its periodic time, at the end of this time, having traversed exactly 180 degrees, it is going to be at the perigee point.","3745":"But now if it begins this space of time one day after it was at apogee, it will begin its course 26' 13\" beyond apogee and will end it at 180\u00b0 38' 2\".","3746":"Therefore, in half the time it will traverse 11' 49\" more than half the path.","3747":"The opposite will happen if it were to begin one day before apogee.","3748":"Therefore, since our time, too, shows an arc greater [than a semicircle], our aphelion also should be moved forward.","3749":"First, we shall credit half of our hours to the time before aphelion, and half after perihelion.","3750":"The planet will then begin from 5' 16\" before aphelion, which is thus put at 29\u00b0 25' 28\" Leo, and it will come to 8' 1\" after perihelion, the amount of travel being 13' 17\" beyond 180\u00b0.","3751":"But its path was seen to be 33' 53\" beyond 180\u00b0.","3752":"Therefore, it is still faster by 20' 36\".","3753":"Therefore, since to increase the path by 11' 49\", one day, or the promotion of the planet to 26\u2019 13\" beyond aphelion, is needed, how much will the planet be promoted from aphelion to increase the path by 20\u2019 36\"?","3754":"The rule of proportions shows it to be 1 day 17h 54m, or a distance from aphelion of 45' 42\".","3755":"Therefore, the aphelion is to be moved forward 45' 42\" from the position we just gave it, 29\u00b0 25' 28\" Leo.","3756":"To which of the investigations of the aphelion one ought to give more trust, is uncertain.","3757":"For it can easily happen that in the positioning and assuming of the lines \u03b1\u03b9, \u03b1\u03b8 we have erred by 4 minutes, two for the one and two for the other, owing to difficulties in the observations.","3758":"And this is all that needs to be accumulated, through the compounding of errors, to change the aphelion by 11 minutes.","3759":"Here, however, it is reasonable for us to trust the present operation.","3760":"Correction of the mean motion","3761":"When the aphelion is changed, the mean motion is changed as well.","3762":"For at the same time at which in the previous investigation of the aphelion Mars is thought to fall at aphelion, with no equation, it has now passed the aphelion by 11 minutes.","3763":"Therefore, it has an equation of 4 minutes, subtractive.","3764":"Thus in its mean motion it has passed that original position by 4' ^23.","3765":"Investigation of the eccentricity","3766":"First, the distances found previously should be corrected, if necessary, to the extent that they are some small amount distant from the apsides just found, the aphelia by 40 minutes, perihelia by 75 minutes.","3767":"But there is no perceptible change so close to the apsides.","3768":"And as 152,640 is to 100,000, so is 14,140 to the eccentricity 9264.","3769":"But half the eccentricity of the equating point was 9282.","3770":"The difference of 18 is clearly of no importance.","3771":"You see how precisely the eccentricity of the equating point is to be bisected in Mars in order to establish the distance between the centers of the eccentric and the world.","3772":"Above, in Chapter 32, I took this to be fundamental, and in the following chapters postponed its demonstration.","3773":"Now, however, that obligation is discharged.","3774":"Chapter 43","3775":"On the defect in the equations accumulated by bisection of the eccentricity and the use of triangular areas, on the supposition that the planet's orbit is perfectly circular.","3776":"What was proved in Part III concerning the bisection of the eccentricity in the theory of the sun has now likewise been demonstrated with perfect certainty for Mars.","3777":"And now that our evidence of this is complete, it would at last be time to proceed to the physical theories of Chapters 32 and the following, seeing that they are going to apply to all planets in common, had I not seen fit to present them earlier.","3778":"I did so because there, in the theory of the sun or earth, the procedure for computing the equations from physical causes had to be completed with full perfection, and because I knew that where that method of constructing the equations is to be applied to the theory of Mars, much more difficult physical theories were to follow.","3779":"Now when the true configuration of the orbits is found, the eccentric equations, upon which alone the vicarious hypothesis found in Chapter 16 has hitherto depended, must necessarily follow by the same means.","3780":"We shall therefore explore it in turn here.","3781":"Therefore, following what was demonstrated in Chapter 40 (all of which, in every detail, is to be understood as holding here), let the orbit of the planet, in accord with the well-worn opinion, be circular, even though Ch.","3782":"41 has just urged us to doubt it.","3783":"Therefore, at the eccentric anomaly of 90\u00b0 the eccentricity 9264 found in Ch.","3784":"42 will be the tangent, which will give the optical part of the equation, 5\u00b0 17' 34\".","3785":"And since at the eccentric anomaly of 90\u00b0 the area of the triangle is right-angled, the radius multiplied by half the eccentricity, 4632, gives the area of the triangle, 463,200,000.","3786":"Now as the area of the circle, 31,415,926,536, is to 360 degrees or 1,296,000 seconds, so is this area just found, 463,200,000, to 19,108\", or 5\u00b0 18' 28\", the physical part of the equation.","3787":"Consequently, the whole equation is 10\u00b0 36' 2\", so that to the mean anomaly of 95\u00b0 18' 28\" corresponds the equated anomaly of 84\u00b0 42' 26\".","3788":"But according to the method of Chapter 18, the vicarious hypothesis, accurate enough for the longitudes, shows us that to the mean anomaly of 95\u00b0 18' 28\" there ought to correspond the equated anomaly of 84\u00b0 42' 2\".","3789":"The difference is 24\".","3790":"Now let our eccentric anomaly be taken as 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0.","3791":"And as the whole sine is to the sine of these angles, so is 19,108\", the area of the greatest triangle of the equation, to the area at this position, 13,512\", or 3\u00b0 45' 12\", so that by addition of this the physical part of the equation to the eccentric anomaly the mean anomalies of 48\u00b0 45' 12\" and 138\u00b0 45' 12\" are constructed.","3792":"But from the given sides of the given angles, the angles of equated anomaly corresponding to these mean anomalies come out to be 41\u00b0 28' 54\" and 130\u00b0 59' 25\".","3793":"But by the vicarious hypothesis, as in Chapter 18 of this work, the same simple anomalies of 48\u00b0 45' 12\" and 138\u00b0","3794":"45' 12\" being taken, the equated anomaly for the former comes out to be 41\u00b0 20' 33\", less than by the area of the triangle, the excess being 8' 21\"; and for the latter, 131\u00b0 7' 26\", more than by the area of the triangle, the defect being 8'.","3795":"So, since it is certain that an error of this magnitude cannot be attributed to our vicarious hypothesis, I had to accept that this procedure for finding the  equations was still imperfect.","3796":"Indeed, in Chapter 19 as well, when I tried out the bisection on Mars and computed the equations using a motionless point of the equant in the Ptolemaic manner, a difference was found at about 45\u00b0 of eccentric anomaly of nearly the same amount, but in the opposite direction.","3797":"For in the upper quadrant, the planet was closer to the aphelion, and in the lower to the perihelion, than it should have been; while here in the upper quadrant it was farther from the aphelion, and in the lower from the perihelion, than it should be.","3798":"And so in the upper quadrant it is moving too swiftly away from the aphelion, and the same from the perihelion below.","3799":"Therefore, it is slower than it should be in the middle elongations.","3800":"I believe it has just occurred to the reader that the cause of these errors might  perhaps lie in the flaw to which this operation with areas is subject, mentioned in Chapter 40: that the areas are not equivalent to the distances that modify the swiftness and slowness.","3801":"But the present error cannot arise thence.","3802":"For first of all, the excess of the sum of the distances over the area of the circle is small: just about as small, that is, as the little space between the conchoids.","3803":"Then, too, the area makes all the distances a little smaller than they should be, and most of all those that are at the middle elongations.","3804":"So if any error flows from this, it lies in our not having made the planet take enough time in the middle elongations.","3805":"But the errors we are now seeing are in the opposite direction, for we have made the planet take too much time in the middle elongations.","3806":"The same can be raised in objection to anyone who might conceive a suspicion that the error arose because we rejected the double epicycle of Copernicus and Tycho, which makes the orbit of the planet oval, and took up the Ptolemaic perfect circle in the present account.","3807":"For it was said at the end of Chapter 4 that the Copernican orbit moves outwards from the center by 246 parts, which would only increase the error, rather than making an incursion towards the center, as would suit our purposes, since we are now following the idea that the time increments are proportional to the distances.","3808":"But to make it clear to the eye that the area of  the conchoid of Ch.","3809":"40 is made very small, consider that the secant of the angle 5\u00b0 19' (the maximum optical equation) is 100,432, which is the line EA.","3810":"So from this excess of 432, which is the small line BA, part of the line EA, we will be able to get an approximate idea of the sum of all these excesses (such as, QA, RA, BA, SA, LA) in this way.","3811":"The secant of 89\u00b0, and its tangent, taken together, are as great as the sines  of all degrees of the whole semicircle, as Cardano helps us see in the part of De subtilitate in which he explains the properties of the circle ^1.","3812":"A proof of this is given by Justus Byrgius ^2.","3813":"Therefore, if all our remaining excesses (other than the greatest, 432) were [to the greatest]3 as [all] the sines in one semicircle are to the semidiameter, then as 100,000 is to the sum of the secant and the tangent of 89\u00b0 (that is, 11,458,869), so,  approximately, would 432 be to 49,934, the approximate sum of all the excesses at integral degrees of the semicircle ^4.","3814":"For the excesses of the distances in the upper quadrant are longer than those excesses of the secants, to about the same extent that they are shorter in the lower quadrant.","3815":"But nevertheless, it is not true that the excesses QA, RA, SA, and so on, are to one another as the sines of the corresponding number of degrees ^5.","3816":"Instead, they are approximately in the duplicate ratio of the sines.","3817":"As for example, the sine of 90\u00b0 is twice the sine of 30\u00b0.","3818":"Now the optical equation of 90\u00b0 is 5\u00b0 19', and half of its sine gives an arc which is likewise about its half, that is, 2\u00b0 39\u2019 15\", for the optical equation at 30\u00b0 of eccentric anomaly, whose secant is 100,107.","3819":"And here 107, the excess of the secant over the radius, is about one fourth of the former, 432, while the sine of 30\u00b0 would be half the sine of 90\u00b0.","3820":"Some geometer should see whether this argument be demonstrable.","3821":"For me it suffices at present to answer those very small questions with which I am occupied.","3822":"Therefore, to arrive at 432, parts are accumulated that are not proportional to the sines, but are always smaller, and at the 45th degree or thereabouts are but their halves.","3823":"Before that point they are less than the halves, so that about 30\u00b0 they are only the fourths, and at length become imperceptible.","3824":"And so, of the sum of 49,934, we retain only one seventh, or about 7000.","3825":"This is also shown empirically, by computing all the distances degree by degree and adding them up ^6.","3826":"And because one distance of 100,000 has the value of 60', this little sum has a value of no more than 4\u2155\u20197 which is nonetheless spread all around the circumference, so that about 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0, where it is greatest, this tiny error turns out to be imperceptible even in Mars.","3827":"Consequently, we must seek another occasion for this discrepancy.","3828":"Chapter 44","3829":"The path of the planet through the ethereal air is not a circle, not even with respect to the first inequality alone, even if you mentally remove the Brahean and Ptolemaic complex of spirals resulting from the second inequality in these two authors.","3830":"With the eccentricity and the ratio of the orbs established with the utmost certainty, it might appear strange to an astronomer that there remains yet another impediment in the way of astronomy's triumph.","3831":"And me, Lord knows, I had triumphed for two full years.","3832":"Nevertheless, by a comparison of the things which have  been established in Chapters 41, 42, and 43, preceding, it is readily apparent what we are still lacking.","3833":"The positions of the aphelia, eccentricity, and the ratio of the orbs, as constituted in the several places, differed greatly from one another.","3834":"Nor were the computed physical equations in agreement with the observations (which the vicarious hypothesis represents).","3835":"Let the diagram of Chapter 41 be brought back.","3836":"And because, in that diagram, in units of which \u03b3\u03b7 was 151,740, \u03b3\u03b1 would have been 14,822, when \u03b3\u03b1 and \u03b3\u03b7 or \u03b3\u03b5 are added, \u03b1\u03b5 would be 166,562.","3837":"In Chapter 42 this was found to be 166,780.","3838":"Likewise, when \u03b3\u03b1 is subtracted from \u03b3\u03b4, the remainder, \u03b1\u03b4, would be 136,918, which in Chapter 42 was found to be fully 138,500.","3839":"Again, the true length of the lines \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b1\u03b5, and \u03b1\u03b4 was found in Chapter 421 If, therefore, what was supposed and used in Chapter 41 is true, that the path of the planet is a circle, it is not difficult to say how much \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b8 ought to be.","3840":"Since in Oct.","3841":"1590 \u03b1\u03b5 was at 28\u00b0 41' 40\" Leo, and \u03ba, \u03b7, \u03b8 are as given in Chapter 41, the angles \u03ba\u03b1\u03b3, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b3, \u03b8\u03b1\u03b3 will be given.","3842":"Therefore, the optical equation will also be given: \u03b1\u03ba\u03b3 0\u00b0 53' 13\", \u03b1\u03b7\u03b3 3\u00b0 10' 24\", \u03b1\u03b8\u03b3 5\u00b0 8' 47\" ^2.","3843":"And as the sine of these angles is to the truest eccentricity \u03b1\u03b3, 14,140, so are the sines of \u03ba\u03b3\u03b5, \u03b7\u03b3\u03b5, \u03b8\u03b3\u03b1 to \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b8.","3844":"3\nIf anyone wishes to attribute this difference to the slippery luck of observing, he must surely not have felt nor paid attention to the force of the demonstrations used hitherto, and will be shamelessly imputing to me the vilest fraud in corrupting the observations of Brahe.","3845":"I therefore appeal to the observations of subsequent years, at least those that experienced observers made.","3846":"For if in any respect I have given free rein to my inclinations in one direction, it will only go so much the farther into error on the other side.","3847":"But there is no need of this.","3848":"I am addressing this to you who are experienced in matters astronomical, who know that in astronomy there is no tolerance for the sophistical loopholes that beset other disciplines.","3849":"To you I appeal.","3850":"You see at \u03ba a small defect from the circle, at \u03b7, \u03b8 on both sides, a rather large one, enough so that we cannot excuse it by uncertainties in observing (for in Chapter 42 I reckon an uncertainty of perhaps 200, or at most 300 units).","3851":"What, then, is to be said?","3852":"Could this actually be the situation described in Chapter 6 above, in which by transposition of the reference point from the sun's mean motion to its apparent motion I set up another eccentric that makes an excursion towards the side of the sun's apogee?","3853":"By no means.","3854":"For there, it would approach from the one side by the same amount as it moves away on the other.","3855":"Here, however, you see that the planet approaches the center from the circular orbit on both sides.","3856":"This is confirmed by many other observations, some of which follow below in Chapters 51 and 53.","3857":"Clearly, then, [what is to be said] is this: the orbit of the planet is not a circle, but comes in gradually on both sides and returns again to the circle's distance at perigee.","3858":"They are accustomed to call the shape of this sort of path  \"oval.\"","3859":"This same thing is also proved from Chapter 43 preceding.","3860":"There it was  supposed that the area of a perfect eccentric is very closely equivalent to all the distances of the equal parts of the circumference of that eccentric from the source of the motive power, however many they are.","3861":"Thus, the parts of the area measure the amounts of time which the planet spends on the parts of the corresponding eccentric circumference.","3862":"But if that area about which the planet marks a boundary is not a perfect circle, but is diminished at the sides from the amplitude it has at the apsides, and if nevertheless this area circumscribed by an irregular orbit still measures the times which the planet takes to traverse the whole and its equal parts, then this diminished area measures a time equal to that measured by the previous undiminished area.","3863":"So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there.","3864":"So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened.","3865":"Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4.","3866":"And indeed, if contraries remedy one another, this is plainly the aptest medicine for purging the faults under which, in Chapter 43 above, our physical hypothesis was perceived to be laboring.","3867":"For the planet is going to be swifter at the middle elongations, where previously it was perceived to be going slower than it should, and it will be slowed down above and below, near the apsides, where previously it did violence to the equations belonging to the eighths of the period through its excessive fleetness.","3868":"This, then, is the other argument by which it is proved that the orbit of the planet really is deflected from the established circle, making ingress towards the sides and the centre of the eccentric.","3869":"But for all that, this argument still did not have enough effect upon me to let me go beyond it and think about the planet's departure from the orbit.","3870":"When I had sweated for the longest time trying to reconcile equations of this sort, I was finally discouraged by the absurdity of the measurements, and abandoned the whole enquiry until I was informed by the distances (found in the way shown in Chapter 41) about the departure from the [circular] orbit, and once more took up this problem of the equations.","3871":"And from this, what I promised I would prove, in Chapters 20 and 23 above, is now done: that the orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape.","3872":"Chapter 45","3873":"On the natural causes of this deflection of the planet from the circle: first opinion examined.","3874":"When I was first informed in this manner by Brahe's most certain  observations that the orbit of the planet is not exactly circular but is deficient at the sides, I judged that I also knew the natural cause of the deflection from its footprints.","3875":"For I had worked very hard on that subject in Chapter 39.","3876":"And I suggest to the reader that he reread that entire chapter carefully before going on.","3877":"For in that chapter I assigned the cause of the eccentricity to a certain power that is in the body of the planet.","3878":"It therefore followed that the cause of this deflecting from the eccentric circle should also be ascribed to the same body of the planet.","3879":"But then what they say in the proverb, \"A hasty dog bears blind pups,\" happened to me.","3880":"For in Chapter 39,1 worked very energetically on the question of why I could not state a probable enough cause for a perfect circle's resulting from the orbit of the planet, as some absurdities always had to be attributed to the power that has its seat in the planet's body.","3881":"Now, having seen from the observations that the planet's orbit is not perfectly circular, I immediately succumbed to this great persuasive impetus, believing that from those things which were called absurd in fabricating the circle in Chapter 39, now transmuted into a more probable form, an orbit of the planet that would be both correct and in agreement with the observations would be effected.","3882":"If I had embarked upon this path a little more thoughtfully, I might have immediately arrived at the truth of the matter.","3883":"But since I was blind from desire, and did not pay attention to each and every part of Chapter 39, staying instead with the first thought to offer itself\u2014a wonderfully probable one, owing to the uniformity of the epicyclic motion\u2014I entered into new labyrinths, from which we will have to extract ourselves in this Chapter 45 and the following ones all the way to 50.","3884":"Let the diagram from Chapter 39 be repeated.","3885":"The weaker opinion in that chapter was that, in order to describe a perfect circle, the planet effects an epicycle by its inherent force, thus disengaging its body from the ray of power from the sun.","3886":"As, for example, if the ray of power from the sun be AC, and move forward at an unequal pace from AC to A\u03b3, while the planet be initially at C, and from that time forth, by its inherent force, it disengage itself from [the ray] AC or A\u03b3.","3887":"Thus, at the time when AC comes to A\u03b3, the planet from C or \u03b3 would come to D, and would also do this at a nonuniform pace, more swiftly or slowly in the same proportion as [the length of] AC.","3888":"For in this fashion the line ND through the center  of the epicycle and the planet remains ever parallel to the line AB.","3889":"However, I said in Chapter 39 that it appeared absurd to me that the planet [in moving] from \u03b3 to D at a nonuniform pace disengages itself from the ray of the solar power, and thus accommodates itself by its own force to the extrinsic force from the sun, and has foreknowledge of its speed and the decrease thereof.","3890":"Therefore, to avoid this absurdity, let AC still go nonuniformly, but let the planet go uniformly from \u03b3 to D. Let us see whether what follows is anything like what we have proved in the preceding chapter from the observations.","3891":"While the center of the epicycle N and its aphelion [in moving] from the line AC to A\u03b3 will be slow from C to \u03b3, it being near the eccentric's aphelion C, let the planet [in moving] from \u03b3 to D be supposed not to be slow but to proceed with its mean motion.","3892":"Consequently, the angle \u03b3ND will be greater than the angle \u03b3AC.","3893":"So ND will not be parallel to AB but will be inclined towards AC.","3894":"Thus the planet D will not stay on the circle which it began to describe from C, the one, that is, which goes through CF, but will encroach from the circumference D and the parallel ND towards CA.","3895":"And this same thing was also affirmed in the previous chapter by the distances AD computed from the observations, namely, that they do not reach all the way to the circumference of the circle CF.","3896":"This same thing was also affirmed by the physical equations constructed through the summation of the distances AC, AD, namely, that the planet ought to be faster at the sides of the eccentric; that is, that its distances from the sun ought to be supposed smaller.","3897":"Therefore, since this consensus brought to bear a considerable force of persuasion, I concluded forthwith that the planet's incursion at the sides is the result of this: that the power moving the planet and administering the distances according to the law of the circle supersedes the power of the sun, in that the former made equal progress in equal times thus sending the planet down uniformly towards the sun according to the law of the epicycle, while the latter, in its varying degrees [of speed obtained] through the varying distances, moved the planet in its care forward nonuniformly, and more slowly when it is high.","3898":"It thus happened that the distances of equal arcs on the epicycle were accumulated near the aphelion C and the perihelion F, and were more sparsely scattered about the middle elongations.","3899":"In this way, all the shorter ones were drawn back upwards from the correct [circular] distances from perihelion to the place of longer ones.","3900":"That error therefore began to become rooted in me which I had happily begun to refute in Chapter 39 above, that it is a property of the planetary power to lead the body of the planet around in the path of an epicycle.","3901":"Had the diameter of the epicycle ND remained equidistant from AB, I could have shed my erroneous opinion, and could have ascribed (as is perfectly correct) all promotion in zodiacal longitude to the sun, leaving to the planet only the reciprocation on the diameter \u03b3\u03b6, as in part of Chapter 39.","3902":"But because the observations testified that the diameter of the epicycle is inclined in the middle elongations, this error concerning the motion of the planet on the circumference of the epicycle, whose motion would be regular measured with respect to the line \u0391\u039d\u03b3 going from the sun A through the center of  the epicycle N, was admirably confirmed in me.","3903":"Think yourself, reader, and you will feel the force of the argument.","3904":"For I did not think it possible for the planet's orbit to be rendered oval in any other way.","3905":"When, therefore, these things occurred to me, quite certain of the quantity of the incursion at the sides (that is, that the numbers would be in agreement), I celebrated another triumph over Mars.","3906":"Nor did it appear to me any difficulty, if there were some discord among the numbers, to dissipate it through some slight adjustment in the equations of the center1 all around, so as to make it imperceptible.","3907":"And we, good reader, can fairly indulge in so splendid a triumph for a brief day's respite (for the following five chapters, that is), meanwhile repressing the rumors of renewed rebellion, lest its splendor die before we enjoy it.","3908":"If anything will be left of it afterwards, we shall go through it in the proper time and order.","3909":"We are merry indeed now, but [will be] active and energetic then.","3910":"Chapter 46","3911":"How the line of the planet\u2019s motion can be described from the opinion of Chapter 45, and what its properties are.","3912":"In the preceding chapter a cause was stated by which it could happen that the planet depart from a circular orbit.","3913":"However, the geometrical description of the path cannot be carried out using this model.","3914":"For the epicycle is inclined according to the length of the distances, while the multitude and length of the distances is in turn dependent upon the rotation of the epicycle.","3915":"And because the sum of the distances is contained in the plane of the eccentric, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, that sum cannot be found unless the epicycle be transformed into an eccentric.","3916":"But it was demonstrated in Chapter 2, and repeated in Chapter 39, and used in Chapter 40, that if a concentric be described about center \u03b1 with semidiameter equal to \u03b2\u03b4, and on it an epicycle with semidiameter \u03b1\u03b2; and then about center \u03b2 an eccentric \u03b4\u03bb with eccentricity \u03b1\u03b2; and afterwards the circumferences of both the epicycle and the eccentric \u03b4\u03bb be divided into similar parts; the distances of the points of division, both of the epicycle and the eccentric, from the chosen point \u03b1 are respectively equal to one another in length.","3917":"On this premise, since in Chapter 40 we posited an eccentric to present a plain and easy demonstration, and a method of computing the distances, here, too, we can examine the distances on the eccentric, even though we are supposing them to be meted out by the uniform motion of the planet\u2019s epicycle.","3918":"This procedure seems to open a way to us to a geometrical description of the planetary path that follows from the hypothesis of Chapter 45.","3919":"Let us therefore say, for the sake  of understanding, that in the circuit of the epicycle the planet makes digressions from the sun \u03b1 of the same magnitude as if it were on the circumference of a perfect eccentric \u03b4\u03bb (and let this be a semicircle defined by the straight line \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4) describing equal arcs in equal times, such as \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b5\u03b6, \u03b6\u03b8, \u03b8\u03b9, \u03b9\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bb.","3920":"It does this in such a manner that the angles at \u03b2 are equal, and \u03b2 is the point of uniform motion, at least for this position for which the distances are being sought.","3921":"Let the points of division be connected to \u03b1 and \u03b2. Now this semicircle is purely fictitious: it should be drawn only for computing the sum of a number of distances.","3922":"If the planet were moved forward with the same degree of power from the sun at both \u03b4 and \u03bb, in the same manner as the epicyclical rotation is supposed to be always uniformly set in motion, then it really would traverse these equal parts of the eccentric, from which we have taken the distances, in equal times; and also, the distances corresponding to the times denoted by the points of division would be these very ones, \u03b1\u03b4, \u03b1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03b6, \u03b1\u03b8, \u03b1\u03b9, \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03bb, not only in quantity, but also in their identical position.","3923":"In a word, the path of the planet would be the circle \u03b4\u03b8\u03bb.","3924":"The planet does in fact represent quantitatively the reported distances resulting from the uniform rotation of the epicycle, but is itself moved forward unequally in equal times by the sun, less at \u03b4, more at \u03bb. Thus in the time signified and measured by \u03b4\u03b2\u03b5*,  it does not traverse the space \u03b4\u03b5, although it does attain the distance \u03b1\u03b5.","3925":"And in [that same] time (measured by the angle \u03bb\u03b2\u03ba, equal to \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4) it traverses more space than \u03ba\u03bb, although it attains the length of the distance \u03b1\u03ba ^1.","3926":"Therefore, the planet has a length of distance \u03b1\u03b5 before it is actually moved forward to \u03b5, and a length of distance \u03b1\u03ba before it is moved forward to \u03ba; and inversely, when it is moved forward to \u03b5 or \u03ba, it has already been at the distances \u03b1\u03b5 and \u03b1\u03ba, and for that reason it will now be somewhat nearer.","3927":"Thus the planet, when at \u03b5, \u03ba, and all the other points of this sort, is nearer to the point \u03b1 than are the points \u03b5, \u03ba on the circumference.","3928":"So the planet moves inward from the established distance of the circle \u03b4\u03bb towards the point \u03b1 which is near the center \u03b2, never coinciding with this circle at any points other than \u03b4, \u03bb. For the manner of the incursion is the same in the opposite semicircle.","3929":"Also, the plane \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6, and so on, contains in itself the sum of the distances of all the points on the arc of the epicycle, which, by Chapter 40, is similar to the arc \u03b4\u03b5.","3930":"And yet the planet, in equal times (which are now being measured by \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b5\u03b6), describes unequal arcs on its real path, short when it is far from the sun \u03b1, long when it moves near to the sun, in such a way that the arcs of the planetary path which are traversed in equal times are in the inverse ratio of the distances, by Ch.","3931":"32.","3932":"It thus happens that the arc \u03b5\u03b4 (which is here the measure of the time) exceeds the arc of the path traversed, which let be \u03bc\u03b4, to about the same extent that the area \u03b5\u03b1\u03b4 exceeds the sector \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4, whose measure is the angle \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4 or the arc \u03b5\u03b4.","3933":"If you declare the entire plane area to be 360\u00b0 in number, just as the circumference  of the circle, and the periodic time as well, then the number of the time, or \u03b4\u03b5 (at this position) is approximately the mean, either arithmetic or geometric (for they hardly differ) between the number of the sum of the distances or the area \u03b5\u03b1\u03b4, and the number  of the planetary path or \u03bc\u03b4.","3934":"There occurs here a multiple obstacle to calculation ^2.","3935":"First, that the plane of the circle is not perfectly equivalent to the sum of the distances, as was demonstrated in Chapter 40, even though it was said at the end of Chapter 43 that the defect is quite small.","3936":"Second, that the proportion just described is not exactly geometrical.","3937":"True, the individual distances are to the individual mean distances in the inverse ratio of the individual arcs of the planetary path to the mean arcs.","3938":"But the sum of a certain number of distances does not maintain the same ratio to the sum of the same number of mean distances, as the sum of the same number of arcs to the sum of the mean arcs, inversely.","3939":"As you will see from an example.","3940":"Let the two distances be 12 and 11, the mean 10, and let the mean arc be the same.","3941":"And let it be that, as the distance 12 is to the mean distance 10, so is the mean arc 10 to the arc 8\u2153 belonging to the distance 12.","3942":"Let it also be that as the distance 11 is to 10, so is the arc 10 to 9$\\frac{1}{11}$\u00b7.","3943":"Compound the distances 12 and 11 into one sum, which will be 23.","3944":"The sum of the two means is 20, the sum of the two arcs is 17$\\frac{14}{33}$.","3945":"Here, 10 was indeed the mean proportional between 12 and 8\u2153, and between 11 and 9$\\frac{1}{11}$, but now the sum 20 is not the mean proportional between 23 and 17$\\frac{14}{33}$, but between 23 and 17$\\frac{19}{23}$, which is greater ^3.","3946":"However, this ratio is valid for the arithmetic mean.","3947":"For example, let 10 be the arithmetic mean between 12 and 8; likewise, between 11 and 9.","3948":"Compound 12 and 11: they make 23.","3949":"Compound 8 and 9: they make 17.","3950":"Therefore, 20 is again the arithmetic mean between 17 and 23.","3951":"And since it was demonstrated in Chapter 32 that there is hardly any difference for the present undertaking between the arithmetic and geometric means, what is here denied to be true for all cases will therefore be only slightly different from the truth.","3952":"Third, even if the area \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4 were the exact geometric mean between \u03b5\u03b1\u03b4 and \u03bc\u03b2\u03b4, nonetheless, it cannot be constructed geometrically.","3953":"For the triangle \u03b1\u03b5\u03b2 ought to be equal to the sector \u03b5\u03b2\u03bc.","3954":"But geometers have yet to devise a method by which a given angle can be cut in a given ratio.","3955":"Fourth, if none of the above deter us, the sector \u03bc\u03b2\u03b4 of the circle is still not the same as the so-called \"sector\" \u03bc\u03b2\u03b4 of the oval plane.","3956":"Therefore, even if the arc \u03bc\u03b4  were defined as if it were on the circumference of a circle, nevertheless, nothing would follow concerning \u03bc\u03b4 defined as if it were an arc on the path of the planet, which is not a circle.","3957":"Therefore, even though this is helpful to those who would like to make use of numbers, to know that \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4 is a mean between \u03b5\u03b1\u03b4 and \u03bc\u03b2\u03b4; nevertheless, for us, who strive after a geometrical path, this passage does not lie open.","3958":"We shall therefore try another way.","3959":"And on our fictitious eccentric \u03b4\u03b8\u03bb the measure of the time is \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b6 for finding out the distances \u03b1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03b6, while the ratio of the sectors \u03b4\u03b2\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b2\u03b6 to one another is the same as that of the arcs \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b6.","3960":"However, on the true path of the planet, the plane [area] lying between the arc of the path and the sun \u03b1 is likewise the true measure of the time during which the planet is found on the arc lying above it, by Chapter 40.","3961":"Therefore, from the point \u03b1 of the diameter  let straight lines be projected enclosing spaces equal to \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4, \u03b6\u03b2\u03b4, so that the space \u03b5\u03b7\u03bc, which is subtracted from the space \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4, is equal to the space \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2, which is added to that same space \u03b5\u03b2\u03b4.","3962":"And let these lines be \u03b1\u03bc, \u03b1\u03bd.","3963":"And about center \u03b1, with radii \u03b1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03b6, let arcs \u03b5\u03bc, \u03b6\u03bd be drawn intersecting these lines at \u03bc, \u03bd. Will the points \u03bc, \u03bd, o, \u03c0, and so on, constructed in this way, be thus obtained correctly, so that in the times \u03b4\u03b5, \u03b4\u03b6, \u03b4\u03b8, \u03b4\u03b9, \u03b4\u03ba the planet will arrive at them?","3964":"This is indeed approximately true, but here, too, three things are wanting.","3965":"First, as above, the plane is not exactly equivalent to the sum of the distances.","3966":"Second, there is no geometrical way showing how to cut a given semicircle in a given ratio with a straight line  drawn from a given point on the diameter.","3967":"Third, it is not known whether the shortfall for any of the planes \u03bc\u03b1\u03b4, \u03bd\u03b1\u03b4, and so on, produced by the deflection of \u03bc, \u03bd, from the circumference, is in the same ratio as the rest.","3968":"Nevertheless, these will still be useful to those who wish, contrary to the geometrical usage, to proceed using least parts, with the aid of numbers.","3969":"Since geometry has left us destitute, in order that we may have a  description of the line which has been born to us out of the theory of Chapter 45, let us go seek the assistance of a contrivance4 by fetching our vicarious hypothesis from Chapter 16, which places the lines \u03b1\u03bc, \u03b1\u03bd, and so on, on which the planet stands, at the correct zodiacal places at the correct times, combining it with the present fictitious eccentric \u03b4\u03b8\u03bb, from which the theory of Chapter 45 has persuaded us that we have derived the correct length of the lines \u03b1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03b6; that is, \u03b1\u03bc, \u03b1\u03bd.","3970":"And besides, it is a good idea for the sake of shedding some light to compare the two hypotheses with one another, combined into one diagram.","3971":"For although both are deceptive on certain points, each is useful for investigating particular truths (to the extent that they can be known at this point).","3972":"And in this diagram, many things which have been said so far are brought together into a single view.","3973":"Let A be the center of the earth (or of the sun, for Copernicus), AI the line of apsides, AD the eccentricity of the point of the equant.","3974":"And although it was denied in Chapter 19 that the point D could remain fixed, and AD the same, this is to be understood as true only if DA is bisected.","3975":"But if we remain at liberty to divide DA as we please, as in Chapter 16, then this point can remain fixed.","3976":"Therefore, let AD be divided in the ratio found in Chapter 16.","3977":"Let the point of division be C, and let AC be 11,332, CD 7232.","3978":"And about center C, with radius CH equal to 100,000, let the eccentric be described, as sketched out by the dotted line passing through H.

triangle \u03b1\u0392\u03b2), together with the sector \u0392\u03b2\u03b4, adds up to equal the area just found from the time.","4133":"Here one has to proceed by trial and error ^8.","4134":"When you  have obtained the angle \u0392\u03b2\u03b4, then in triangle B\u03b2\u03b1, from the angle \u03b2 and the known sides \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b2B, the angle \u0392\u03b1\u03b4 will become known.","4135":"And because the ratio B\u03bd to BC is known, B\u03b1\u03bd will also be known, and when it is subtracted, there will remain \u03bd\u03b1\u03b4, the correct equated angle for the time selected.","4136":"For example, as in Ch.","4137":"43, let the mean anomaly, that is, the artificial or astronomical numbering of time, be 95\u00b0 18' 28\".","4138":"And because 360\u00b0 is equivalent to the area of the perfect circle, 31,415,926,536, 95\u00b0 18' 28\" will therefore be equivalent to the area 8,317,172,671.","4139":"Let this be \u03b8\u03b1\u03b4.","4140":"Now, if the eccentric anomaly \u03b4\u03b8 were 90\u00b0, as  I suppose conjecturally, its sector \u03b8\u03b2\u03b4 would be 7,853,981,670.","4141":"And the sine \u03b8\u03b2 of 90\u00b0 is 100,000.","4142":"This multiplied by half the eccentricity \u03b1\u03b2, 4632, gives 463,200,000 as the area \u03b8\u03b2\u03b1.","4143":"The sum of the areas is 8,317,181,670, which is \u03b8\u03b1\u03b4, and which exceeds what it should be by some small amount.","4144":"We therefore guessed well that the angle or anomaly of the eccentric \u03b4\u03b2\u03b8 is 90\u00b0.","4145":"And because its sine is 100,000, the lunule \u03b8D cut off at \u03b8 will be 858.","4146":"Therefore, the shorter semidiameter D\u03b2 will be 99,142, which is to 100,000 as 9264 is to 9344.","4147":"This is the tangent of the angle \u03b1D\u03b2, 5\u00b0 20' 18\", making the equated anomaly D\u03b1\u03b4 84\u00b0 39' 42\".","4148":"The vicarious hypothesis shows this to be 84\u00b0 42' 2\", the difference being 2'20\".","4149":"The investigation of the eccentricity in Ch.","4150":"42 depends upon aphelial and  perihelial distances, and in these there can be some slight error which is increased tenfold in establishing the eccentricity.","4151":"Therefore, it should be noted in passing that if a perfectly reliable way of equating through the physical causes were finally found, a perfectly true eccentricity could afterwards be established, and through it the distances of aphelion and perihelion could be entirely corrected.","4152":"For example, provided we can trust the vicarious hypothesis for the planet's zodiacal longitude, and suppose that everything we have assumed here and in Ch.","4153":"45 is true, the equation has been made 2' 20\" too large here, while the optical and physical effects upon the equation at the middle elongations are equal, as here.","4154":"So the error being bisected, the half (1' 10\") should be subtracted from the angle last found, 5\u00b0 20' 18\", making it 5\u00b0 19' 8\": this shows a tangent of 9310 ^9.","4155":"Before, it was 9344.","4156":"The difference of 34 subtracted from the eccentricity 9264 would leave a corrected eccentricity of 9230.","4157":"But we shall not pursue this now, since our assumptions are wrong on the very small quantities.","4158":"Let it be enough to have noted it for future use in the chapters following next.","4159":"Let us also see what promise this form of computing equations holds at the eighths of the periodic time.","4160":"Let the mean anomaly be 48\u00b0 45' 12\", as in Ch.","4161":"43.","4162":"And since the numerical measure by which the areas are expressed is a matter of indifference, we shall retain the number 360\u00b0 for the area of the circle, and 19,108\" for the area of the greatest triangle (for just now, in the other system of numbering, it was 463,200,000).","4163":"Let us guess that the anomaly of the eccentric, or \u0392\u03b2\u03b4 in the diagram, is 45\u00b0.","4164":"Therefore, the sine, BC, is 70,711.","4165":"This, multiplied by the greatest triangle 19,108\" and with the zeroes dropped, gives the triangle B\u03b1\u03b2 as 13,512\", or 3\u00b0 45' 12\", for this location.","4166":"This, added to the sector \u0392\u03b2\u03b4, 45\u00b0, gives 48\u00b0 45' 12\" for the area B\u03b1\u03b4, which is also the mean anomaly we assumed.","4167":"We therefore  guessed the angle \u03b2 well.","4168":"Now, as the radius \u03b2\u03c6 is to \u03b2\u03be, 99,142,10 so is BC, 70,711, to C\u03bd, 70,104.","4169":"And because BC is 70,711, C\u03b2, the sine of its complement, will also be 70,711 at this location.","4170":"Therefore, C\u03b1 is 79,975.","4171":"But as this is to 100,000, so is C\u03bd to the tangent of the

mean anomaly be 138\u00b0 45' 12\", and let the area, whose angle at \u03b1 is sought, be expressed in the same units.","4175":"We will find that the sine of an angle of 135\u00b0 at \u03b2, which is 70,711, makes the sum of the sector and the area of the triangle this much.","4176":"And because, as before, the sine 70,711 is shortened in order to constitute a line of the ellipse that is applied ordinatewise11 becoming 70,104, this is now to be combined with the sine of the complement of 135\u00b0, which is 70,711, now not increased by the eccentricity \u03b1\u03b2, as before, but decreased by it, making it 61,447.","4177":"Thus, as this is to 100,000, so is 70,104 to the tangent of the required angle, 48\u00b0 45' 55\", or its supplement 131\u00b0 14' 5\".","4178":"The vicarious hypothesis shows 131\u00b0 7' 26\".","4179":"Compare this with Ch.","4180":"43, and with other methods, using this table.","4181":"So, of the two physical hypotheses for computing the eccentric equations, that one shows equations nearer the truth, which previously, in Ch.","4182":"45, also gave truer distances, namely, the last one.","4183":"And, what may seem strange, by a slight increase in the eccentricity it becomes equivalent to the Ptolemaic method, using a stable equant point and a bisected eccentricity.","4184":"And since we convicted this Ptolemaic method of error above, the physical method, which is in effect the same as the Ptolemaic, must also be somewhat askew of the truth.","4185":"And it does indeed make the planet slow near the apsides, and too swift about the middle longitudes.","4186":"This is the first argument by which it is proved that either the opinion of Chapter 45 is erroneous, or it has been transposed into numbers by an erroneous method.","4187":"But because the plane area of the circle is not equivalent to the aggregate of all the distances, nor is the oval figure that, according to the opinion of Ch.","4188":"45, Mars describes, a perfect ellipse, as we have assumed, the causes for the departure from the truth are still hidden.","4189":"For in addition to these two causes  of error in the calculation, the error can be consistent with a third cause, of the very foundation, the opinion expressed in Ch.","4190":"45.","4191":"So we have not yet set up equations according to the law of the opinion of Ch.","4192":"45, and have not yet done justice to the hypothesis we took up there, because we have been abandoned by geometry.","4193":"Therefore, we cannot yet charge it with being erroneous.","4194":"For a calculation that is going to do this points to the rule of innocence for itself ^12.","4195":"Chapter 48","4196":"A method of computing the eccentric equations by a numerical measure and division of the circumference of the ovoid described in Ch.","4197":"46.","4198":"So, since the calculation taken up in the preceding chapter was abandoned by geometry on so many counts, so as to be suspected of culpability for the excesses and defects which we noted in the eccentric equations in that chapter, I finally sought refuge in the numberings of arithmetic, by which I attempted to avoid the obstacles which stood in the way of our describing the path of the planet in Chapter 46.","4199":"For first, because the area was not the perfect measure of the sum of the distances, I dismissed the area and computed the distances of individual parts of the equally divided circumference.","4200":"Second, since the ratio did not remain the same when any given number of terms of the geometrical proportion were added, I therefore investigated each individual proportion separately for each distance in relation to its minimal arc.","4201":"Third, since the sum of any particular number of distances in Ch.","4202":"46 could not be established geometrically, I established it arithmetically.","4203":"For there was no difficulty in that.","4204":"Fourth, in carrying this out I had no dealings with sectors, whether circular or oval, and therefore it could obviously no longer be a hindrance to me that these sectors differ from one another.","4205":"And so, with renewed effort, I brooded upon it, in order to know at least at the end whether the equations shown to us by the vicarious hypothesis also follow from the hypothesis under consideration, which gives the correct distances (that is, the one following the opinion of Chapter 45.)","4206":"I approached the matter thus.","4207":"About center B, with radius BD, let the circle DGR be described, in which the line of apsides is DR, and A is the source of power or the center of the sun.","4208":"On the circle DG let the point G be chosen, and joined to B and A. And at first, let the angle GBD be the measure of the time, for computing the distance.","4209":"Consequently, GA will be the true distance of the planet from A, although the planet has not moved all the way from D to G. For this method of computing or demonstrating the distance, from Ch.","4210":"45, has  so far had the status of an assumption.","4211":"But let DG be a small part of the circle, such as 1\u00b0 out of the 360\u00b0.","4212":"And since all the distances AG of this sort at the ends D and G of all the degrees DG can be computed in this way, by what was demonstrated in Chapter 29, I gathered all the 360 distances AG into one sum, in a very long addition.","4213":"This was found to be 36,075,5621 (with an eccentricity of 9165), corresponding to the entire oval path of Mars.","4214":"Now about center A, with radius AG, let an arc, GC, be described towards D. And because the greater the distance the shorter the planet's path, when the distance of an arc of the circle DG is given (which arc is now, when we are computing the distance GA, nothing but the measure of the time), the length of the oval path DC will also be given, which the planet describes in the time DG under consideration (which is a simple anomaly of 1\u00b0).","4215":"For as the length of the whole of the oval circumference is to the sum of all the distances, so is the distance of the arc DC (found by the arc DG) to the length of its oval arc DC.","4216":"For it was proved in Ch.","4217":"33 above, and used in Chapter 46 (where the foundations for this operation were laid) that the arcs traversed are inversely as the distances.","4218":"However, I applied this precaution: that AD and AG, the distances of the ends C and D of the arc from A, be added, and the mean of the sum be taken as the genuine distance of the whole arc DC.","4219":"For let","4220":"some eccentric circle DK described about center B, be divided into any number of parts, say, at D, G, L, K, \u039c, N, and from the beginnings of the parts let arcs be drawn about the center of the world A until they intersect the lines drawn from A to the ends of the arcs, as DO, GP, LQ, KR,","4221":"MS, NT.","4222":"The areas on the left semicircle, ADO,","4223":"AGP, ALQ, will be greater than they should be, while the arcs on the right, ANT, AMS, AKR, will be less than they should be.","4224":"So, when least arcs are in question, the one is compensated by the other, so that TNA and ODA are very nearly equal to the area GDNA.","4225":"Next, the length DC in the previous diagram being thus given, to correspond to the given time DG and to the distance GA or CA, the angle of equated anomaly CAD now also should be found.","4226":"Let C be joined to B, and let AC be extended to E, where it intersects the circle, and BC to the intersection F. It was therefore not enough to know the length DC.","4227":"The angle CBD ought to have been investigated as well.","4228":"For because CD is shorter than FD, CD does not measure the angle FBD, or CBD.","4229":"And on the other hand, even though CD is shorter than FD, if you place an observer at B it appears from B to be just as much a measure of the angle CBD as is FD.","4230":"But according to the demonstrations of Chapter 32, it is true within all limits of sense perception that to the extent that FD is farther from B than is CD, FD is also longer than CD.","4231":"Also, it is true within the same limits of sense perception (for the present purposes it does not matter how acute) that CE and CF are equal (though in the truth of the matter CE is longer than CF, which is drawn through the center, by Euclid Book III prop.","4232":"7).","4233":"I have therefore supposed, first, that CD and FD are equal, and both are a measure of the angle CBD or FBD, or even EBD, as if the arc EF were  imperceptible.","4234":"Thus, from knowing CD, the angle EBD was given.","4235":"Therefore, in triangle EBA, from the angle EBA and the sides EB, BA, I sought the length of AE, whence I subtracted AC or AG computed earlier, and the remainder was CE or CF, the amount that the other end of CD approached the center B. So, when CE is bisected (for this can be done within the limits of perception) the approach of CD towards B was known, if it were to approach equally at all its points.","4236":"But from the amount of approach, the optical parallax, or the apparent size of CD, was also given: that is, the angle CBD now corrected, which was previously assumed to be a little smaller, though in our numbers there is no error.","4237":"Therefore, given the angle CBD, now corrected, which is the supplement of angle CBA, and the side CA, and the eccentricity BA, the equated anomaly CAD, which was sought, was given.","4238":"It was impossible to use this method to establish independently any equation other than the first, at a mean anomaly of 1\u00b0.","4239":"All the rest, all the way to the 180th, always presupposed that the equation immediately preceding was known.","4240":"I can't imagine anyone reading this not being overcome by the tedium of it even in the reading.","4241":"So the reader may well judge how much vexation we (my calculator and I) derived hence, as we thrice followed this method through the 180\u00b0 of anomaly, changing the eccentricity each time.","4242":"But the foundation of this calculation has not yet been laid out.","4243":"For I said that I presupposed knowledge of the length of the whole oval.","4244":"Whence, then, is this known?","4245":"As for me, once I had descended to this clumsy numbering procedure, I did not manage to avoid clumsily presupposing the length, and then, when the whole thing was complete, seeing whether in the 180th operation I came out with an apparent position of more than 180\u00b0, or less.","4246":"For if it had come out at exactly 180\u00b0, I knew that the length I had assumed for the oval was good, but if it was less, I had assumed it to be too small, and if more, greater.","4247":"Nevertheless, we are not left without a kind of geometrical helping hand for making a good guess as to the oval's length.","4248":"For as BD is to BA let BA be to DH, extended from D towards B. By what was demonstrated in Chapter 46, the rectangle contained by the breadth of the lunule and the semidiameter of the circle is nearly equal to the square on the eccentricity.","4249":"Therefore, by Euclid VI.","4250":"17, the eccentricity is the mean proportional between the breadth of the lunule and the semidiameter.","4251":"But this is how the diagram is set up.","4252":"Therefore, DH is the breadth of the lunule.","4253":"Let the half of DH also be taken, and extended from B towards D, and let it be BI.","4254":"And about center I, with radius ID, let the circle DK be described, touching the eccentric at D. And also, about center B, with radius BH, let the circle HK be described, touching the previous circle at K. It is obvious that the circle HK is smaller than DK, and the circle DGR is greater than DK.","4255":"And because circular circumferences are to one another as their semidiameters, as BD is to DI and BH, so is the greater circle DG to the smaller circles DK and KH.","4256":"But DI is the arithmetic mean between DB and HB, because BI is half of HD.","4257":"Therefore, the circle DK too, touching the smaller and larger circles described about the same center B, is the arithmetic mean between those circles that it touches.","4258":"If the oval path is continued, by hypothesis it will be tangent to the greater circle at aphelion D and perihelion R, and to the smaller circle HK at the middle elongations.","4259":"Thus, it is greater than the smaller circle HK, and smaller than the greater circle DR.","4260":"It is therefore likely that the oval circumference is not much different from the length of the circular circumference DK.","4261":"The following demonstration, however, makes one believe it to be a little larger.","4262":"Let the mean proportional between BH and BD be taken, and let it be BO, and about center B with radius BO let the circle OP be described.","4263":"Thus, by Archimedes, On Spheroids 5, the area of this circle OP will be equal to the area of an ellipse whose longer semidiameter is BD, and whose shorter is BH.","4264":"And because the greatest of all figures of equal perimeter is the circle, conversely (in the common significance of the term), of figures with equal area, the one with the shortest perimeter will be the circle.","4265":"Therefore, since the proposed figures, namely, the ellipse which has semidiameters DB, BH, and the circle OP, are equal in area, from the evidence just presented, the circumference of the ellipse will be longer than the circumference of the circle OP.","4266":"But BO is imperceptibly less than ID, since BO is taken as the geometrical mean, and ID the arithmetic mean, between the same terms.","4267":"For by the theory presented in Euclid's Book V,2 since BO is the mean proportional between HB, BD, as the lesser, HB, is to the greater, BD, so is HO, the excess of the mean, to the defect, OD.","4268":"3 Therefore, since HB is less than BD, HO will also be less than OD.","4269":"But BI is equal to the half of HD.","4270":"Therefore, BI is greater than HO, and less than OD.","4271":"Therefore, to the common semidiameter HB of the least circle HK unequals are added, namely, less than the half of DH to make BO, and half of DH to make DI.","4272":"Therefore, DI is greater than BO.","4273":"Thus the circle DK is greater than OP.","4274":"But it is only imperceptibly greater, since DH is less than a hundredth of DB.","4275":"Therefore, on the supposition that these circles are superabundantly equal, and on the supposition that the oval is a perfect ellipse, the circumference of the oval will be a little longer than the circle DK, and certainly longer than the circle OP.","4276":"And because in Ch.","4277":"47 above DH was 858 where DB was 100,000, let half of DH, 429, be subtracted from DB, 100,000.","4278":"The remainder will be 99,571.","4279":"Next, as 100,000 is to 99,571, so almost exactly will the circumference of the circle be to the circumference of the oval, which is sought.","4280":"And because the circumference of the circle has 360 degrees or 21,600', or 1,296,000\", a small part will be removed which has 5560\" or 92' 40\".","4281":"And for the semi-circumference of the oval, 46' 20\" are to be subtracted, or even less, if the oval exceeds the circle DK at the place considered in the measuring.","4282":"As for me, I made no use of any demonstration, but by a most laborious and dogged calculation found the defect of the oval semicircle to be 45' 45\", so that where the perfect semicircle is 180\u00b0, the oval would be 179\u00b0 14' 15\".","4283":"Now this shortening of the oval circumference is necessarily equal to the opposite optical lengthening (for although this oval is shorter, it nonetheless appears contained within two right angles, or exactly 180 degrees, and is judged to be that long).","4284":"Hence the reader may with good reason doubt  whether in this process it is necessary first to shorten the entire oval, and afterwards to lengthen it again by parts optically.","4285":"For from the diagram it seems apparent that the shortening is at its greatest where the approach towards the center B is greatest, and vice versa.","4286":"If in fact these variations did happen to be equal, the following method for computing the equations would arise.","4287":"The first mean anomaly would be GBD, from which the distance GA would be computed, which, added to AD, the distance of the other end of the preceding from GD (which is always 1\u00b0), and the sum being halved, would give the uniform distance of the arc CD (the same for all its points).","4288":"And we would then say that as the length of the semicircle is to the sum of all the distances on the semicircle, so is this distance of the arc GD to the length of FD, which is the apparent size of CD seen from B. Now from FD, as if it were a measure of the angle CBD, and from AC, AB, we would find the equated anomaly CAD by a shorter path than before.","4289":"But the reader should know that these two variations do not keep in step.","4290":"For the optical amplification which arises from the approach of the path DC to the center B, happens chiefly about the middle elongations, and hardly at all at aphelion and perihelion.","4291":"Contrariwise, the shortening of the oval path, which arises from the incursion of the planet towards the center, is about the same everywhere.","4292":"For two opposite distances at the middle elongations of the eccentric add up to the sum of two near the line of apsides, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.","4293":"But the arcs of the oval circumference are in the inverse ratio of the distances.","4294":"Therefore, two of these arcs, at the middle elongations, will be equal to two other arcs, one near aphelion and the other near perihelion.","4295":"If these arcs of the oval path are equal, the diminution of the arcs at all four places will be approximately equal also.","4296":"This is confirmed by experiment.","4297":"For if the defect of the oval semicircle is 45' 15\", the defect of the 180th part of the oval would be about 14\" about aphelion.","4298":"And the amplification from the approach of the oval does not equal one second at aphelion.","4299":"So, as concerns the proposed ocular estimation of the diagram, it is not quite as simple as was said in the objection, that the shortening of the oval and its optical amplification compensate one another.","4300":"This would indeed be so if all the arcs of the oval path were presented directly when seen from center B. But this happens only at the middle elongations.","4301":"Near the apsides, on the other hand, these arcs are not at the same distance at both ends.","4302":"Therefore, they are not made to be as much greater in their appearance, by approaching, as they are made smaller by being shortened.","4303":"So, following this method, I constructed equations for Mars at all degrees of the eccentric, and I did it three times.","4304":"For the first time I took an eccentricity of 9165 that was not great enough, thinking that I had thus made this very certain through my treatment of the areas.","4305":"And then I used more than 180\u00b0 in the figuring, when I should have used less.","4306":"So, when this last operation showed more than 180\u00b0, which was absurd, for  the second trial I assumed half the oval to be 179\u00b0 14' 15\".","4307":"At a mean anomaly of 45\u00b0, the result was:","4308":"And from this, chiefly from the anomaly of 90\u00b0, I realized that the eccentricity of 9165 was too small.","4309":"This I corrected, using the method presented in passing in the preceding chapter.","4310":"For seeing that at the middle elongations we have 3' 50\" too much in the greatest equations, half of it, 1' 55\", is given to the optical part, and the rest to the physical.","4311":"And since 9165 subtends 5\u00b0 15' 30\", you take 5\u00b0 17' 25\", which yields 9227.","4312":"And so, with a new eccentricity of 9230 (which is hardly different from the 9264 which I found in Ch.","4313":"42, nor is it much farther from 9282, which is half of the eccentricity of the equant in Ch.","4314":"16) I went through the whole job again.","4315":"First, the distances GA or CA were constructed at the individual whole numbers of degrees of equated distance anomaly GAD.","4316":"Next, these were brought over to GD or GBD, the whole number of degrees of mean distance anomaly.","4317":"Third, adjacent pairs, such as GA, AD, were added.","4318":"Fourth, division by those divisors was carried out one hundred eighty times.","4319":"The sum is 358\u00b0 28' 30\", which is the length of the oval path.","4320":"Fifth, the individual arcs of the oval path were added to one another in order.","4321":"Sixth, the optical amplifications were borrowed from the previous unsuccessful operation, since I saw that over two computations they differed hardly at all.","4322":"So these, too were added to the above sum, in order.","4323":"Seventh, the sums of the arcs were increased by the sums of the optical amplifications.","4324":"Eighth, from the angle CBD thus found about the center of the eccentric B, and the distance CA as opposite side, and the eccentricity AB as the third side, I sought out the 180 angles of optical equation ACB, whence the total equations and the equated anomalies were derived.","4325":"The resulting anomalies were:","4326":"So the eccentricity still can be increased, and up above, [moving] from aphelion, the planet is made to be slightly slower than it should be, and the  same near perihelion, and therefore it is swifter than it should be at the middle elongations, as was also found before in Chapter 47.","4327":"So too many of the distances seem to be collected near the apsides, and not as many as required, or not as long as required, about the middle elongations.","4328":"But a consideration of this follows in its proper place.","4329":"So, when I saw that the more skillfully and the more conveniently the physical causes, introduced in Ch.","4330":"45, are called upon for directing the principles of calculation, the closer I always have approached to the true equations provided by the vicarious hypothesis of Ch.","4331":"16, I greatly congratulated myself, and was confirmed in the opinion of Chapter 45.","4332":"On the other hand, since I was revulsed at the multiple contrivances4 with which I contended in this chapter, I did not rest until I had established a more certain and direct way, and at the same time I began to suspect that what the opinion of Chapter 45 had required had in no way been achieved by the calculation.","4333":"Chapter 49","4334":"A critical examination of the previous method for the equations, and a more concise method, based upon the principles constituting the oval in the opinion of Chapter 45.","4335":"So, in order to see the cause of the contrivance1 in this method, now fully presented, consider upon what foundations it rests.","4336":"The planet is supposed to move uniformly on the epicycle, and to be swept around by the sun nonuniformly, according to the distance.","4337":"From these two principles of motion, the oval path arises.","4338":"But this method does not allow one to know what portion of the oval path corresponds to a given time, even if the distance of that portion be known, unless the length of the whole oval be known from the beginning.","4339":"And the length of the oval cannot be known, except through the measure of the incursion of the planet from the circumference of the circle at the sides.","4340":"But further, the measure of this incursion is not known before it is known what portion of the oval path is traversed in any given time.","4341":"This, as you see, begs the question, and in our operation we presupposed what was being sought, namely, the length of the oval.","4342":"This is not just a fault in our understanding, but is utterly alien to the primeval ordainer of the planetary courses: we have hitherto not found such an ungeometrical2 preconception3 in the rest of his works.","4343":"Therefore a different approach must be taken for calling the opinion of Chapter 45 to the calculations, or if this cannot be done, the opinion itself will totter owing to its being suspected of circularity of argument.","4344":"From this consideration the implication has occurred to us that in using the uniform measure of time, we divided the composite oval path into unequal parts, and thus measured out the parts of this composite oval, unequal  but equated again by the compensation of the distances, by the equal increments of time of the planet on all of them.","4345":"And indeed, we had among our presuppositions that only the other power (that which is from the sun), intensifies according to distance, the power proper to the planet doing so not at all.","4346":"But now, in this undertaking, we in a way encumber both forces with this relation to the distances, because we give the common work of the two, the oval, to the planet, according to the measure of the distances to be traversed.","4347":"Therefore, although we have approached rather close to the truth in the effect of this method, we have nothing in which to glory that the opinion of Chapter 45 has been expressed by it if we are abandoned by reason.","4348":"We would therefore have appeared to be going about our business more correctly if, dismissing the composite oval and the quadrature of its area, the subject matter of Chapters 46,47, and 48, we were to convert the calculation to the principles themselves of the oval path, assumed in Chapter 45.","4349":"Let Chapter 45 be taken up again, and about A, the center of the sun's body, with radius AD, let the circle DG of the center of the epicycle be described; and another, with center A, and radius AB, the circle of the aphelion; in which AGB is the line of apsides, and let the planet, when it is at aphelion,4 be at B. Now let some time have passed from when the planet was at B, and let its measure be CDE, the angle on the epicycle, in order that as the aphelion of the epicycle B is translated to C, and the center of the epicycle G to D, the planet will have moved on the epicycle from C to E. Therefore, in order to know the angle DAB at the time CDE, consider that the planet has passed across from B to E by two powers.","4350":"One made it move nearer the sun, and at the same time also drew it away from the line AC or AD, on which it had been previously, when AC was at AB.","4351":"The other moved the planet forward along","4352":"with the center of the epicycle, so that the center D of the epicycle was on the line AC, although it was formerly on AB.","4353":"Now the power that drives the center of the epicycle around in a time designated by 360\u00b0, moves through 360\u00b0, or four right angles, about A, owing to the sum of 360 distances.","4354":"Therefore, the sum of any number of distances being given from the time CDE, as before, the angle DAB will also be given.","4355":"For the impression which the sun makes upon the body of the planet through the mediation of the distances","4356":"AB, AE, is also presumed to make the same impression upon the center of the epicycle GD.","4357":"This is because if the planet had not disengaged itself from the ray of power AB or AC and move towards B, but only descended towards the sun, it would then still be at the point F*  on AC, on which line the center of the epicycle D also lies.","4358":"And it has disengaged itself by the law of the epicycle, at the distance DE and the angle CDE (for this is prescribed by the opinion of Chapter 45, under which we are operating here).","4359":"Thus by a kind of fiction for itself it places the center of its epicycle at D. For we have said in Ch.","4360":"39 how it is to be imagined that the power or fictitious radii of power AB,","4361":"AC, and so on, serve as a position for the planet.","4362":"Now, though, the ratio of the arcs BE of the oval path to the whole oval is not quite the same as the ratio of the corresponding arcs GD of the perfect circle to the whole circle.","4363":"But neither is it true that as BC is to the whole perimeter of the circle BC so is the arc BF of the oval to the whole oval.","4364":"But this should not stand in our way, for BE, and BF too, are composed of two powers, and if anything is disturbed in the proportion this comes from the planet's making its  own descent on the circumference of the epicycle (following the opinion of Chapter 45).","4365":"For if the planet had remained at the highest point of its epicycle, and had been subject to the same motive force from the sun, adumbrated by AB, AE, which is nonuniform (which indeed cannot happen simultaneously, for when the distance of the planet from the sun remains the same, the motive strength from the sun remains the same), then a perfect arc of a greater circle BC would have been described, whose ratio to the whole BC is the same which the arc GD has to the whole GD.","4366":"I am indeed aware that if the planet is supposed to be on a smaller perimeter, that of the center of the epicycle DG, it will go much faster.","4367":"But that is not a reason for assigning a greater speed to the center of the epicycle.","4368":"For, by supposition, the center of the epicycle moves, not in its own right, since it is not a body, but because of the planet.","4369":"It is thus presupposed that the planet moves its own body away from the solar rays according to the law of the epicycle, and makes use of certain rays of power from the sun for its position (ideas which were indeed rejected in Ch.","4370":"39, but taken up again in Ch.","4371":"45 in considerably altered form, and which are retained here in order to explain my attempts).","4372":"On this basis, the foundation of the subsequent calculation is sound, whatever its result might be.","4373":"For the oval is present here no less than before, since DE and AB do not remain parallel.","4374":"For to the extent that the long distances AB, AE exceed the medium distances AG, AD, the arc DG, or the angle DAG, is made less than the angle CDE, the measure of the time.","4375":"Thus DE inclines towards B, and E consequently makes an incursion from the circumference of the circle towards BA.","4376":"For by Chapter 2, if DE had remained parallel to AB, then E would have been on the circumference.","4377":"This gives rise to the following method.","4378":"Let the distances be found for each degree of mean anomaly.","4379":"The method you have in Ch.","4380":"39 above, and I also used it above in Ch.","4381":"47 and 48.","4382":"First, distances are found for nonintegral degrees of mean anomaly, or CE.","4383":"Then, by interpolation, they are carried over to integral degrees of CE.","4384":"If you find this meandering route annoying, and if the greater labor of the direct way pleases you, and if, further, you want to have the whole thing presented in one overview, proceed thus.","4385":"Measure the time, or the artificial units expressing time, which is the astronomers' mean anomaly, on the epicycle CE, from its aphelion C, in a direction opposite the series of signs ^5.","4386":"Thus the angle ADE, or its supplement CDE, is given as a whole number of degrees of mean anomaly.","4387":"The radius AD is also given as 100,000, and the radius of the epicycle DE is 9264.","4388":"Therefore, part of the equation, DAE, will be given, and the distance AE.","4389":"Put both of these into a catalog, with the mean anomaly CE adjoined, for future use.","4390":"In this manner, let all the distances AE be gathered and added, and the sum will be found to be about 36,075,562.","4391":"For this sum was found using an eccentricity only slightly different from our present one, which is 9264.","4392":"The 360th part of this has the value 100,210, and the same fraction of four right angles is one degree.","4393":"Therefore, as each of the distances, in order, is to the distance 100,210, so is the arc of this distance 100,210 (60\u2019) to the arcs belonging to the other distances.","4394":"For, as was frequently announced in Ch.","4395":"39, 47, and 48, the ratio is inverse.","4396":"Next, multiplying 60 minutes, or 3600 seconds, by 100,210, and dividing the product by each of the distances in the semicircle, 180 times, or  better, by half the sum of adjacent pairs of distances (following the advice given in Ch.","4397":"48), yields the angles of the center of the epicycle, DAG.","4398":"Next, beginning from the two least values of DAG, add them, and to the sum add the third, and again add the fourth to the sum of the three preceding, and so on, until you have accumulated all the 180 degrees.","4399":"And if your final sum comes out to be exactly 180\u00b0 it will prove to you that you did everything right, never departing from the instructions.","4400":"And let these sums of yours, which are the angles DAG, again be inscribed in a catalog with the corresponding mean anomalies in the margin, for ready reference.","4401":"So, since an integral equation is to be computed, that is, the equated anomaly for a given mean anomaly, first, with the mean anomaly CDE measured on the epicycle, you extract the angle DAG or CAB from the latter catalog, the one with the sum of the angles.","4402":"And with the same mean anomaly, you also extract the part of the equation CAE from the previous catalog.","4403":"And when this is subtracted from the angle DAB, the remainder is the equated anomaly EAB.","4404":"The variations in the other semicircle are known.","4405":"In this manner, at 6","4406":"Near the apsides the planet is made to be slower than it should be, and near the middle elongations swifter than it should be.","4407":"You will say that we have come out worse, since in Ch.","4408":"48 we came nearer the truth in our results.","4409":"But, my good man, if I were concerned with results, I could have avoided all this work, being content with the vicarious hypothesis.","4410":"Be it known, therefore, that these errors are going to be our path to the truth.","4411":"Meanwhile, let us be assured that at last we have brought the physical causes, which we supposed in Chapter 45, at least once to a calculation entirely free of error.","4412":"At the same time, moreover, the calculation of Chapter 47, above, is confirmed, since this one is equivalent; and it is certain that what we held in suspicion there as ungeometrical,7 have not obstructed us in any perceptible way.","4413":"Thus if there remains any discrepancy between these equalities and the truth, it is to be attributed, not to the method of applying numbers, but to the opinion of Ch.","4414":"45, whence these numbers flow.","4415":"This is to say, not that the opinion itself has immediately become totally false, but just that we have been hasty.","4416":"For instead of waiting for the plenary judgement of the observations, when we understood the planet's path to be oval we immediately seized upon  a certain quality for that oval, solely on account of the elegance of the physical causes and the graceful uniformity of the epicyclic motion, which was falsely given credence.","4417":"Now the manner in which the ultimate and truest opinion is to be brought to a calculation, and made to conform most closely to these chapters, will be told in its place.","4418":"*  I am now going to complete the unfolding of my remaining trials.","4419":"Chapter 50","4420":"On six other ways by which an attempt was made to construct the eccentric equations.","4421":"How small a heap of grain we have gathered from this threshing!","4422":"But you also see what a huge cloud of husks there is now.","4423":"They ought to have been hauled back to the beginning of Ch.","4424":"48, since before I investigated the arcs of the oval path I would have dealt with them.","4425":"But for the sake of bringing light, it was appropriate to winnow them.","4426":"Besides, we might end up finding a few useful grains.","4427":"In the first and second method, the procedure was this","4428":"First, with eccentricity 9165, which is a little less than the correct value, I sought out all the distances, according to the procedure shown in Chapter 29.","4429":"These corresponded to integral degrees of an anomaly occupying a middle position between the mean anomaly and the true equated anomaly.","4430":"Although I am calling it \"equated\" for the time being, I nevertheless add a condition, that it be used only for the distances.","4431":"I therefore name it \"anomaly of distance\".","4432":"*  In the second diagram of Chapter 46 it is the angle FAB, and in the following one, CAD.","4433":"Second, I sought out the third proportional lines, each of which was to its distance as this distance was to the radius, 100,000.","4434":"Third and fourth, I added the lines so found one by one,1 and the sum of the distances was 35,924,252, less than 36,000,000.","4435":"The cause of this you have in Chapter 40.","4436":"But the sum of the proportional lines was  found to be 36,000,000, which holds me in wonder.","4437":"And because it is delightful, I wish some geometer would prove it to be necessary ^2.","4438":"About centers A, B let two equal circles IH and DC be described, and let the centers A, B be joined, and AB extended so as to intersect the circle about A at I and K and the circle about B at D and L. Then let the circle about A be di","4439":"vided into any number of equal parts, such as 360, beginning from I. And from A let lines AI, AH, AK, and so on, be drawn through the points of division I, \u0397, K, and so on, intersecting the circle about B at the points D, C, L. Then let it be that as AI is to AD, so is AD to AG; and as AH is to AC, so is AC to AF; and finally, as AK is  to AL, so is AL to AM; and so on for all the rest.","4440":"Let, I say, a geometer demonstrate that the sum of the last 360, AG, AF, AM, joined together, is equal to the sum of the first 360, AI, AH, AK, joined together.","4441":"So, in this first method using the sums of the distances, I intended one thing (although erroneously and irrelevantly, namely, to add up the arcs CD or angles CBD, even though they were given at the beginning), but accomplished another, again erroneously.","4442":"For I obtained, not the arcs, nor the angles, nor the path lengths, but the times on the unequal arcs of the planet's path, as if they were equal.","4443":"And, following the rule of proportion, I said that as the sum of the means, AD, AE, AL, which is 35,924,252, is to the elapsed time of 360\u00b0, so is the sum of any number of distances to its elapsed time over the length of the path that includes these distances.","4444":"Let A be the sun, B the center of the eccentric CD, BC the semidiameter.","4445":"Let B, A be joined to C. Here the distances CA were found corresponding to integral degrees of the angle CAD, and thus to unequal arcs on the circle CD, something that escaped my notice.","4446":"So let CAD be 45\u00b0.","4447":"From CB, BA, the angle CBD is given as 48\u00b0 42' 59\".","4448":"Therefore, if there were no physical cause of the equation, and CBD were the measure of the time or mean anomaly, then there would correspond to it this value for CAD, truly equated.","4449":"But the planet is slower on CD, owing to its greater distance from A, and the distances are the measure of the elapsed time.","4450":"Therefore, at the anomaly CAD of 45\u00b0 I collected 45 distances at the beginning of the arcs, which are longer.","4451":"Their sum was 4,869,307.","4452":"I also collected 45 shorter ones, the ones at the ends of the arcs, by subtracting the longest, AD, 109,165, from the sum of the 46 distances, 4,975,577.","4453":"The remainder was 4,866,412.","4454":"The mean between the two sums, 4,867,852, I reduced to degrees, where 35,924,252 have the value 360\u00b0, or 99,790 have the value 1\u00b0.","4455":"The result of this procedure was 48\u00b0 46' 51\".","4456":"And this ought to have been the time corresponding to the angle CAD.","4457":"But the arc CD or the angle CBD was also found to be about that much, 48\u00b0 42' 51\".","4458":"This is absurd, and contrary to the hypothesis, which requires the planet to be slower at CD.","4459":"The cause of this absurdity was immediately clear, namely, that in order to know the elapsed time for CD it would have been proper to take the distances corresponding to equal arcs of CD, while these distances just taken correspond to unequal arcs of CD, and are greater to the extent that the distances themselves are longer, by Ch.","4460":"32.","4461":"Therefore, these distances had too small a numerical value.","4462":"Nevertheless, in order that I not lose all this labor, I subtracted the excess of this number of the elapsed time over the number of the angle CAD, from CAD, so as to leave as a remainder EAD, 41\u00b0 13' 9\", and so that AC, AE might be equal.","4463":"Here it was supposed that in the time CBD the planet traverses an angle EBD about the center of the eccentric B equal to CAD, and therefore, that as many distances from A were collected for the equal arcs ED of its eccentric as we found here on equal degrees of CAD.","4464":"Thus, the same number of arcs which, in this calculation of ours, were spread out over CD, which were unequal and, in this locality, too great, are now understood to be compacted within the confines of arc ED,  now divided into equal parts.","4465":"Therefore, the angle CBD would here be the mean anomaly of distance, giving the angle CAD, for finding the distances CA, from which the angle CAE, the physical slowing and translation of CA to EA, is deduced.","4466":"Although it cannot show much of a discrepancy from the prior method of Chapter 49, this procedure assumes without demonstration that CAD and  EBD are equal, and consequently, that CA and EB are parallel, which was refuted above in the second diagram of Ch.","4467":"46.","4468":"But now see how close this operation comes in its results.","4469":"For","4470":"The eccentricity was charged with being too small, and indeed, it really is greater, 9264 instead of 9165.","4471":"Also, the planet was made to go too slowly near the apsides, and too fast near the middle elongations.","4472":"But, dismissing this first method, which we seized upon by chance in thinking over the error committed at the beginning, let us turn to the implementation of the second method, born from a consideration of the same error.","4473":"The distances scattered over CAD had approximately the same numerical value as the sector CBD, and led the argument to an absurdity (for just as the area CAD, an approximate measure of the distances, is greater than the area of the sector CBD, the numerical value of the distances CD also had to have been greater than the sector CBD).","4474":"The question therefore followed: did the lines AF, AG proportional to AC, AD correctly express the elapsed time over CD, thus allowing CAD to remain the true equated anomaly?","4475":"The answer is, they did not.","4476":"For if so, AC will remain in its place, which is the same at which its length was computed.","4477":"Therefore, the orbit will be a perfect circle, which was refuted in Ch.","4478":"44.","4479":"Therefore, the distances at the middle elongations, coming out longer than they should be, will make the planet slower than it should be there, and hence it will be faster at the apsides.","4480":"But look at the result of the operation, which testifies to this itself.","4481":"For","4482":"First, the eccentricity is charged with being too small, since the maximum equation comes out to be 10\u00b0 29\u2155\u2019, which is 10\u00b0 34\u00bd\u2019 in the vicarious hypothesis.","4483":"Second, at the time 52\u00b0 39\u2154\u2019 the planet is found to have traversed as much of its path from the apsis as was traversed in the vicarious in the longer time of 52\u00b0 53'.","4484":"If the eccentricity were adjusted, all the values of the equated anomaly would be increased, so that, in the lower quadrant also, in the time of 37\u00b0 44' (the supplement of 142\u00b0 16', which has been adjusted by increasing the eccentricity), the planet will traverse as much of the path as it traverses in the vicarious in the longer time of 37\u00b0 51', which is the supplement of 142\u00b0 9': that is, both will traverse 45\u00b0, which is the supplement of 135\u00b0.","4485":"By the way, this false hypothesis has come very close to giving us true results: the difference, after correction, is not more than 8' or 7' at either place.","4486":"You thus see that results must not be trusted.","4487":"And you will note again what  was observed in Ch.","4488":"47, that the truth lies at the midpoint between these two methods (the latter of which describes a perfect circle, and the former an oval, following the opinion of Ch.","4489":"45).","4490":"Therefore, you can at least conclude now, as well as before in Ch.","4491":"47, that the lunules to be cut off from the perfect circle have only half the breadth of the one that follows from the opinion of Ch.","4492":"45.","4493":"Third and fourth method","4494":"So, since this second method did not accord with reason either, and in the first I learned that the distances are to be sought out corresponding to integral degrees of the angle CBD or to equal arcs of the eccentric CD, I also proceeded to the distances.","4495":"So, fifth (I am enumerating for you only those operations each of which is performed 180 times), I made use of interpolation to relate the distances found previously by dividing the mean anomalies CBD minutewise, or unequally, to the mean anomalies which are equal or are of an integral number of degrees.","4496":"But now, CBD no longer remained the [mean] anomaly, as it formerly was in the first method, but was made the eccentric anomaly by this relating of the distances, as it also is in the second method.","4497":"Sixth, using the same distances as before, I sought out their proportionals, that is, the lines that are to the distances as the distances are to the radius, 100,000.","4498":"But this was unnecessary.","4499":"Still, I wanted to be aware of all the possibilities.","4500":"Seventh and eighth, I again added the individual magnitudes, both of the distances AD, AC, and of their proportionals AG, AF.","4501":"The sum of the distances came out to be 36,075,562.","4502":"The reason for its coming out greater than 36,000,000 you have in Ch.","4503":"40.","4504":"The sum of the proportionals came out to 36,384,621.","4505":"Now, in the previous diagram, we shall proceed demonstratively, using the equated anomaly CAD to obtain the eccentric anomaly CBD, and further, through this eccentric anomaly CBD learning the sum of the distances found on the arc CD.","4506":"And by this sum of the distances, we shall obtain the elapsed time over the arc CD, or the mean anomaly.","4507":"Or, in reverse order, for convenience's sake, if an angle CBD of an integral number of degrees (such as 45\u00b0) is used to find CAB, and 45 correct distances are obtained, these things, I say, follow demonstratively.","4508":"But again, as before in the second method, CAD becomes the true equated anomaly, and thus CA remains in place, and the orbit DC will be a perfect circle.","4509":"Since this is false, as was shown in Ch.","4510":"44, it necessarily follows that the distances at the middle elongations are taken to be too long here, and consequently that the times are made longer than they should be, and shorter at the apsides.","4511":"This method will in all respects be almost exactly equivalent to the previous method, using proportionals.","4512":"For the number of distances we have gathered is now greater than before, to about the same extent that the proportionals, the same in number as the distances, were longer than the distances then.","4513":"But, for safety's sake, witness the result of this calculation.","4514":"For","4515":"The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be.","4516":"In other  respects, the errors are the same as in the preceding one.","4517":"The reason why the signs for excess are turned into signs for defect, is that here the difference shows errors in the equated anomaly, while there they are in the mean anomaly.","4518":"And this is the third method.","4519":"In substituting the proportionals AG, AF for the distances AD, AC, which is the fourth method, we are going to make the two parts of the equation into three.","4520":"For the area CAD measures the sum of the distances CA, DA.","4521":"It is therefore much less than the sum of the lines FA, GA.","4522":"And even if we attempt a remedy like the one used on the first method, we shall still have doubled our errors.","4523":"For since the distances themselves cannot be admitted, owing to their excessive length at the middle elongations, the proportionals will be even less tolerable, since they are longer.","4524":"And if you want to test them with the results of a calculation, you will find that to a mean anomaly of 53\u00b0 23' 56\" there corresponds an equated anomaly of 46\u00b0 0', which in the vicarious hypothesis comes out to be about 45\u00b0 27', a difference of 33', clearly absurd.","4525":"Fifth and sixth method","4526":"So, since I accomplished nothing with these four methods, I then took the mean anomaly and the distances assigned to it (in the fifth operation) and went over to the table of the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16, and the true equated anomaly.","4527":"Let the second diagram in Chapter 46 be taken up again.","4528":"Then, the distances AF belonging to integral degrees of mean anomaly IBF or IDH, also belong to the degrees and minutes of the equated anomaly IAH, which in the table mentioned corresponded to the mean anomaly IDH itself.","4529":"Therefore,","4530":"Ninth, I related these distances obtained from the minutewise equated anomalies of the vicarious hypothesis of Ch.","4531":"16, that is, from the unequal angles HAI, to the individual integral degrees of the equated anomaly HAI, that is, to equal parts.","4532":"Tenth, with the same distances, thus set up, I sought the [third] proportionals, as in the second and sixth operations.","4533":"Eleventh and twelfth, I added each, according to its kind, and the sum of the distances was 35,770,014, and the sum of the proportionals, 35,692,048.","4534":"In this translation of distances we moved all the long ones upwards, and made them fewer, establishing large arcs IG of the oval path above, at aphelion, and thus attributing the individual distances to the individual degrees, not of the anomaly FAB, as in the first method, but of HAB, which is the true equated anomaly.","4535":"There are no more of these degrees in the upper semicircle than in the lower.","4536":"Therefore, there are now more of the short distances than there are of the long ones, whence it not only happens that the sum of the 360 distances comes out smaller than the sum of the 360 diameters, but also the sum of the proportionals comes out smaller than was the sum of the distances themselves.","4537":"So, in the matter of the fifth method and the sums of the distances,  reason again cries out against the method of basing equations upon it.","4538":"Let the diagram belonging to this chapter be repeated, and let it be recalled to mind what was said about the first method.","4539":"For in it the equated anomaly of distance CAD was divided into equal degrees.","4540":"Hence it happened that CD was divided into unequal and [excessively] large parts, and had too few distances.","4541":"From this, seizing upon a sort of accidental remedy for the error, we concluded from the sum of the distances on CD that to those distances belonged a shorter arc ED, so as to transfer AC over to AE, and thus ED could be obtained divided into equal parts with a distance established at any of its degrees.","4542":"However, it was not from the sum of the distances found on CD, but from a mingling of the vicarious hypothesis with the hypothesis of the distances framed in Chapter 46, that the translation of AC to AE was now made and perfected, and the arc ED was attributed to the mean anomaly (which we have numbered on the  arc CD for finding the distance CA or EA).","4543":"And this was nonetheless done in such a way that BE and AC are not exactly parallel, as in the first method.","4544":"And now that this has been done by a mingling of hypotheses, as I was saying, there is no need to go through the operation again, as in the first method.","4545":"Instead, only one thing needs to be found: do the few distances AC, AE gathered into one sum in this fifth method, produce the same physical equation that resulted artificially from the two mingled hypotheses?","4546":"Consider here how the distances are arranged in this last procedure.","4547":"The angle EAD, whose terminus E is at distance AC from the sun, was divided into equal degrees in this last procedure, to each of which was given a distance.","4548":"In this way the arc ED of the oval path standing upon the angle EAD ends up divided into unequal parts, and it receives too few distances.","4549":"So the mean anomaly already given from the vicarious hypothesis cannot be had from the sum of the distances on EAD.","4550":"Now in the first method above, when CD received too few distances, with the angle CAD divided into equal degrees we substituted ED for CD as the arc suited to those distances.","4551":"So similarly, in this fifth method, since ED has received too few distances, with the angle EAD divided into equal degrees, if it is permissible again to make use of a clumsy remedy, we would substitute ND for ED, as the arc to which those distances belong.","4552":"In order to find the distance CA let the mean anomaly CBD be 48\u00b0 44'.","4553":"Given angle B, and CB, BA, CA is given as 105,784,3 and CAB as 45\u00b0.","4554":"The vicarious hypothesis requires AC to be transferred to AE.","4555":"And we now divide ED, which the vicarious hypothesis declares to be 41\u00b0 22', into equal degrees, and through them we collected no more than 41 distances and part of a 42nd.","4556":"And these, gathered into a single sum, will constitute a mean anomaly which is by no means equal to the one first taken, DC, but is equal to another, DO, which shows the distance AO, to be transferred to AN.","4557":"\"Work was begun on an amphora; why has a pitcher come forth from the whirling wheel?","4558":"\"4 For the question was whether all the distances on the equal degrees of ED, gathered into a sum, would show the mean anomaly DC.","4559":"But the operation gave me an answer concerning ND, and the anomaly DO.","4560":"Finally, let us turn to the sixth method, and the proportionals that are  adapted to the demonstration of Ch.","4561":"32.","4562":"For the true quantities of orbital arcs that appear equal from the center of the sun are in the ratio of the distances: thus to the extent that AE is longer, so is ED.","4563":"But the times of truly equal arcs, as measured on the orbit, are also in the ratio of the distances.","4564":"For to the extent that ED is farther away from A, the planet also takes longer to traverse the arc ED.","4565":"Therefore, the times that the planet accumulates on those arcs that appear equal from the center of the sun, are in the duplicate ratio of the distances.","4566":"But AF is to AH likewise in the duplicate ratio of the distance AC or AE to the mean AH.","4567":"And so the measures of the times that the planet accumulates over equal degrees of the angle EAD are the proportional lines AG, AF, belonging to the integral degrees or equal parts of the angle of true equated anomaly EAD.","4568":"Therefore, let the proportionals to the distances at equal degrees of equated anomaly be tested, just as other distances were also tested above in this chapter.","4569":"As, since 35,692,048, the sum of all 360 distances, at all 360 equal parts of the angle at the sun, is equivalent to an elapsed time of 360\u00b0, what is the value of a just and correct sum at any given degree of equated anomaly?","4570":"In this manner is found","4571":"The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be.","4572":"With  this corrected, the difference above, at 41\u00b0, will be about 8'+, and below, about 7\u00bd\u2019\u2014.","4573":"Thus here, too, the planet is not made to go fast enough at the apsides, and so there are too many distances near the apsides, and consequently less than there should be at the middle elongations.","4574":"But it comes quite close to the truth, and clearly coincides with the method of Chapter 49.","4575":"For if you consider well, the same thing is done here as was done in Ch.","4576":"49.","4577":"There we computed the optical part of the equation by itself, and the physical part also by itself, while here we are computing them both together.","4578":"There we had introduced fictitious rays of power in order to be able also to ascribe to the epicycle its own task of disengaging itself from those fictitious rays (for in the truth of the matter no rays go around as slowly as the center of the planetary epicycle goes, as was said in Ch.","4579":"39).","4580":"And nevertheless, we left all the physical force carrying the planet around (as concerns the effect) to the sun, so that the epicycle would only serve to adjust the distances.","4581":"Here, we made use of the same power of the sun for the physical translation, while we again computed the distances from the epicycle, and gave its equal parts to equal times, that is, to equal degrees of mean anomaly, as the opinion of Ch.","4582":"45 maintains.","4583":"And if we ended up taking as many distances in any given part of the time as there are degrees of equated anomaly, they are still derived from the distances of the mean anomaly, and in length they are the same.","4584":"And this form is so much easier that we can here put  aside the other persuasion concerning the planet's epicyclic motion, and take one step closer to the truth of the physical cause, leaving to the epicyclic mode nothing but a reciprocation on the diameter\u2014although this is still flawed, as has was clear from these equations, at least.","4585":"For, as was noted just above in considering the second method, this preoccupation with epicyclic motion is excessive, showing distances at the middle elongations that are too small, from which it happens that at that place the planet exceeds its measure of velocity, and at the apsides falls short of its measure.","4586":"But it suffices us to express the opinion of Ch.","4587":"45 in our calculation.","4588":"Therefore, although one might here raise the objection from Ch.","4589":"32 that this ratio of diurnal motions cannot be constant, since the parts of the eccentric near the apsides are presented directly to the sun, and the intermediate are presented obliquely, so that they thus appear differently from the way they would if they were presented directly\u2014 if anyone, I say, were to raise this objection, I shall answer as I did in Ch.","4590":"49, that this obliquity at the intermediate parts is added by the planet in its own right, and is produced through its descent.","4591":"Thus, it is not to be imputed to the motive cause arising from the sun, nor is it affected by that cause.","4592":"Therefore, studious reader, from such a great number of chapters and methods, you have only two methods of equating that conform to the opinion of Ch.","4593":"45.","4594":"One is by the physical hypothesis intermingled with an epicycle set up on the longitude, described in Ch.","4595":"49.","4596":"The other is by this chapter, and its sixth method, in accordance with a more purely physical hypothesis, where the epicycle governs nothing but the descent towards the sun, or if anyone should wish to set it up to affect the latitude, [the epicycle should be] perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.","4597":"And both of these two use different means to produce the same effect.","4598":"You will thus be able to place confidence in them more safely when examining the opinion of Chapter 45.","4599":"And through a hitherto empty trust in the true physical causes that have been discovered, let a triumph over Mars once again be celebrated.","4600":"Now, some rumor, I know not what, calls me to new tumults and new labors ^5.","4601":"Chapter 51","4602":"Distances of Mars from the sun are explored and compared, at an equal distance from aphelion on either semicircle; and at the same time the trustworthiness of the vicarious hypothesis is explored.","4603":"While I am thus celebrating a triumph over the motions of Mars, and fetter him in the prison of tables and the leg-irons of eccentric equations, considering him utterly defeated, it is announced in various places that the victory is futile, and war is breaking out again with full force.","4604":"For while the enemy was in the house as a captive, and hence lightly esteemed, he burst all the chains of the equations and broke out of the prison of the tables.","4605":"That is, no method administered geometrically under the rule of the opinion of Ch.","4606":"45 was able to emulate in numerical accuracy the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16 (which has true equations derived from false causes).","4607":"Outdoors, meanwhile, spies positioned throughout the whole circuit of the eccentric\u2014I mean the true distances\u2014have overthrown my troops of physical causes called forth from Ch.","4608":"45, and have  shaken off their yoke, retaking liberty.","4609":"And now there was not much to prevent the fugitive enemy's joining forces with his fellow rebels and reducing me to desperation, unless I had sent new reinforcements of physical reasoning in a hurry to the scattered, straggling veterans, and, informed with all diligence, had stuck to the trail without delay in the direction whither the captive had fled.","4610":"In the following few chapters, I shall be telling of both these campaigns in the order in which they were waged.","4611":"And, to speak initially of the first of these, I shall begin by seeking out the distances of several places on the eccentric where the evidence is most trustworthy.","4612":"Therefore, let it be our intention to explore the distances near the mean anomaly of 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0.","4613":"On 1589 May 6 at 11\u2153h Mars was observed at 27\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 Libra with latitude  0\u00b0 6\u2154\u2019 north ^1.","4614":"The true position of the sun at this time is calculated as 25\u00b0 48\u2154\u2018 Taurus, and its distance from earth 101,361.","4615":"The mean longitude of Mars was 7s 26\u00b0 0' 36\", and therefore its eccentric position was 15\u00b0 32' 13\" Scorpio.","4616":"But our vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16 did not come nearer than 2\u2153\u2018 the true or observed position of Mars in an acronychal situation, and thus in so sensitive a procedure the computation of the equated anomaly cannot be trusted.","4617":"Therefore, to the method of Chapters 27, 28, and 42 I shall add another observation, which nevertheless uses a freer method.","4618":"Indeed, as I remarked in Ch.","4619":"12 above, Mars was not very often observed twice in this region.","4620":"Therefore, we should be content with two observations.","4621":"For with this  one just now presented, there is associated another, from 1594 December 28.","4622":"At 7\u00bch on the morning of that day, Mars's mean longitude is calculated to be 7s 26\u00b0 13' 39\",2 a few minutes beyond the other.","4623":"And at that time Mars, at an altitude of eight or nine degrees, was observed to be 50\u00b0 34' from Spica Virginis.","4624":"So, since it stood very close to the ecliptic, in the right triangle between Spica, its ecliptic position, and Mars, the base is given as 50\u00b0 34' and the side between Spica and the ecliptic is 1\u00b0 59', which is Spica's latitude.","4625":"Therefore, the remaining side is 50\u00b0 32' 18\".","4626":"Thus, since Spica was at 18\u00b0 11' Libra, Mars fell at 8\u00b0 43' 18\" Sagittarius.","4627":"The declination of this position from the equator was 21\u00b0 50' 20\" [S.","4628":"].","4629":"However, Mars was found to have a declination of 21\u00b0 41' [S.].","4630":"Therefore, it displayed a small amount of north latitude, 9' 20\".","4631":"And on the following 1595 January 4 it still had 3' of north latitude ^3.","4632":"Our observation is hereby confirmed.","4633":"But if you assume this to be the true latitude of Mars, its ecliptic position will not be changed perceptibly.","4634":"So you may safely pronounce its position to be 8\u00b0 43' Sagittarius.","4635":"And because Mars was near the sun, it was very far from earth, and thus had a much smaller parallax than the sun, which we shall ignore.","4636":"But  we cannot similarly ignore the refraction, which I shall now remove.","4637":"For the sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 47' 10\" Capricorn, distance from earth 98,232, and its right ascension was 288\u00b0 12'.","4638":"Therefore, 306\u00b0 57' on the equator was rising, and along with it 29\u00b0 Sagittarius,4 at which the angle between the ecliptic and the horizon is 26\u00b0, its complement 64\u00b0.","4639":"And because the altitudinal refraction as shown by the table of refractions of the fixed stars is 6' 30\", and from the table of the sun, 11', when the star is at an altitude of 8\u00bd\u00b0, 5' 51\" or 9' 53\" are to be subtracted from the latitude.","4640":"The latitude from the former would be 3' 29\" N., and from the latter 0' 33\" S. And the longitudinal refraction is 2' 39\" or 4' 34\" ^5.","4641":"Of these two methods of determining the refraction, I shall follow the one which is confirmed by the latitudes, as  follows.","4642":"In the earlier observation, the observed latitude was 6\u2154 North.","4643":"And because Mars was near the earth, and the angle at the sun was 10\u00b0 17', while at the earth it was 28\u00b0 41', this latitude requires an  inclination of 2' 30\".","4644":"Therefore, in our later observation the inclination will also be 2' 30\", or a little less, since we are 8' closer to the node.","4645":"But with the inclination assumed to be 2' 30\", since here the angle at the sun is 61\u00b0, and at earth 38\u00b0, a latitude of about 1' 50\" N. must follow, as indicated by our parallactic table ^6.","4646":"But by using the refraction of the fixed stars, we were left with a latitude of 3' 29\" N., while by using the solar refraction we were moved down to 0\u00b0 33' S. Thus in the second our refraction was greater than would be correct, and in the first, less.","4647":"So the correct refraction is between the two, namely, 3' 36\".","4648":"That is, for us Mars will be put at 8\u00b0 46\u2153\u2018 Sagittarius.","4649":"Let O be the sun, B and A points on the earth\u2019s orbit, A the position of the earth in the earlier observation, B in the later, M Mars.","4650":"Let the lines be connected.","4651":"And although Mars does not return to exactly the same place, let it nonetheless be represented in both instances by the line OM.","4652":"Thus MAO is 28\u00b0 41' 14\", and AO is 101,365.","4653":"Let MO, the distance of Mars from the sun (which is being sought here), be taken as if known, and let it be 154,200.","4654":"Thus OM will fall at 15\u00b0 31' 3\" Scorpio.","4655":"And if OM is assumed to be 154,200 in the earlier observation, it ought to be taken as shorter in the later one.","4656":"Now one degree at this place on the eccentric changes the distance by 240 units, whatever form you use for constructing the distances ^7.","4657":"Therefore, since the mean longitudes here differ by 13 minutes, and when a subtraction is made to account for precession, only eight, the proportional part of 240 is 32.","4658":"Consequently, in the second observation, we have assumed OM to be 154,168.","4659":"But OBM is also known, it being 38\u00b0 0' 40\", and OB is 98,232.","4660":"Therefore, OMB is given as 23\u00b0 6' 11\".","4661":"Consequently, on the second occasion OM was at 15\u00b0 40' 9\" Scorpio, differing from the earlier eccentric position by 9 minutes.","4662":"It should have differed by somewhat more.","4663":"For the mean anomalies differed by 8' 3\", to which corresponds 7' 49\" in the equated anomaly of the eccentric at this place.","4664":"Add to these the intervening precession of the equinoxes of 4' 48\".","4665":"Thus 12' 37\" are accumulated.","4666":"Mars therefore ought to fall at 15\u00b0 43' 40\" Scorpio.","4667":"Therefore, we should take a somewhat different value for the distance OM, and should change it so that the lines represented by OM move about another 2\u2154\u2018 apart from each other.","4668":"For when the earth is at A, OM should move back in longitude, and forward when the earth is at B. But this occurs if you increase OM.","4669":"So let it be 154,400 in the first instance, and in the second, 154,368.","4670":"For then OM falls first at 15\u00b0 29' 34\" Scorpio, and second at 15\u00b0 42' 18\" Scorpio.","4671":"And for the first time the mean anomaly is 87\u00b0 9' 24\", and 87\u00b0 16' 30\"8 for the second.","4672":"This will do for the mean longitude of the earlier one.","4673":"For the other mean longitude, an observation in the month of December  1595 will serve, being well supported by the consensus of a number of consecutive days, and at a place where the vicarious hypothesis also exactly represented the acronychal position of Mars in the preceding October.","4674":"For the sake of consensus, we shall also add an observation of October 1597.","4675":"In the other years it was not observed at this eccentric position.","4676":"For the eccentric position falls at 10\u00b0 Gemini.","4677":"Thus Mars was observed last at this place in  November 1580 ^9.","4678":"In 1582 its arrival at the place fell in October, when [Tycho's] great interest in observing was not yet aroused.","4679":"In 1584 it came in September, in 1586 in July, in 1588 in June, in 1590 in April, and in 1592 in March, at which times, being near the sun owing to the short, bright nights in Denmark, it was neglected, while, whenever there was an opportunity, they were intent upon the fixed stars, the moon, and the other planets.","4680":"But at the end of 1593 and the beginning of 1594, when it was at quadrature with the sun, the observation was not continued beyond this aspect because astronomers are usually chiefly interested in the quadrature.","4681":"So, in 1595 Dec.","4682":"17 at 7h 6m in the evening the planet was observed at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, with latitude 1\u00b0 40' 44\" N ^10.","4683":"The sun's position was 5\u00b0 39' 3\" Capricorn.","4684":"Its distance from earth was 98,200.","4685":"The mean longitude of Mars is concluded to be 2s 2\u00b0 4' 22\".","4686":"And since the aphelion is 4s 28\u00b0 58' 10\", the distance of the position from aphelion is 86\u00b0 53' 48\" backwards.","4687":"Previously, it was nearly the same as that, namely, 87\u00b0 9' 24\".","4688":"Therefore, these two positions are nearly the same distance from aphelion.","4689":"Now from our vicarious hypothesis, there corresponds to this simple anomaly an equated anomaly of 76\u00b0 25' 48\".","4690":"Which, subtracted from the position of the aphelion, leaves Mars's eccentric position, 12\u00b0 32' 22\" Gemini.","4691":"Let A be the earth, O the sun, M Mars.","4692":"AO is given as 98,200.","4693":"And because OM is at 12\u00b0 32' 22\" Gemini, while AM is at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, therefore AMO is 31\u00b0 0' 55\".","4694":"And because AO is at 5\u00b0 39' 3\" Capricorn, while AM is at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, therefore, the supplement of OAM is 54\u00b0 7' 36\".","4695":"Hence, since the sine of OAM is to OM as the sine of AMO is to AO, OM comes out to be 154,432.","4696":"And since this position is 15 minutes closer to the apogee than the one from 1589, and at this position on the eccentric 1\u00b0 causes a change of 240 units, therefore 60 units are to be subtracted for 15 minutes, since at positions farther removed from aphelion the distances are shorter.","4697":"The distance thus comes out to be 154,372.","4698":"On the other hand, since the node is at about 16\u00b0 20' Taurus, and the eccentric position is 12\u00b0 32' Gemini, the planet is 26\u00b0 12' from the node.","4699":"And the maximum inclination of the planes is 1\u00b0 50'.","4700":"Therefore, the inclination at this place is 48' 32\".","4701":"The secant of this exceeds the radius by 10 units, or in our dimensions, 15\u00bd.","4702":"So the distance of the actual point on Mars's orbit from the sun is 154,387.","4703":"And previously, at this distance from aphelion it was found to be approximately 154,400 from the sun.","4704":"Therefore, the distances of these two points on the eccentric from the sun is equal to within a hair's breadth.","4705":"For the 13 units that are wanting in the latter distance are of no importance.","4706":"I shall rejoice if I am able to come within an uncertainty of 100 units everywhere.","4707":"And now I shall add [the observation from] 1597, not so much to confirm the previous ones, which are certain in themselves, as to give the reader an opportunity to compare the observations of Tycho with the observations of others, by which means he will at length understand how much that man has benefited us.","4708":"There do indeed exist observations of that author from the last days of October of 1597,11 but they were taken with a radius while travelling, and not brought to a calculation by the author himself, who knew how to correct distances taken with a radius, by applying a kind of parallactic table for the eye, as he informed us in the Progymnasmata.","4709":"And so, since very different distances are ascribed to the same moment (possibly because they were supposed to be corrected immediately after the observations), they are to be dismissed.","4710":"But at the same moment, I, though absent in Styria, made an observation, and (strange to say) did so with the eyes of Tycho Brahe, standing by the shore of the Baltic Sea.","4711":"Here is the series of observations\u2014can you hold your laughter, friends?12","4712":"On 1597 November 8, Saturday, or October 29, in the morning, Mars was  not yet on the line from the twelfth of Gemini to the fourth ^13.","4713":"On the following day, it had already left it: it was nearer the ninth than the twelfth, and precisely on the line from 11 to 9, and also on the line from 1 to 5, or a little farther east.","4714":"And the fifth was halfway between the first and Mars.","4715":"From these the position of Mars can be elicited, when certain stellar positions are assumed from Tycho Brahe's catalogue, which I had just now been professing to be my eyes.","4716":"But because the Ninth is not described in Brahe's catalogue (since in its stead in the ninth place is another, distant by more than three degrees from the Ptolemaic, and less than all of them), we shall call upon the latitude of Mars as our counsel.","4717":"For an approximate knowledge of it will suffice.","4718":"Now the mean longitude of Mars on the morning of October 29 at 5h (which is an estimate, since I did not write down the time) is found to be 1s 29\u00b0 10' 43\".","4719":"Therefore, its eccentric position was 9\u00b0 43' Gemini, 23\u00b0 20\u2019 from the node.","4720":"Therefore, the inclination was 43' 52\".","4721":"But the sun was at 15\u00b0 40' Scorpio, and the apparent position of Mars, by anticipation, was about 12\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer.","4722":"Therefore, the latitude was 1\u00b0 36\u2019 24\" ^14.","4723":"Let a computation be made of the longitude of a point on the line from the twelfth to the fourth, having a latitude of 1\u00b0 30\u00bd' North.","4724":"Since the fourth is at 9\u00b0 54' Cancer, latitude 7\u00b0 43' N., and the twelfth is at 12\u00b0 56' Cancer, lat.","4725":"0\u00b0 13\u00bd' S., the longitude of our point, by interpolation, will be 12\u00b0 16' 17\" Cancer.","4726":"But on 29 October, Mars was not yet here, and on the 30th it had already passed it.","4727":"The diurnal motion was no more than 5 minutes, half of which is 2\u00bd', so that on the morning of the 30th it was at 12\u00b0 18\u00bd' Cancer.","4728":"And so indeed it was at the end of 1600, but in 1597 it was at 12\u00b0 16' Cancer.","4729":"Three minutes of error in latitude barely produce one in longitude.","4730":"So the position is certain enough.","4731":"If you also explore it using the first and the fifth, and use the point on that line whose latitude is 1\u00b0 30\u00bd', it falls at 12\u00b0 9' Cancer.","4732":"And Mars was farther east, that is, forward in longitude, at about 12\u00b0 16' or a little before, also intermediate.","4733":"Therefore, the latitude computed by us is confirmed.","4734":"For it should be approximately intermediate, and indeed it is.","4735":"That is, between the Martian latitude of 1\u00b0 30\u00bd' and the 5\u00b0 42\u00bd' of the fifth there is 4\u00b0 12', and between this and the 10\u00b0 2' of the first there is an intermediate 4\u00b0 20'.","4736":"Therefore, let Mars be at 12\u00b0 16' Cancer.","4737":"On 1597 October 30 at 5h am the position of the sun is found to be 16\u00b0 38' 8\" Scorpio, distance 98,820.","4738":"[Mars's] mean longitude was 1s 29\u00b0 42' 10\", aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 57' 10\", supplement of the mean anomaly 89\u00b0 15', of the equated anomaly 78\u00b0 43' 23\", eccentric position 10\u00b0 13' 47\" Gemini.","4739":"Therefore, a distance of 153,753 is called forth from these.","4740":"And since we are 2\u00b0 6' lower from aphelion than before, we will add twice 240, the sum of the units corresponding to one degree:","4741":"If you subtract three minutes from the position of Mars, so that it would be at 12\u00b0 13' Cancer, which could be done in our observation, especially if the time were different, this difference would be reconciled.","4742":"Second, I shall prove the same thing at parts closer to aphelion.","4743":"On 1589 April 5 at 11h 33m Mars was observed at 7\u00b0 31' 10\" Scorpio with latitude 1\u00b0 28' 13\" N ^15.","4744":"It was very near the meridian, and consequently there were no horizontal variations.","4745":"The mean longitude is concluded to be 7s 9\u00b0 46' 8\".","4746":"And the","4747":"aphelion is at 4s 28\u00b0 51' 8\".","4748":"Therefore, the mean anomaly is 70\u00b0 55' 0\", to which corresponds an equated anomaly of 61\u00b0 17' 35\", by the vicarious hypothesis.","4749":"And so the eccentric position is 0\u00b0 8' 43\" Scorpio; the sun's position, 25\u00b0 52' 43\" Aries; its distance from earth 100,560; the angle at the earth 11\u00b0 38' 27\"; at the planet 7\u00b0 22' 27\".","4750":"Therefore, the distance of Mars from the sun is 158,090.","4751":"16 But again, so as not to trust the eccentric position, on account of the error of about two or three minutes which the vicarious hypothesis commits at this position on the eccentric, we shall appropriate a counterpart from 1591 Feb.","4752":"19, when, at 5\u00bdh am Mars was observed to be 28\u00b0 11' from the southern pan of Libra17 (which in that year was at 9\u00b0 23\u00bd' Scorpio), with a latitude of 0\u00b0 26' North ^18.","4753":"So Mars fell at about 7\u00b0 34\u00bd' Sagittarius, approximately ^19.","4754":"But since that eccentric position has a declination from the equator of 21\u00b0 39' 10\", [while] the observed declination of Mars was 20\u00b0 50' 30\", its latitude was therefore 48' 40\".","4755":"From this, the longitude is corrected, which becomes 7\u00b0 34\u2153\u2018 Sagittarius.","4756":"But the mean longitude is 7s 8\u00b0 21' 47\", to which corresponds an equated 59\u00b0 57' 38\", and an eccentric position of 28\u00b0 51' Libra.","4757":"Therefore, the angle at the planet is 38\u00b0 43' 20\"; the sun's position 10\u00b0 14' 25\" Pisces; therefore, the angle at the earth, 87\u00b0 20' 0\"; and the distance of the sun from the earth, 99,210.","4758":"Thus the distance of Mars from the sun comes out here to be 158,428, longer than before, because here we are also nearer to aphelion by 1\u00b0 26' 30\" ^20.","4759":"But at this place on the eccentric for one degree about 220 units are owed from the distance, or for the entire angular difference, 317, so that this place, if we carry it back to an anomaly similar to the preceding, has a distance of 158,111 rather precisely.","4760":"Whence it is proved that these two eccentric positions, treated by the method given above, will show exactly the same eccentric position as our vicarious hypothesis, except that on account of our nearness to 17\u00b0 Scorpio we run the risk of being in error by one or two minutes.","4761":"Moreover, in the latter of these, the distance from Aquila comes out to 54\u00b0 12', which is not within 12' of agreeing with the other observed data, and consequently this observation is not perfectly certain.","4762":"Also, some small quantity should be added, owing to the latitude.","4763":"A suitable observation at a similar longitude on the other semicircle occurred on 1582 November 12 at 6\u00beh am, when the sun's position was 29\u00b0 35' 17\" Scorpio ^21.","4764":"Its distance was 98,503, mean longitude of Mars 2s 15\u00b0 10' 20\", aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 44' 20\".","4765":"Hence, the full-circle complement of the mean  anomaly was 73\u00b0 34', and of the equated anomaly, 63\u00b0 45' 18\".","4766":"Hence, the eccentric position was 24\u00b0 59' 2\" Gemini.","4767":"Then, I say, the planet was observed at 26\u00b0 35' 30\" Cancer, making the angle of vision, the one at the earth, 57\u00b0 0' 13\", and at the planet, 31\u00b0 36' 28\".","4768":"By these data it is determined that the planet's distance from the sun was 157,631.","4769":"And because the anomaly was previously 70\u00b0 55', and is now 73\u00b0 34', we are therefore lower by 2\u00b0 39'.","4770":"For this, in the previously mentioned ratio, 586 units are owed.","4771":"So from the analogy of this  observation with the previous one, at a similar anomaly, a distance of 158,217 is appropriate, where again about the same amount as before, or a little more, is to be added for the latitude.","4772":"The difference is about 127, which is excused owing to the uncertainty of the prior observations.","4773":"For it is very small, and may be neglected in our present undertaking, where we are considering magnitudes of 1800 or 3600 or still more.","4774":"But let us move yet higher towards aphelion, and explore those places","4775":"what was shown in Ch.","4776":"6, the dislocation of the eccentric occasioned by exchanging the sun's mean motion for its true motion can occur most clearly, namely, at the sun's apogee and the sign of Cancer.","4777":"On 1596 March 9 at 7h 40m pm, when the sun's position was 29\u00b0 31' 24\"","4778":"Pisces, the distance from earth 99,764, Mars's mean longitude 3s 15\u00b0 35' 0\", aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 58' 31\", the full-circle complement of the mean anomaly 43\u00b0 23' 31\", equated anomaly 36\u00b0 40' 2\", eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 22\u00b0 18' 29\" Cancer\u2014the planet was observed at 15\u00b0 49' 12\" Gemini, latitude 1\u00b0 47' 40\" N ^22.","4779":"Therefore, the angle at the earth was 76\u00b0 17' 48\", at the planet 36\u00b0 29' 17\".","4780":"Therefore, the distance of Mars from the sun was 162,994, or more correctly, this was the distance of the point in the plane of the ecliptic perpendicularly beneath the body of Mars.","4781":"But, for safety's sake, let another observation be added.","4782":"And Mars was at precisely the same sidereal position on 1584 Nov.","4783":"25 at 10h 20m, when the sun was at 14\u00b0 0' 3\" Sagittarius, distance from earth 98,318.","4784":"The mean anomaly was not perceptibly different from the previous one, because the motion of the aphelion is only very slightly faster than the motion of the fixed stars.","4785":"Therefore, the eccentric position is the same, 22\u00b0 8' 44\" Cancer, if you subtract the precession of 9' 45\".","4786":"But the planet was observed on Nov.","4787":"12 at 13h 26m at 23\u00b0 14' 15\" Leo,23 with latitude 2\u00b0 12' 24\" N. On the 20th of Nov.","4788":"following, at 18h 30m astronomically,24 it appeared at 26\u00b0 0' 30\" Leo ^25.","4789":"Thus in 8 days 5 hours it was moved forward 2\u00b0 46' 25\".","4790":"In Magini, this is 2\u00b0 48'.","4791":"Therefore, since our time follows by 4 days 15h 49m, to which corresponds 1\u00b0 28' of motion from Magini,26 we shall add 1\u00b0 27' according to the above ratio.","4792":"So Mars could have been observed at 27\u00b0 27' 30\" Leo, approximately.","4793":"Therefore, the angle at the earth was 73\u00b0 27' 27\", at the planet 35\u00b0 18' 46\".","4794":"Hence, the distance of Mars from the sun here was 163,051, exceeding the previous one by 57 units.","4795":"This can be absorbed by a very slight change in the eccentric position, as, indeed, the vicarious hypothesis is not trustworthy to within one minute.","4796":"Furthermore, I could easily have made some slight error in the application of the observation.","4797":"For a similar longitude in the other semicircle, we shall again take up the observations of Chapter 27.","4798":"There I derived a distance somewhat less than 163,100 using the equation of the observations, but from the bare observations themselves I obtained 162,818, in the plane of the ecliptic as before.","4799":"Now for one of the times introduced in that chapter, 1589 Feb.","4800":"1227 at 5h 13m am, the mean longitude was 6s 12\u00b0 38' 44\",28 aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 50' 57\"; and consequently, the mean anomaly was 43\u00b0 47' 48\", lower than our previous one by 24 minutes.","4801":"To this there corresponds [an adjustment of] about 64 units at this position on the eccentric.","4802":"So the distance which was less than 163,13729 at an anomaly of  43\u00b0 48' will again be increased at anomaly 43\u00b0 24' according to this ratio, so as to make it almost exactly 163,100 in this semicircle.","4803":"In the previous one it was 163,051 and 162,996.","4804":"Again, not an outstanding fit.","4805":"It should be noted, however, that in Chapter 27, to which I am referring here, the observations led us to subtract 1' 30\" from the eccentric position computed from our vicarious hypothesis at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Libra, and this was through the observations of 1585, 1587, 1589, and 1590.","4806":"Second, in Chapter 18 above, the acronychal observation of 1589, at 5\u00b0 Scorpio, gave the same testimony, namely, that our vicarious hypothesis needs to be diminished by 2\u2155\u2019.","4807":"And in 1591, at 26\u00b0 Sagittarius, there still was one minute to be subtracted.","4808":"Third, in this very chapter, about 16\u00b0 Scorpio, the observations of 1589 and 1594 required 3\u00bd minutes to be subtracted from the eccentric position computed from our vicarious hypothesis.","4809":"So therefore this is constant about the middle elongation of this semicircle.","4810":"And likewise, near aphelion, we shall again take up the observations of  Chapter 28, where at a mean anomaly of 11\u00b0 37' a distance of 166,180 or 166,208 was found (without correction for latitude).","4811":"This was in the descending semicircle.","4812":"But it was at a similar anomaly on the ascending semicircle at  the following times.","4813":"On 1585 January 24 at 9h, when the position of the sun was 15\u00b0 9' 5\" Aquarius, its distance from earth 98,590, the mean longitude of Mars 4s 16\u00b0 50' 10\", the aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 46' 41\", the remainder of the mean anomaly to complete the full circle 11\u00b0 56' 31\", and the consequent eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 18\u00b0 49' 0\" Leo: the planet was observed at 24\u00b0 9' 30\" Leo, latitude 4\u00b0 31' 0\" N ^30.","4814":"The angle at earth was therefore 9\u00b0 0' 25\", and at the planet 5\u00b0 20' 30\".","4815":"Therefore, the distance of Mars from the sun was 165,792.","4816":"But if you subtract 1' 30\" from the vicarious hypothesis here, as appeared necessary above in Ch.","4817":"18 in the computation of the acronychal opposition, the angle at the planet will be 5\u00b0 19', and the distance of Mars from the sun 166,580.","4818":"And the distance here is easily changed to this extent, because earth and Mars are close to one another.","4819":"Therefore, for insurance, we shall bring in other positions.","4820":"On 1586 December 16 at 6\u00bdh am, when the sun was at 4\u00b0 16' 51\" Capricorn, 98,200 distant from earth, mean longitude of Mars 4s 18' 39' 9\", remainder of mean anomaly 10\u00b0 9' 41\", eccentric position from the vicarious hypothesis 20\u00b0 20' 30\" Leo: the declination of Mars was found to be 3\u00b0 54', right ascension from Arcturus and Spica 177\u00b0 27' ^31.","4821":"Thus its longitude was 26\u00b0 6' 24\" Virgo, latitude 2\u00b0 35'.","4822":"Hence, the angle at earth was 81\u00b0 49' 33\", at the planet 35\u00b0 45' 54\".","4823":"And the distance was 166,311, but by subtraction of 1' 30\" from the eccentric position, 166,208.","4824":"And at the previous distance from aphelion, 11\u00b0 37', it would be about 70 units less.","4825":"So it would be either 166,241 or 166,138.","4826":"On 1588

60\u00b0 47' 43\", at the planet 31\u00b0 8' 12\".","4830":"And thus the planet's distance from the sun was 166,511.","4831":"But by subtraction of 1' 30\" from the position of the vicarious hypothesis, the distance becomes 166,396.","4832":"And by this analogy, at the greater distance from aphelion of 11\u00b0 37', where it is less by about 110, it is either 166,401 or 166,286.","4833":"There is a discrepancy of 150 between this and the previous one.","4834":"And if, keeping the correction of the eccentric position, we take a mean between the two, 166,230, as if saying that in the two observations of 1586 and 1588 there were some small observational errors in opposite senses [in the determination of the distance], we will hardly differ at all from the distance in the descending semicircle.","4835":"Even this small difference will be able to be abolished by a slight retraction of the aphelion, of which more later.","4836":"Thus, near aphelion also, as far as the senses can judge, we find the same distances from the sun at the same relationship to the aphelion in the two semicircles.","4837":"All three observations were made when Mars was in the east, and none with Mars in the west.","4838":"For the rest of the observations [sc.","4839":"of Mars at these mean longitudes] are lacking.","4840":"Therefore, we will probably be safer to stay with the distance in the descending semicircle.","4841":"Third, let the same things we have explored above the middle elongations now be explored below, near perihelion.","4842":"In 1591 on the night following May 13, at 1 hour 40m past midnight, when the sun was at 2\u00b0 8' 43\" Gemini, distant from earth 101,487, while the mean longitude of Mars was 8s 22\u00b0 18' 4\", anomaly 113\u00b0 24'

an error of one minute in eccentric position causes the loss of 120 of our units at this distance of Mars from earth, and at this distance of the sun in the opposite position.","4847":"So these slight discrepancies need no further attention.","4848":"Besides, this observation is well supported by others on many of the days nearby, right up to the day of opposition with the sun.","4849":"But since

positions.","4887":"Therefore, ADK, AGK, AFK, AEK are given.","4888":"So, through the opposition of the sides to the angles, DKA, GKA, FKA, EKA are also given.","4889":"Hence, so is the position of KA, four times.","4890":"So, since the first and third position here agree rather closely, some less thoughtful person will think that it should be established using these, the others being somehow reconciled.","4891":"And I myself tried to do this for rather a long time.","4892":"But since the second and fourth could not be reconciled, while the force of these observations was great, because in each the planet was observed in quadrature with the sun, and in the quadrilateral AEKG all the sides and angles are about equal, I therefore settled it as follows.","4893":"From the vicarious hypothesis, you see that AK in the second observation ought to be distant from AK in the fourth by 17' 22\".","4894":"But by the assumption of this length, the two positions of AK are 30' 55\" apart.","4895":"So this is too much by 13' 33\".","4896":"And since all angles of the quadrilateral are about equal, I divided the excess in two, and added 6' 46\" to the angles EKA, GKA.","4897":"For in the observation at E, the line AK had moved forward too much, and not enough at G. So, with the two AKs moved back towards E and G, EK and GK staying fixed (for we are supposing the observations to be most certain), the angles at K will in all cases be increased.","4898":"So now, given the angles GKA, 45\u00b0 35' 13\", and EKA, 46\u00b0 51' 16\", the other angles G, E, and the lines EA, GA remaining the same, AK comes out to be 138,765, and 138,787, differing from our assumed value by 258 units.","4899":"So if we also subtract that much from the other two AKs, so as to make them 138,954 and 139,000, the resulting angles are DKA 34\u00b0 43' 47\" and AK 20\u00b0 9' 40\" [Pisces]; while FKA is 12\u00b0 1' 24\" and AK 20\u00b0 55' 15\" [Pisces].","4900":"But since I previously added 6' 46\" at G and subtracted the same amount at E, I have therefore repositioned the eccentric positions at 17\u00b0 2' 31\" Pisces at G, and 17\u00b0 19' 54\" Pisces at E, increasing the position given by the vicarious hypothesis by 3' 17\".","4901":"Therefore, the same amount also ought to result at D,","4902":"And so I have also brought the other two positions near enough together.","4903":"For their errors lie both past and short of the truth, which lends security.","4904":"And to attribute an error of two minutes to observations at these positions, owing to the low elevation of the zodiac and horizontal variations, is not excessive.","4905":"At a similar anomaly on the descending semicircle, the observations at  hand are no more than one, but it is certain enough.","4906":"For on the night following June 29 in 1593, at 1h 30m after midnight, when the sun was at 17\u00b0 25' 42\" Cancer, 101,760 distant from earth, the longitude of Mars 10s 10\u00b0 1' 29\", anomaly 161\u00b0 5' 29\", and the consequent position of Mars 6\u00b0 10' 5\" Aquarius, it was observed at 13\u00b0 37' 22\" Pisces, with latitude 4\u00b0 37' S ^38.","4907":"Hence, the supplement of the angle at earth was 56\u00b0 11' 46\", at the planet, or the parallax of the annual orb, 37\u00b0 27' 23\".","4908":"From which the distance of Mars from the sun comes out to be 139,036.","4909":"But above, at an anomaly of 161\u00b0 45' 28\", where Mars was 40 minutes farther from aphelion than here, the distance was found and established as 139,000.","4910":"And at this position on the eccentric these 40 minutes effect a change of 52 units.","4911":"So here too, by extrapolation from our anomaly, there results a distance of 138,984 at an anomaly of 161\u00b0 45\u00bd', an admirable consensus much to be suspected.","4912":"For they can hardly all be so certain and neat.","4913":"Furthermore, both distances must be increased somewhat owing to the inclination of this position on the eccentric, which is at a maximum.","4914":"So, from this long induction, using a great many positions on the eccentric, it is clear that those distances of Mars from the sun are mutually equal whose points on the orbit are equally remote from aphelion, a question which we have investigated in Ch.","4915":"16 and 42.","4916":"This is an evident way of showing that the aphelion we have obtained is correct, by Euclid III.","4917":"7.","4918":"At the same time, the distances of the sun from earth are confirmed, which were derived in Ch.","4919":"29 above and employed here in various ways.","4920":"Nor is there any great discrepancy in the numbers that could testify to any flaw in them.","4921":"The implications of the observations presented in this chapter, and of the distances found through them, for the shaping of the planetary path, for which purpose we have produced them in this chapter, we shall postpone until Chapter 55.","4922":"First, there is something that must be proved in Ch.","4923":"52 following, and in Ch.","4924":"53 many more observations are going to be called upon to testify.","4925":"Chapter 52","4926":"Demonstration from the observations of Chapter 51 that the planet\u2019s eccentric is set up, not about the center of the sun\u2019s epicycle, or the point of the sun\u2019s mean position, but about the actual body of the sun; and that the line of apsides goes through the latter rather than the former.","4927":"It is a happy accident that the distances found in Chapter 51 also inform us about this, which, though promised in Chapters 6, 26, and 33,","4928":"I deliberately postponed until this point.","4929":"For if I was correct in constructing the eccentric of Mars about the body of the sun, it is necessary that the planet really be at its greatest distance from the sun in the parts around 29\u00b0","4930":"Leo, and that those parts which are at","4931":"equal intervals from 29\u00b0 Leo in either semicircle be at equal distances from the sun, and at unequal distances from the point that stands for the sun, which for Brahe is the center of the sun's epicycle.","4932":"More specifically, the distances should be less in the descending semicircle.","4933":"When this is proved, it will follow in addition that the parts around 24\u00b0 Leo are neither the most distant from the sun's body, nor from the Copernican center of the world, which for Brahe is the center of the sun's epicycle, and also the center to which the planetary circle is attached; and the parts at an equal arc's removal from 24\u00b0 Leo in either semicircle are at unequal distances from the sun and from the point that stands for it.","4934":"For let there be set out the sun's center A, Mars's line of apsides AC, eccentricity AC, and the eccentric ED with center C, and let the point F above AC be the point of uniform motion, G the aphelion, GFE and GFD equal angles, and let EA, DA be connected, which will be equal, as has now been proven.","4935":"And through A let the line AB be drawn towards Capricorn, and let AB be extended from A towards Capricorn until its length be 1800 of the units of which AC was 14,140 in Chapter 42, and AE, AD, 154,400; and let B be the center of the earth's orb.","4936":"Now because BA is directed towards 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, and AE towards 15\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio, the angle EAB is about 50\u00b0 and acute, and EBA obtuse.","4937":"Hence, EA is longer than EB.","4938":"Likewise, since BA is directed towards 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, while AD is directed towards 12\u00bd\u00b0 Gemini, BAD is therefore 157\u00b0 and ABD is quite acute.","4939":"Hence, AD, or AE which is equal to it, is shorter than BD.","4940":"Therefore BE is much shorter than BD, and the difference is quite perceptible.","4941":"For who are we to neglect AB, which is 1800 or even more, who could not tolerate observations with a mere 200 units' error?","4942":"Hence, regions on opposite semicircles of the eccentric that are equidistant from G, such as E and D, are not equidistant from any points not at the center other than those on the line CA that goes through the body of the sun ^1.","4943":"You may reply, however, that if BC is connected and extended, a new apsis is created where that line intersects the circle, and the point D is closer to that apsis than is the point E. So is it any wonder that BD is also longer?","4944":"I answer that whatever lines are drawn, AE and AD always stay the same, since they are proven from the observations, in all three forms of hypotheses, and thus absolutely nothing in this derivation was assumed that could be subject to controversy.","4945":"And so, with AE and AD remaining the same, let BC be drawn exactly as is objected against me.","4946":"Nevertheless, that line BC by no means gives rise to a hypothesis that will fit the acronychal2 observations, as I proved in Chapter 6.","4947":"Instead, to save the acronychal positions, one needs to substitute for BC a line FH through F parallel to CB, passing through F and H, the centers of uniform motion for Mars and the sun.","4948":"But when this is done, the center of the eccentric is at the same time transferred from C to I, and there is more than a semicircle on the side of E, and less on the side of D. Nor are AE and AD left unchanged, but AE is lengthened, and AD is shortened.","4949":"And since these lines are altered, the observations at positions other than acronychal will never be saved, since they give evidence that AE and AD are equal.","4950":"I don't think there is any need for computation.","4951":"Nevertheless, if there is anyone who enjoys this labor (even though no astronomer should try anything with numbers whose foundations he has not previously seen in geometry, and geometry has just overturned the foundations of such an undertaking), he has an example of it in Ch.","4952":"24 above.","4953":"There, I computed the distances of earth from H, the point of uniformity of the earth's motion, and the distance of Mars from the same point H, simultaneously in a single operation, using the same observations by which I afterwards computed the distances of earth and Mars from the center of the sun A, in Ch.","4954":"26.","4955":"For the peculiar cleverness of the method I have used is this: that it shows that whatever point in the plane of the earth's circle is chosen that has, with respect to the sun's body, a position described and determined through a number of observations both in zodiacal longitude and in distance from the sun, also shows the distance of earth and Mars from that chosen point; and it does these things without any knowledge of the equated anomaly on the eccentric corresponding to that point.","4956":"In fact, the only reason why I used that knowledge in Chapter 26 was that it is a short cut ^3.","4957":"But in addition, there is another way to argue the point.","4958":"It was proved in Chapter 44 above that the planet's orbit is not a circle but an oval, such that the diameter on it which is called the [line] of apsides is the longest.","4959":"Just now, in Ch.","4960":"51, it was proved that regions that are equally removed from the point of the aphelion G also make an equal incursion at the sides.","4961":"There is thus a real oval situated about the line AC, and therefore, it is not situated about the line FH.","4962":"And one who would compute the various distances of Mars from the point H by the method just recommended will find a great irregularity in the distances, incapable of being included by any means in a circle or in any other possible figure set up about FH.","4963":"So again the faith that was pledged in Chapter 6 and in many other places in this work, I have redeemed from all tincture of circular reasoning, and have shown that the eccentric of Mars cannot be referred to anything but the sun itself; and that, in consequence, it is not only reason that stands with me, but the observations themselves, in my releasing the observations of Mars from the sun's mean motion and measuring them out by the apparent motion of the sun.","4964":"Chapter 53","4965":"Another method of exploring the distances of Mars from the sun, using severed contiguous observations before and after acronychal position: wherein the eccentric positions are also explored at the same time.","4966":"Since we are establishing new hypotheses here, in that we are enquiring into the natural cause of the eccentric equations, it is appropriate that we should explore everything as carefully as possible, lest in neglecting the foundations we build upon them a building doomed to ruin.","4967":"And so it furthers us to  explore this same thing (perfectly accurate distances of Mars from the sun) by many methods.","4968":"Let \u03b1 be the sun, \u03b2 the position of earth before opposition of Mars to the sun, and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 the angle of vision, or the arc of the elongation of \u03b4 from the sun.","4969":"Likewise, let \u03b3 be the position of the earth after opposition, and \u03b1\u03b3\u03b4 the angle of vision.","4970":"Thus, at the first time, let the planet be on the line \u03b2\u03b4, and at the second, on the line \u03b3\u03b4, and let it actually traverse \u03b8\u03b7.","4971":"So, when the time of the two observations is given, the angle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b7 will be given precisely enough by the vicarious hypothesis, for whatever eccentric position.","4972":"If the pair of times are not far from each other, or if the planet is near the apsides or the middle elongations, the difference in length of the lines \u03b1\u03b8, \u03b1\u03b7 will also be known tolerably ^1.","4973":"And we have included this much among our presuppositions only in order that there be no remaining difficulty here.","4974":"And so, in dealing with the angles \u03b8\u03b2\u03b1, \u03b7\u03b3\u03b1, given by observation, and \u03b2\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b1, which are known from Part III, if we were to assume [a value for] \u03b8\u03b1, and consequently also \u03b7\u03b1, it is obvious that if this assumed value were longer than it should be, such as \u03ba\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, then the angle \u03b9\u03b1\u03ba would come out less than it should be; and if, on the other hand, it were shorter than it should be, such as \u03b6\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, the angle \u03b5\u03b1\u03b6 would come out greater than it should be.","4975":"So we must assume such distances as will make the angle of motion on the eccentric come out right.","4976":"Any possible remaining error in the eccentric position will also occur in the same way.","4977":"For let it be that \u03b8\u03b1, \u03b7\u03b1 are in their correct positions, and from that point let \u03b8\u03b1 be carried forward, in error, through the angle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b4.","4978":"And let \u03b7\u03b1 likewise be carried forward, through the equal angle \u03b7\u03b1\u03b5.","4979":"You see that \u03b1\u03b4, substituted for \u03b1\u03b8, is going to be very much too long, and \u03b1\u03b5, following \u03b1\u03b7, will be quite short, contrary to what, by hypothesis, is known at the start.","4980":"Furthermore, the angle \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 ought not to be as small as possible, so that no error of observation, or at least no minimal one, in opposite directions in the sky (as can happen) could have any great effect.","4981":"Now, with the help of this method, we must go through the years 1582 in Cancer, 1585 in Leo, 1587 in Virgo, 1589 in Scorpio, 1591 in Sagittarius, 1593 in Pisces, and 1595 in Taurus.","4982":"For sufficient observations are at hand in all places.","4983":"If it seems a good idea to investigate demonstratively the elongation of the earth from the line through the sun and the planet at which any error in the distance of Mars from the sun would be most evidently perceived, let Ch.","4984":"6 be consulted.","4985":"For, following that chapter, we shall define it as that angle at the sun whose sine has to the radius about the same ratio as the excess of Mars's distance from the sun over the sine of the complement of the angle has to the distance itself.","4986":"For let \u03b1 be the sun, \u03b8 the planet, \u03bd\u03be the earth's orb.","4987":"From \u03b8 let the straight line \u03b8\u03bc be drawn perpendicular to \u03b8\u03b1.","4988":"And on \u03b8\u03bc let a number of centers be chosen, about which let circles through \u03b8 be described, until one of them be tangent to the earth's orb at \u03bd ^2.","4989":"The point \u03bd will be where the defect of \u03b1\u03b8 at \u03b8 appears most evidently, that is, where it subtends the greatest angle.","4990":"3 From \u03bd let \u03bd\u03bf be drawn parallel to \u03bc\u03b8, intersecting \u03b1\u03b8 at \u03bf. I say that \u03bf\u03bd is to \u03bd\u03b1 as \u03bf\u03b8 is to \u03b8\u03b1.","4991":"For as \u03bd\u03bc, or (which is the same thing) \u03b8\u03bc, is to \u03bc\u03b1, so is \u03bf\u03bd to \u03bd\u03b1.","4992":"But \u03bd\u03bc is to \u03bc\u03b1 as \u03bf\u03b8, and (very nearly) \u03be\u03b8, is to \u03b8\u03b1 ^4.","4993":"Therefore, etc.","4994":"Let \u03b1\u03b8 be 161,000.","4995":"Thus \u03be\u03b8 will be nearly 61,000.","4996":"And as 161 is to 61, so is 100,000 to 37,888.","4997":"This, taken as a sine, shows the angle \u03bd\u03b1\u03b8 to be 22\u00b0 15\u2019, and greater, if instead of \u03be\u03b8 you take \u03bf\u03b8.","4998":"So, many days, nearly 45, pass before the anomaly of relative motion is  altered by 22\u00bc degrees.","4999":"And before or after this time, \u03b1\u03b8 is much different.","5000":"So at aphelion this angle of relative motion is about 28\u00b0, and at perihelion about 18\u2153\u00b0.","5001":"And now, having found the termini at which any error that may arise will be most evident, owing to an incorrect distance of Mars from the sun, it is easy for us to choose suitable observations, since many are available.","5002":"We shall begin from the opposition of 1582, from which year we shall choose the following observations.","5003":"5","5004":"6","5005":"7","5006":"8","5007":"The two intermediate ones differ by 4240.","5008":"And indeed, the later one \u03b1\u03b7, is shorter, although it should have been longer by 336 ^9.","5009":"So the sum of the two is 322,054.","5010":"From this I subtract 336, and again add it.","5011":"The halves of these are 160,859, which is \u03b1\u03b8, and 161,363,10 which is \u03b1\u03b7.","5012":"And \u03b1\u03b8 will be at 16\u00b0 5' Cancer, and \u03b1\u03b7 at 17\u00b0 55' Cancer ^11.","5013":"So here, the vicarious hypothesis would lose 1\u00bd minutes.","5014":"But the distances themselves are not to be trusted, owing to the angle's being too small.","5015":"For if the angle at \u03b4 be varied by one minute, through an error in observing, as easily happens, we shall be in error by a thousand units in either distance.","5016":"Therefore, let the two more remote ones be taken, which are found to differ by 5236.","5017":"But we already know that they should differ by about 5570.","5018":"So by an operation conducted as before, the more nearly correct values resulting are: \u03b1\u03b8 158,792, and \u03b1\u03b7 164,364, placing \u03b1\u03b8 at 0\u00b0 41' 0\" Cancer, and \u03b1\u03b7 at 0\u00b0 8' 30\" Leo.","5019":"And it becomes certain, through observations on the four days at this position, that about 1\u00bd minutes must be subtracted from the eccentric positions derived from our vicarious hypothesis.","5020":"The distances found before are approximately confirmed as well, both before and beyond opposition, which turn out to have a magnitude between these.","5021":"Unless, as the comparison indicates, they ought to be somewhat longer ^12.","5022":"But at the same time it is clear that if the angle \u03b8\u03b4\u03b7 had been off by one minute, both distances would have been off by about 50 units, no more.","5023":"So in these distances there can barely be an error of the hundredth part of the uncertainty that there was in the previous ones.","5024":"Now, if a longitude that was taken up expresses satisfactorily the observed values for the distances for these four days, it will also express the observed values for the intervening days, namely, November 25, 26, and 27, and December 3, 17, 27, 28, and 29 of 1582, and January 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, and 22 of 1583.","5025":"Let us proceed to the opposition of 1585.","5026":"For while the sun and Mars were  at opposition on January 31 of that year, the planet was observed at many closely-spaced positions over the two months preceding and the same number following.","5027":"From among them we shall take these four observations ^13.","5028":"The two intermediate ones differ by 118.","5029":"They should have differed by 187 in the opposite sense, so that \u03b1\u03b8 would be 166,226 and \u03b1\u03b7 166,412.","5030":"Therefore, \u03b1\u03b8 falls at 18\u00b0 48' 47\" Leo, and \u03b1\u03b7 at 23\u00b0 34' 48\" Leo.","5031":"And the contemptibly small alteration of the eccentric position confirms the vicarious hypothesis for this place.","5032":"But we learn from this that an error of one minute in observation at this place would vitiate the two distances by about 100 units.","5033":"When the more remote ones are consulted, their difference is found to be 1022.","5034":"From what is known already approximately from the hypothesis, the difference should have been greater, namely, 1275.","5035":"And, in fact, the fourth [degree] of Leo is close to the eighteenth of Cancer, where previously something had to be subtracted from the eccentric position of the vicarious hypothesis.","5036":"So, if you will subtract one minute at the fourth of Leo, you will now make \u03b1\u03b8 a hundred units shorter, and if 2\u00bd\u2019, you will make it about 164,934, which is short enough that \u03b1\u03b7 can also keep the length 166,206; and the last observation in the previous year 1583, which showed a length of 164,364, can be reconciled with it.","5037":"For they should have differed by 488, a certain enough value provided in advance by the hypothesis of the distances, while they do differ by 570.","5038":"Furthermore, it is possible to transfer half of this 2\u00bd\u2019 change in the eccentric position to the observations.","5039":"For if either of them has erred by one minute, that will be able to effect an error of 50 units in either distance.","5040":"It would be tedious to repeat the same method, using the same words, for all the years of the oppositions.","5041":"And so, in the following table, I have placed the observations themselves which I have consulted, and added what resulted from the computations.","5042":"The hypotheses underlying the calculations are these.","5043":"The sun's position is taken from Brahe.","5044":"The sun-earth distance is from Ch.","5045":"30.","5046":"The aphelion of Mars for the end of 160014 is 29\u00b0 0\u2154\u2019 Leo ^15.","5047":"The mean motion at the same time is 10s 7\u00b0 14\u2019 34\" ^16.","5048":"The eccentricity and ratio of the orbs is as in Ch.","5049":"54 ^17.","5050":"To this I have added the distances of Mars from the sun as if previously known ^18.","5051":"So if, using these distances, we match the proposed observations, these distances will be the correct ones, which is what  I proposed to show in this chapter.","5052":"These, then, are the distances that will result from an investigation using the method of this chapter from the observations set out here The apparent positions, on the other hand, when Mars's eccentric position is in Cancer, will come out about 4 minutes back from these, and in Sagittarius and Capricorn the same number of minutes forward.","5053":"These small errors do not come from incorrect distances, for they would then be in opposite senses on opposite sides [of opposition], and not in the same sense ^19.","5054":"I believe they can be reconciled by changing the sun's apogee by one degree, which is easily permitted by Brahe's observations.","5055":"Nevertheless, I am not going to say anything definite at present.","5056":"For the correction of both this apogee and the entire hypothesis is reserved for the book of Tables ^20.","5057":"Chapter 54","5058":"A more accurate examination of the ratio of the orbs.","5059":"In Chapter 42, we did actually establish the ratio of the orbs from observations at positions other than acronychal, but they were not ones that were in agreement with one another entirely and to our full satisfaction ^1.","5060":"Moreover, considered in itself, regardless of whether the most exact observations be available, the procedure is incapable of being brought to a certitude of 100 units.","5061":"So it has to be done by polling and counting the votes.","5062":"And in Chapter 28, at a mean anomaly of 11\u00b0 37', which, after the correction of Chapter 53 preceding, becomes 11\u00b0 52',2 the distance of the point on the ecliptic to which a perpendicular dropped from the body of Mars descends, was found to be 166,180, or 166,208.","5063":"And therefore, since this position is 23\u00b0 from the northern limit, the inclination will be about 1\u00b0 43', and excess of the secant will be 45 units, which will be about 70 in our dimensions.","5064":"Therefore, the distance of Mars from the sun will be 166,250 or 166,278.","5065":"We shall now also compare the observations of Chapter 51, so as to be supported by an middling consensus.","5066":"In 1586, with 10\u00b0 9' 41\" of mean anomaly remaining, or 9\u00b0 54' 41\" after correction, we found 166,311.","5067":"But by subtracting 1\u00bd\u2019 from the position given by the vicarious hypothesis, we found 166,208.","5068":"So for a subtraction of 3 minutes less than two degrees,3 about 95 should be subtracted, making it 166,113.","5069":"For the latitude, 80 must again be added, making it 166,193.","5070":"Thus in 1588, when the remaining [mean] anomaly was 8\u00b0 2' 51\", or 7\u00b0 47' 51\" corrected, by a subtraction of 1\u00bd\u2019 from the position given by the vicarious hypothesis we found the distance to be 166,396.","5071":"Thus, a position 4\u00b0 4' lower will be shorter by about 102, making it 166,294.","5072":"And, corrected for latitude, 166,284.","5073":"This was previously found to be 166,193, from 1586.","5074":"The mean is 166,238.","5075":"In the descending semicircle, however, from 5 observations, we had found 166,250 or 166,278.","5076":"So, although the difference is imperceptible, let us nevertheless take the mean, 166,260, giving more trust to the descending semicircle, as it is better confirmed by the observations.","5077":"Let it thus be [taken as] certain that at a mean anomaly of 11\u00b0 52' the distance is 166,260.","5078":"Hence, however great a hypothetical value you may conceive by some rough method, which is to be confirmed shortly thereafter, it follows that where the radius is 100,000, the distances at aphelion cannot increase more than 164 units, and even less if you use the hypothesis of a perfect circle.","5079":"But those units converted through a preconceived ratio of the orbs, as it is set up in Ch.","5080":"42, add about 250, and these added to 166,260 make 166,510.","5081":"But above, in Ch.","5082":"42, we found 166,780, using weaker observations.","5083":"The difference is 270 units.","5084":"We shall also treat likewise the perihelial distance which in Ch.","5085":"42 was found to be 138,500, from observations that were not solid enough.","5086":"Just now, in Ch.","5087":"51, at a remaining [mean] anomaly of 161\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019, or 161\u00b0 30\u00bd' after correction, we found the distance, before correction for latitude, to be 139,000 or 138,984.","5088":"So let 139,000 be at 21 Pisces.","5089":"Since this position is 35 degrees from the limit, the inclination is therefore 1\u00b0 31\u00bd\u2019 The excess of the secant will be 35\u00bd, which is equivalent to 49 of our units.","5090":"And so the true distance of Mars from the sun is 139,049.","5091":"But if the radius is 100,000, the perihelial distance is 5754 units shorter than that at an anomaly of 161\u00bd\u00b0, which becomes 876 of our units, or less, if you use a perfect circle.","5092":"And when these are subtracted from 139,049, there remains the perihelial distance of 138,173.","5093":"The difference from the value 138,500, found in Chapter 42, is 327.","5094":"So, according to this method, these distances are found:","5095":"And where 152,342 becomes 100,000, 14,169 becomes 9301.","5096":"Nevertheless, because our observations, especially at perigee, do not bear out that great a difference, and since it can happen that the vicarious hypothesis, since it is false, also might introduce some falsity into the eccentricity, let all the votes be tallied before the result is announced.","5097":"And so we shall adapt the aphelial distance found here, 166,510, to the eccentricity of Ch.","5098":"42, which was 9265.","5099":"And as 109,265 is to 90,735, so is 166,510 to 138,274, where the radius is almost exactly 152,400.","5100":"Also, manifold experience has shown that the eccentricity that is most true and best fitted to the physical equations is between 9230 and 9300; that is, the eccentricity of Chapter 42, which is 9265.","5101":"Therefore, that we might not unduly abandon the perihelial distance found in this chapter, which is 138,173, nor unduly trust the aphelial distance of 166,510, let us conclude that the truest aphelial is 166,465, and the perihelial, 138,234, where the radius is 152,350.","5102":"Chapter 55","5103":"From the observations of Chapters 51 and 53, and the ratio of the orbs of Chapter 54, it is demonstrated that the hypothesis seized upon in Chapter 45 is in error, and makes the distances at the middle elongations shorter than they should be.","5104":"Indeed, I began to say this in Chapter 51.","5105":"But since more observations, and more suitable ones, had to be provided to give evidence in Chapter 53, from which at the same time something else was also inferred in Chapter 52, the full demonstration was therefore postponed to this point.","5106":"There is no need for verbosity.","5107":"At the mean anomalies of all the examples  appearing in Ch.","5108":"51 and 52 let the distances be computed according to the hypothesis of Chapter 45 and the ratio of orbs of Ch.","5109":"54, by the method I used from Chapter 46 through Chapter 50, and let them be compared to the distances of Ch.","5110":"51 and 53, found using infallible observations.","5111":"It will be apparent that the more we descend from the apsides, the more the computed distances fall short of the observed distances, a result quite the opposite of what we saw in Ch.","5112":"44 above.","5113":"For there, the distances computed according to the law of the circle were longer than the observed distances at the middle elongations, while here, the distances resulting from the hypothesis that makes the planet's orbit oval are shorter.","5114":"It is therefore obvious that the planet's path is neither a circle nor such as to make as great an incursion from the circle at the sides as does the oval that arose from the opinion of Chapter 45 and was described in Chapter 46; but takes a middle course.","5115":"And if, in turn, using the distances of Chapter 45, you compute the observed positions of Mars, especially those which, in Ch.","5116":"53, stood at some distance on either side of opposition, the planet before opposition will fall too far forward, and after opposition, too far back.","5117":"This is most evident in the descending semicircle in 1589 and 1591, and in the ascending semicircle in 1582 and 1595.","5118":"For in those places, the oval of Chapter 45 is 660 units1 too small, while the perfect circle is too large by the same amount, and this can have an effect upon the appearances of 20 minutes and more.","5119":"Thus, David Fabricius2 was able to use his observations to charge my hypothesis of Chapter 45, which I had communicated to him as true, with this error of having distances that are too short at the middle elongations, writing at the very time when I was laboring to seek out the true hypothesis with renewed care.","5120":"He was, in fact, quite close to arriving at the truth before me ^3.","5121":"And since the perfect circle errs the same amount in the opposite direction, we argue rightly from this that the truth is in the middle, between the two.","5122":"Moreover, the equations computed from physical causes in Chapters 49 and 50 gave the same testimony, namely, that the lunule cut off from the perfect semicircle ought to have only half the breadth of the one which the opinion of Chapter 45 cuts off.","5123":"Therefore, nothing prevents our saying that the matter is most certainly demonstrated: that the opinion of Chapter 45, in remedying the excess of the perfect circle, falls into the opposite defect.","5124":"So the physical causes of Ch.","5125":"45 go up in smoke.","5126":"Chapter 56","5127":"Demonstration from the observations already introduced, that the distances of Mars from the sun are to be chosen as if from the diameter of the epicycle.","5128":"The breadth of the lunule of Chapter 46 above, which the opinion of  Chapter 45, which instructed us to cut it off from the semicircle, has produced for us\u2014this breadth, I say, was found to be 858 units,1 of which the semidiameter of the circle is 100,000.","5129":"But then, by two arguments, which I have already presented in Chapters 49, 50, and 55, I concluded plainly that the breadth of the lunule is to be taken as only half that, namely, 429, or more correctly, 432, and in units of which the semidiameter of Mars is 152,350, nearly 660.","5130":"I therefore began to think of the causes and the manner by which a lunule of such a breadth might be cut off.","5131":"While anxiously turning this thought over in my mind, reflecting that absolutely nothing was articulated by Chapter 45, and consequently my triumph over Mars was futile, quite by chance I hit upon the secant of the angle 5\u00b0 18', which is the measure of the greatest optical equation.","5132":"And when I saw that this was 100,429, it was as if I were awakened from sleep to see a new light, and I began to reason thus.","5133":"At the middle elongations the optical part of the equation becomes a maximum.","5134":"At the middle elongations the lunule or shortening of the distances is greatest, and has the same magnitude as the excess of the secant of the greatest optical equation 100,429 over the radius 100,000.","5135":"Therefore, if the radius is substituted for the secant at the middle elongation, this accomplishes what the observations suggest.","5136":"And, in the diagram in Chapter 40,1 have concluded generally that if you use HR instead of HA, VR instead of VA, and substitute EB for EA, and so on for all of them, the effect on the rest of the eccentric positions will be the same as what was done here at the middle elongations.","5137":"And by equivalence, in the small diagram of Chapter 39, \u03b1\u03ba will be taken instead of the lines \u03b1\u03b4 or \u03b1\u03b9, and \u03b1\u03bc for \u03b1\u03b5 or \u03b1\u03bb.","5138":"And so the reader should peruse Chapter 39 again.","5139":"He will find that what the observations additionally testify here was already urged there, from natural causes, namely, that it appears reasonable that the planet perform some sort of reciprocation, moving on the diameter, as if of an epicycle, that is always directed towards the sun.","5140":"He will also find that there is nothing more at odds with this notion than this: that when we proposed to represent a perfect circle, we were forced to make the highest parts \u03b3\u03b9 of the reciprocation unequal to the lowest \u03bb\u03b6, which parts correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the highest being short, and the lowest long.","5141":"So, now that the planet's circular path is denied, and \u03ba\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b1 are taken instead of \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, that is, instead of \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, as was said, it follows further that those parts of the reciprocation, such as \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6, are equal.","5142":"And that which had tormented us for a long time in Chapter 39 now surrenders to us in the face of the proof of the truth we have perceived.","5143":"As for the middle parts \u03ba\u03bc still being larger than the extremes \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6, it will","5144":"be said in Chapter 57 following that this is in accord with nature, contrary to what we had been able to understand in Chapter 39.","5145":"But in addition, the difficulty that arose in Chapter 39 through supposing that the increase of the sun's [apparent] diameter serve the planet as an index for its approaching and receding, now vanishes entirely, as will appear in Chapter 57.","5146":"Thus, concerning the eccentric anomaly of 90\u00b0, I easily was able to see in the manner just mentioned, that instead of the distance EA of the perfect circle, EB is to be taken, corresponding to an equated anomaly EAB.","5147":"And although I have drawn a general conclusion concerning all the anomalies using a single one as an example, this was not a consequence just of that one anomaly: there was need to strengthen it using closely spaced observations.","5148":"So now you understand the special capacity in which the observations of Chapters 51 and 53 are appointed to serve us, namely, to give this evidence.","5149":"Come, then: let the eccentric anomalies CBG, CBH be computed at the equated anomalies set out in those chapters, that is, at the angles CAG, CAH, and so on.","5150":"Nor is there any need to strive after minute parts, nor be concerned about the imperfection of the eccentric equations that still remain in Ch.","5151":"19, 29, 43, 47, 48, 49, and 50.","5152":"Use any of these methods, particularly the one in Ch.","5153":"43.","5154":"You will not err in the equations by more than eight minutes.","5155":"When the angles are set up, seek out the lines, HR corresponding to the equated angle HAC, RV corresponding to the equated VAC, and so on for the others, and transpose them to the dimension of the orbs found in Ch.","5156":"54.","5157":"You will find them as in the following table.","5158":"From the observations of Ch.","5159":"51","5160":"On the descending","5161":"semicircle","5162":"Computed from the reciproca","5163":"tion","5164":"162,994","5165":"163,051","5166":"158,091","5167":"158,111","5168":"148,000","5169":"148,050","5170":"In the observations of Chapter 53, there is no need to do the same thing.","5171":"For I previously used this same method of reciprocation to find out the distances of Mars from the sun which I called upon in order to compute Mars's apparent positions.","5172":"And since the observations were represented by these, they will therefore be correct ^2.","5173":"As you see, therefore, the distances measured on the diameter, found a priori in Ch.","5174":"39, are confirmed by closely spaced and very reliable observations throughout the entire perimeter of the eccentric.","5175":"Chapter 57","5176":"By what natural principles the planet may be made to reciprocate as if on the diameter of an epicycle.","5177":"It is clear, then, from the most reliable observations, that the course of the planet through the aethereal air is not a circle, but an oval figure, and that it reciprocates on the diameter of a small circle in the following manner.","5178":"Suppose that, after describing equal arcs on the eccentric, the planet comes to be  at the diametral distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, instead of the circumferential distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1 (that is, \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1), upon which the perfect circle lies.","5179":"It is clear from inspection that a lunule is cut off from the perfect semicircle of the eccentric, whose breadth at any point is equal to the differences between the two diverse distances, such as \u03b9\u03ba, \u03bb\u03bc.","5180":"This is proposed not on the basis of arguments a priori, but of observations, as I have just said; so now the physical theories will proceed more correctly than they had hitherto.","5181":"***  For it is not by any ratiocinative or mental process that a planetary mind assigns the equal parts of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bc, \u03bc\u03b6, to equal arcs CD, DE, EF, of the as yet untraversed eccentric, for the former are not equal.","5182":"Instead, the reciprocation is coordinated with the space traversed on the eccentric in a natural way, which depends not upon the equality of the angles DBC, EBD, FBE, but upon the strength**1  of the ever increasing angle DBC, EBC, FBC, which strength approximates the sine (so called by the geometers).","5183":"The ascent\u2019s being changed into descent thereby gradually, by a continuous diminution, is more probably than if the planet were said suddenly to turn its prow in the other direction \u2013 which we indeed said in Ch.","5184":"39 clearly conflicts with observational results.","5185":"And since the measure of this reciprocation points the finger at a natural mode, its cause will also be natural; that is, it will be some natural \u2013 or better, corporeal \u2013 faculty, and not a planetary mind.","5186":"Also in Ch.","5187":"39, for the best reasons, one of our suppositions was that a planet cannot make a transition from place to place by the bare effort of its  inherent forces unless these be assisted or directed by an extrinsic force.","5188":"This being the case, we must consider whether we should also carry over this reciprocation in part to the solar power itself.","5189":"In our exertions to this end, we shall  be obliged once again to take up our oars which were introduced in Ch.","5190":"39 ^2.","5191":"Let there be a circular river CDE, FGH, and in it a sailor who revolves his oar once in twice the periodic time of the planet, by an inherent and perfectly uniform force.","5192":"Thus at C let the line of the oar be at right angles to the line from the sun, and let it direct now the bow and now the stern forward at alternate returns.","5193":"At F, however, let the line of the oar be part of the line from the sun, and at other positions let it have an intermediate inclination.","5194":"Now the stream, flowing down upon the oar at DE, will push the ship3 down towards A, while from C it will push very little, since the ship is also but slightly inclined.","5195":"The same is true at F, because at this moment the stream strikes the oar directly.","5196":"At D and E, however, it pushes down more strongly, because here the oar is greatly disposed to such an approach by its inclination.","5197":"The opposite happens in the ascending semicircle.","5198":"For the river, coming beneath the oar at G and H, drives it away from the sun.","5199":"At the same time it will also happen, other things being equal, that the impulse is less at C than at F, since our river is weak at C and strong at F.","5200":"And this is is also in accordance with our wishes, since our reciprocation was following equal spaces on the eccentric, and the planet spends longer in the upper ones than in the lower.","5201":"This example shows only the possibility of this arrangement.","5202":"In itself it  is rather inadequate, since the rotations of the oar and the river are accomplished, not in the same time, but a double time.","5203":"Furthermore, to those looking at them from earth, the faces of the planets should appear to change, while the face of the moon, although it participates with the planets in that motion which we are discussing, does not change over the course of a month.","5204":"Instead, it always is turned towards the earth, whence its eccentricity is reckoned.","5205":"In addition, while the force of a river is material (for its water acts by its weight and material impetus), the force of the sun is immaterial.","5206":"Therefore, the comparison with the planets ought to be different: they will need no oar, no physical instrument, for catching hold of the force of some weighty thing (for that motive species of the sun has no weight).","5207":"Nor do we deem it fitting that the stars have a corporeal oar, seeing that we hold them to be round.","5208":"But from this very refutation, there comes another example, which will perhaps be more suitable.","5209":"The river and the oar are of the same quality.","5210":"The river is an immaterial species of magnetic power in the sun.","5211":"So why not have the oar too borrow something from the magnet?","5212":"What if all the bodies of the planets are enormous round magnets?","5213":"Of the earth (one of the planets, for  Copernicus) there is no doubt.","5214":"William Gilbert has proved it.","5215":"But to describe this power more plainly, the planet\u2019s globe has two poles, of which one will seek out the sun, and the other will flee the  sun.","5216":"So let us imagine an axis of this sort as a magnetic strip, and let its point seek the sun.","5217":"But despite its sunseeking magnetic nature, let it remain ever parallel to itself in the translational motion of the globe, except to the extent that over the ages it transfers the polar inclination from one of the fixed  stars to another, thus causing the progressive motion of the aphelion.","5218":"I nevertheless admit the possibility that a mind may be needed for both of these, of such a nature as to be adequately instructed by the animate faculty for performing this motion.","5219":"For this is a motion, not of the entire body from place to place (which motion, in Ch.","5220":"39 above, was rightly denied to a motive cause inherent in the planets),4 but of the parts about the center of the whole, as if at rest.","5221":"Here again, in the globe of the earth there is an example of this directional property of the axis, from Copernicus.","5222":"For as long as the axis of the earth, in the annual circulation of its center, remains almost perfectly equidistant from  itself in all its positions, summer and winter are brought about.","5223":"* On the other hand, insofar as very long ages cause it to incline, the fixed stars are thought to move forward, and the equinoxes to retrogress.","5224":"Why, then, should we have doubts about attributing to all the planets, in order to save the phenomena of eccentricity, something that is observed to be in one of them (that is, the earth) because of the phenomena of the precession of the equinoxes and the sun's annual cycle of rising and falling?","5225":"Copernicus, for example, was deceived here when he thought that he needed a special principle to cause the earth to reciprocate annually from north to south and back so as to produce summer and winter, and to bring about the equality of the tropical and sidereal years (to the extent that they are equal) by constructing it in a manner commensurate with its revolution.","5226":"For all those effects are obtained by having the earth\u2019s axis, about which the diurnal motion is made, retain a single, constant direction: there is no need for extrinsic causes, except to account only for the extremely slow precession of the equinoxes.","5227":"And so here, too, there is on no account any need for movers for the planet, which would carry its body about the sun in a parallel position, and at the same time perform the reciprocation.","5228":"For the one will naturally depend upon the other.","5229":"The only thing remaining to be considered is the extremely slow progression of the aphelia.","5230":"To continue: when the strip is at C and F, there is no reason why the planet  should approach or recede, since it holds its ends at equal distances from the sun, and would undoubtedly turn its point towards the sun if it were allowed to do so by the force that holds its axis straight and parallel.","5231":"When the planet moves away from C, the point approaches the sun perceptibly, and the tail end recedes.","5232":"Therefore, the globe begins perceptibly to navigate towards the sun.","5233":"After F, the tail end perceptibly approaches, and the head end recedes from the sun.","5234":"Therefore, by a natural aversion, the whole globe perceptibly flees the sun.","5235":"And when it is opposite A, where the length of the axis is pointed directly at the sun, its approach in the former situation, or its flight in the latter, is strongest.","5236":"Furthermore, our earlier presuppositions derived from the observations postulated this.","5237":"For there, of the parts of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bc, \u03bc\u03b6 which correspond to equal arcs on the eccentric, the parts at the middle, such as \u03ba\u03bc, were longest, and those near \u03b3 and \u03b6 were short.","5238":"But it is also consistent that the observations would have \u03b3\u03ba, \u03bc\u03b6 equal, although their arcs \u03b3\u03b4, \u03b5\u03b6, or better, CD, EF on the eccentric, though equal, are traversed in unequal times, longer for CD, so that the part of the reciprocation \u03b3\u03ba is traversed in a longer time than \u03bc\u03b6 which is equal to it.","5239":"For similarly, magnets approach one another more slowly when they are at a greater interval, and more swiftly and more quickly at a shorter interval.","5240":"In fact, we can transfer that force which keeps the  magnetic axis in a parallel position, and does not allow it to remain pointed  towards the sun, from the attention of a mind, to which we had entrusted it a little earlier, to the functions of nature.","5241":"It appears to be an objection to this, that nature always acts in one and the same way, while this retentive force appears to make its exertions differently at different times.","5242":"This is seen, for  example, in the tendency of the axis to incline towards the sun, for the impeding of which the retentive force is ordained, which tendency is evanescent at the middle elongations but most strongly evident at aphelion and perihelion.","5243":"Nevertheless, what is there to prevent this force of retention's being in many places stronger than the tendency to incline towards the sun, so that the force is either not at all or but little wearied by such a weak adversary?","5244":"Let us again  take an example from the magnet.","5245":"In it are manifestly mingled two powers, one of directing it towards the pole, and the other of seeking iron.","5246":"Thus if a strip or nautical needle be directed towards the pole, while some iron approach from the side, the needle quickly declines from the pole and inclines towards the iron, thus indulging somewhat in its intimacy with the iron, but in such a way that it gives most of it to the pole.","5247":"Indeed, Gilbert thinks this  to be the reason why a strip declines from the pole towards the continents of greatest magnitude, the cause of this declination thus lying in the tracts of land, being greater and having a more vigorous power in the vicinity to the extent that they are higher on the right or left.","5248":"Therefore, we can ascribe the same tasks and a uniform action to both  natural faculties, and by the interplay of the two we can show a cause for the translation of the aphelia which will be neither obscure, nor, by Hercules, imaginary.","5249":"For suppose that this force of directing the axis towards the sun does detract somewhat from the retentive power, commensurate with the ratio of the two.","5250":"Accordingly, in the aphelial semicircle, as at C, the point will gradually incline towards H (that is, backward), and the tail end will turn away from the sun, gradually overcoming the retentive force.","5251":"Thus the aphelion will become retrograde.","5252":"But in the perihelial semicircle, as at F, the same point will incline towards G (that is, forward), again overcoming the contrary retentive force.","5253":"Thus the aphelion will then be made to move forward, and to be fast.","5254":"But because AF is shorter than AC, and the sun is closer to F than to C, the force tending to turn the magnetic axis towards the sun is therefore stronger at F than at C. Thus more will be detracted from the retentive [force] at F than at C. So the perihelial forward inclination not only compensates for  the aphelial backward inclination, but even overcomes it.","5255":"And so the reason is clear why the apsides progress, and do not retrogress.","5256":"Thus the aphelion we have found will have that value only at an equated anomaly of 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0 when the axis of power is directed straight at the sun, which is its correct place.","5257":"And the motion of the aphelion will be spiral, as will become clear below in Chapter 68 for the motion of precession of the equinoxes also, which exists through another cause.","5258":"So the direction of the magnetic axis in its parallel position, or the force which is its custodian, will not respect one or another of the fixed stars, but only the position of its body, as it is at any particular time.","5259":"And, to think the matter through simply: because this direction is more like rest than motion, it is more appropriately sought in the material, and in the disposition of the body, than in some mind.","5260":"But come: let us track more closely this similarity of the planetary  reciprocation to the motion of a magnet, and that by a most beautiful geometrical demonstration, so that it may be clear that magnets have such a motion as that which we perceive in the planet.","5261":"Let DFA be either a round magnet or the body of Mars, DA the line along which the magnetic power is oriented, D the pole that seeks the sun, A the pole that flees the sun.","5262":"You will note, first, that in this theory it is all the same whether we consider the entire globe of the magnetic body, or one single physical line of its power, parallel to DA.","5263":"For this magnetic power is corporeal, and divisible with the body, as the  Englishman Gilbert, B. Porta, and others, have proved,5 surely because its globe consists of an infinite number of physical lines, as it were, parallel to DA, whose power is extended in a straight line and in one direction in the world.","5264":"Therefore, the judgements made about individual parts with respect to the quality of their motion will be the same as those concerning them all joined together, and vice versa.","5265":"So let the central axis DA be proposed for theorizing, in place of the whole body and all its filaments.","5266":"Let DA be bisected at B, and let FBI be drawn perpendicular to DA.","5267":"Thus, when the planet is so positioned that BI points toward the center of the sun, there will be no [tendency to] approach.","5268":"For the angles DBI, ABI are equal, and thus have equal strength, the former for approaching, and the latter for receding.","5269":"So this is like an equipoise in mechanics ^6.","5270":"Under these conditions, the center of Mars B is on the apsides, at aphelion, say, at its greatest distance from the sun.","5271":"Now let some arc IC be taken, measuring the angle of equated anomaly, and let BC be drawn and extended to K. And let the planet be so situated that BC points towards the sun, which is understood to be indicated by K. The first  thing to be sought is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach.","5272":"Now the approach occurs because the seeking pole D is inclined towards the sun K at the angle DBK, while the fleeing pole A is turned away at the angle ABK.","5273":"And since the strength of this angle is natural, it will follow the same ratio as the balance.","5274":"But  when a line CP is drawn from C perpendicular to DA, between DP and PA there will be the ratio of the balance.","5275":"For if a pair of scales is suspended from the balance support KB, and the arms come to rest at the angle DBK, the weight of the arm BD will be to the weight of the arm BA as DP is to PA, just as, if the balance arms were suspended from CP at P, and the weight of the arm BA were applied to PD while the weight of BD were applied to PA, then DA would be at right angles to the hanging balance support CP.","5276":"See my Optics,7 and do not be easily swayed by insufficiently  careful experimentation.","5277":"Therefore, as DP is to PA, so is the strength of angle ABC to the strength of angle DBC.","5278":"Thus DP here measures the force of fleeing, and PA the seeking force.","5279":"From PA subtract a magnitude equal to DP, and let this be AS.","5280":"Therefore, SP is the measure of the seeking power alone, with the impediment of fleeing [power] subtracted, and it will be in the same proportion in which AD measures the single greatest force.","5281":"But where the half DB measures the greatest force, the half of PS, which is PB, or the sine CN of the equated anomaly CBI, measures the net force of the planet's approach towards the sun at this location.","5282":"So the sine of the equated anomaly is the measure of the strength of the planet's approach towards the sun in this place.","5283":"And this is the measure of the increments of power.","5284":"The measure of the distance of the reciprocation traversed by these continuous increments of power is quite another thing.","5285":"For the observations show that if the eccentric anomaly GI corresponds to the equated anomaly IC, the versed sine IH of the arc GI is the measure of the reciprocation accomplished.","5286":"If this can also be deduced from the previously indicated measure of the speed CN, then we shall have reconciled experience with the demonstration involving the balance.","5287":"Since the sine of any arc is the measure of the strength of that angle, the sum of the sines will be an approximate measure of the sum of the strengths or impressions over all the equal parts of the circle.","5288":"And the completion of the entire reciprocation is the effect of all of these in common.","5289":"Furthermore, letting IC and IG,  though they are unequal elsewhere, be equal here to avoid confusion, the sum of the sines of the arc IG is to the sum of the sines over the quadrant, approximately as the versed sine IH of that arc IG is to the versed sine IB of the quadrant.","5290":"Approximately, I say.","5291":"For at the beginning, when both the versed sine and its increments are small, it is less by half than the sum of the sines.","5292":"For: Let the quadrant be taken as 90 units.","5293":"The sum of the 90 sines is 5,789,431 ^8.","5294":"In this instance I have added them all in order ^9.","5295":"The sum of the sines at an arc of 1\u00b0, that is, the first sine, is 1745.","5296":"And the former sum is to the latter as 100,000 is to 30.","5297":"On the other hand, the versed sine of the quadrant is 100,000, and the versed sine of 1 degree is 15, which is half of 30.","5298":"The reader should not be at all deterred by this geometrical faux pas10 and  fallacious principle.","5299":"For before this becomes a perceptible portion of the reciprocation, the effects of the two procedures differ imperceptibly.","5300":"For the sum of 15 sines, which is 208,166, gives 359411 [as a fourth proportional].","5301":"And the versed sine of 15\u00b0 gives 3407\/100,000, which is only a little less than the other.","5302":"Likewise, the sum of 30 sines, which is 792,598, shows, by the rule of proportions, a part of the reciprocation which is 13,691 out of 100,000.","5303":"And the versed sine of 30\u00b0 shows 13,397.","5304":"Also, the sum of 60 sines, which is 2,908,017, shows a little more than 50,000, while the versed sine of 60\u00b0 is 50,000 ^12.","5305":"It has been demonstrated that if any magnet be set out as we have  supposed the bodies of the planets to be set out in the heavens with respect to the sun, a reciprocation of the magnetic body will result that is such as is measured by the versed sine, as regards the space traversed.","5306":"And indeed, the observations testify that the planet's body reciprocates according to the measure of the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly.","5307":"It is therefore perfectly consistent that the bodies of the planets be magnetic, and so disposed to the sun as we have described.","5308":"I must now show that it was not a great mistake to have taken the arcs IC  and IG as equal.","5309":"When I say that the arc IC on the body of the planet is the measure  of the equated anomaly, I am speaking properly, and CN is then the genuine measure of the strength possessed by the planet when it has the sun on the line BK.","5310":"However, when I say that IG is the measure of the eccentric anomaly which corresponds to the [equated] anomaly IC, I am speaking improperly, incorrectly using the circle of the planet's body to represent the eccentric.","5311":"But on the eccentric's descending semicircle, since a greater arc of eccentric anomaly corresponds to  a smaller arc of equated anomaly (namely, IG to IC), we will be adding up considerably more sines on IG than on IC, and rightly so.","5312":"For since the sine measures the strength, and the strength acts in proportion to the time and to the closeness to the sun (magnets being stronger when closer)\u2014that is, to put it briefly, in proportion to the arc IG\u2014just as many sines should be set up on IC as are found on IG.","5313":"Our only error is this, that we take those many sines to be longer than they should be, as GH is longer than CN.","5314":"But first of all this excess is in itself very small and imperceptible.","5315":"For at the beginning of the quadrant the arcs IC and IG hardly differ, and the sines are small, and at the end of the quadrant, where the eccentric equation CG is greatest, the sines hardly differ.","5316":"And then this error is in accord with our wishes.","5317":"For the sums of the sines  always come out a little greater than the versed sines; and here we are keen to accommodate and reconcile the libratory and magnetic ratios to those commended by experience.","5318":"Therefore, this present error of ours, of accumulating long sines instead of short ones, is avoided if we use the versed sines instead of the sums of the sines themselves, for the sums of the sines are not exactly equal to the versed sines, but exceed them because of the effect of the reciprocation.","5319":"Therefore, by the best reasoning at our disposal, we have brought the calculation within the limits of observable error ^13.","5320":"Let us conclude that the body of the planet, like a magnet, approaches and recedes according to the law of the lever along an imaginary diameter of the epicycle tending towards the sun, and that the body's diameter of power, its true diameter DA, tends towards the middle elongations, so that for this time BD tends toward 29\u00b0 Taurus BA towards 29\u00b0 Scorpio.","5321":"Thus this reciprocational approach is performed without the action of mind, by a magnetic force which, though it inheres in the planet and is independent, nevertheless depends for its definition upon the extrinsic body of the sun.","5322":"For the force is defined as seeking the sun or fleeing it.","5323":"And while the force between magnets tending to bring them together ought to be mutual, I have denied, in Chapter 39 above, that the sun has the planets' attracting force: it was instead understood to be purely attractive only, as is clear from the argument presented there ^14.","5324":"The planets' force, on the other hand, is supposed to be simultaneously attractive on one side and repulsive on the other.","5325":"Alternatively, one might suppose that the sun, like unmagnetized iron, is only sought after, and does not in turn seek other things.","5326":"For in the above passage, its filaments were circular, while those of the planets are here supposed to be straight.","5327":"I am satisfied if this magnetic example demonstrates the general possibility of the proposed mechanism.","5328":"Concerning its details, however, I have doubts.","5329":"For when the earth is in question, it is certain that its axis, whose constant  and parallel direction brings about the year's seasons at the cardinal points, is not well suited to bringing about this reciprocation or this aphelion.","5330":"The sun's apogee, or earth's aphelion, today closely coincides with the solstitial points, and not with the equinoctial, which would fit our theory; nor will it have remained at a constant distance from the cardinal points.","5331":"And if this axis is unsuitable, it seems that there is none suitable in the earth's entire body, since there is no part of it which rests in the same position while the whole body of the globe revolves in a ceaseless daily whirl about that axis.","5332":"So indeed, there may be absolutely no material, magnetic faculty that can accomplish the tasks entrusted to the planets individually, since there may be a lack of means, that is, no suitable diameter of the body which remains equidistant to itself as the body is moved around.","5333":"For this lack has just been made apparent in one of the planets, namely, the globe of the earth.","5334":"Therefore, let a mind be summoned, which, as was said in Chapter 39, arrives at a knowledge of the distances it traverses by contemplating the growth of the sun's diameter ^15.","5335":"Let this mind govern a faculty, either animate or natural, that keeps its globe in a parallel position in a manner allowing it to be suitably impelled by the solar power and to reciprocate with respect to the sun.","5336":"(For a mere mind, unassisted by a faculty of a lower order, could not by itself do anything in a body.16) At the same time care should be taken that the periodic time of the reciprocation not be made exactly equal to the periodic return of the planet, so that the apsides will move.","5337":"The plausibility of these things is argued in Chapter 39 above ^17.","5338":"Now that we have obtained from the observations the laws and quantitative characteristics of this reciprocation by which the sun's apparent diameter is varied, matters of which we were still ignorant in Ch.","5339":"39, it remains for us to see whether those laws may be such that the planets may plausibly know them.","5340":"The laws of the reciprocation were that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly is the measure of the part of the reciprocation completed.","5341":"To begin, therefore, I say that admitting as given  the observational evidence, namely, that after equal arcs of the eccentric are traversed, the planet is found at \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6 rather than at \u03b3, \u03b9, \u03bb, \u03b6, the increment of the sun's diameter presents a legitimate measure of the versed sine of the equated anomaly,18 no less so than we know the versed sines of the eccentric anomaly to be a measure of the reciprocation.","5342":"Now, as was said in Ch.","5343":"39,19 the planet's mind (if it has such an adjunct) perceives the spaces it traverses in the reciprocation in no other way than by the evidence provided by the increase of the sun's diameter.","5344":"It will therefore be fitting that it know the versed sine of the equated anomaly, in order that by approaching it might increase the sun's diameter to its prescribed size.","5345":"The proof is as follows.","5346":"Let the planet be at \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6 after traversing equal arc of the imperfect eccentric CD, DE, EF, and let the points D and H be joined, the line intersecting the diameter CF at I. Therefore, since the straight lines \u03b4\u03ba\u03b8, \u03b5\u03bc\u03b7 cut the {marginal:","5347":"277} epicycle into arcs similar to those on the eccentric, by construction, as CF is to CI, so will \u03b3\u03b6 be to \u03b3\u03ba, one section being a measure of the other.","5348":"These things being so, I say it will also follow that the diameters of the sun at \u03b1, as observed from \u03b3, \u03ba, \u03bc, \u03b6, will be augmented by the same measure, namely, the measure by which the versed sine of the equated anomaly increases.","5349":"It would be inconvenient to prove this solidly here.","5350":"It will, however, easily be understood as holding solidly if we prove it for both ends and the middle.","5351":"At C the equated anomaly is nothing, and the versed sine is nothing, and the sun, observed from \u03b3, appears at its minimum, so that the amount of its increase is again nothing.","5352":"At F the equated anomaly is 180\u00b0.","5353":"The versed sine is equal to the whole diameter, 200,000.","5354":"And the sun, observed from \u03b6, appears at its maximum, so that it shall have acquired all of its increase.","5355":"Now for an equated anomaly of 90\u00b0, from A let AM be set up perpendicular to CF, and let MB be joined.","5356":"Also, from \u03b1 let a line be drawn tangent to the epicycle at \u03bd, and the tangent point \u03bd be joined with the center \u03b2. Now since \u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 is right, by Euclid III.","5357":"18, and MAB is right by construction, and \u03b2\u03bd, BA are equal by construction, as well as \u03b2\u03b1, BM, therefore, the triangles are equal and congruent.","5358":"So \u03bd\u03b2\u03b1, ABM are equal.","5359":"From \u03bd let \u03bd\u03bf be drawn perpendicular to \u03b3\u03b6.","5360":"Therefore, since \u03bd\u03bf\u03b2 is right, it is equal to MAB, and \u03bd\u03b2\u03bf will be equal to MBA.","5361":"So the triangles are similar, and as \u03bd\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03bf, so is MB to BA, and vice versa.","5362":"And since \u03bd\u03b2, \u03b2\u03b3, and \u03b2\u03b6 are equal, and also MB, BC, and BF, as \u03bd\u03b2, \u03b2\u03bf together, or \u03b3\u03bf, is to \u03bf\u03b6, so are MB, BA together, or CA, to AF.","5363":"Therefore, since CA is the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly CBM, and is supposed to be the measure of the corresponding part of the reciprocation, \u03b3\u03bf will be that part.","5364":"Therefore, at this eccentric anomaly CBM, or equated anomaly CAM of 90\u00b0, the planet will be at \u03bf.","5365":"But the versed sine of the equated anomaly of 90\u00b0, the angle CAM, is half the total diameter, or 100,000.","5366":"I say also that the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the sun at A, \u03b1, as seen from \u03bf, will be a mean between the magnitudes as seen from \u03b3 and \u03b6, so that it shall have acquired half of its increase when the planet is at \u03bf below","5367":"\u03b2.","5368":"For let the diameter of the sun's body be \u03b1\u03be, and the apparent angles formed by joining \u03be with \u03b6, \u03bf, \u03b3, be \u03be\u03b6\u03b1, \u03be\u03bf\u03b1, \u03be\u03b3\u03b1.","5369":"And because AF, \u03b6\u03b1 are equal, as well as AC, \u03b1\u03b3, and as CA is to AF, so is \u03b3\u03bf to \u03bf\u03b6, therefore, as \u03b3\u03b1 is to \u03b1\u03b6 so is \u03b3\u03bf to \u03bf\u03b6.","5370":"But \u03b3\u03be differs imperceptibly from \u03b3\u03b1, and \u03b6\u03be from \u03b6\u03b1.","5371":"Therefore, as \u03b3\u03be is to \u03b6\u03be, so is \u03b3\u03bf to \u03bf\u03b6, within the limits of perception.","5372":"So in the triangle \u03b3\u03be\u03b6, the angle \u03be is divided by the line \u03be\u03bf so that the base \u03b3\u03b6 is divided in the same ratio as the sides \u03b3\u03be, \u03b6\u03be.","5373":"Therefore, by the converse of Euclid VI.","5374":"3, the angle \u03b3\u03be\u03b6 is divided into two equal parts by the line \u03be\u03bf, and \u03b3\u03be\u03bf is half of \u03b3\u03be\u03b6, the total increase of the sun's diameter.","5375":"Q. E. D. It is therefore certain at both ends and the middle that in this way, if the diameter of the reciprocation is divided by the planet in proportion to the versed sines of the eccentic anomaly, the sun's diameter would increase in  proportion to the versed sines of the equated anomaly.","5376":"To make it more evident, this is clear in part from the following.","5377":"Let the straight line BL be drawn from B perpendicular to CF, and about center A, with radius equal to BC, let an arc be drawn intersecting BL at L, and let AL be joined.","5378":"Since the eccentric anomaly CBL is 90\u00b0, the versed sine will be CB, 100,000, half of the whole diameter, and consequently the reciprocation will be \u03b3\u03b2, half of the whole \u03b3\u03b6.","5379":"Also, the distance will be \u03b2\u03b1.","5380":"But AL is equal to it by construction.","5381":"Thus the planet will be at L. And because AL is equal to BC or BM, and BA is a common side, and LBA is right, as well as MAB, therefore, the triangles BMA, ALB are congruent.","5382":"So BL is equal to AM.","5383":"But AM is equal to \u03b1\u03bd, as above, and therefore BL is equal to it also.","5384":"But \u03b1\u03bd, which lies opposite the right angle \u03b1\u03bf\u03bd, is longer than \u03b1\u03bf, which subtends the acute angle \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf.","5385":"Therefore, BL is also longer than \u03b1\u03bf, and AL is longer than BL.","5386":"Thus AL is much longer than \u03b1\u03bf.","5387":"Therefore, the sun appears smaller at the distance AL than at the distance \u03b1\u03bf.","5388":"But the distance \u03b1\u03bf was just now seen to be the mean between the maximum and the minimum.","5389":"Thus at distance AL the sun appears less than the mean.","5390":"So at L, even though half the semicircle of the eccentric has been traversed, less than half of the increase has been added to the sun's diameter.","5391":"This is, of course, because the equated anomaly LAC is less than the half, 90\u00b0.","5392":"And this was the problem that had tied us in knots in Ch.","5393":"39, as was said in the preceding chapter (Ch.","5394":"56).","5395":"For if the planet's orbit had been a perfect circle, the increase of the sun's diameter would have been a measure of the increases of the versed sines of the eccentric anomaly, whose observation is more foreign to the planet's mind than is the observation of the equated anomaly, as we shall shortly hear.","5396":"You can see from this contrast just how conveniently this measure is attributed to the planet, and how plausibly.","5397":"We might suppose that the measure of the reciprocation (the versed sine  of the eccentric anomaly, as the observations show) is to be grasped directly by the mind.","5398":"But then the planet's mind would be deprived of the assistance of the variable solar diameter, because it does not adjust itself to the versed sines of this anomaly of the eccentric.","5399":"For the planet's path is not a circle.","5400":"And the planet's mind would have to intuit the parts of the reciprocation, or the distances to be traversed in them, without any indicators.","5401":"This we long ago rejected as absurd.","5402":"It would also have to intuit the eccentric anomaly, which is the angle between two straight lines projected from the center of the eccentric, one through the aphelial point and the other through the center of the planetary globe.","5403":"In the diagram, it is DBC (or if the line DK be projected from D parallel to BC, KDB is then the supplement of the same eccentric anomaly).","5404":"Therefore, if the mind perceives the angle KDB, it must perceive the triad of the points K, D, B. Concerning the point D there is no problem, since it is the center of its globe.","5405":"I am not much concerned about K, because, owing to the infinite distance of the fixed stars, BC and DK ultimately coincide at the same  location among the fixed stars, and the fixed stars are real bodies.","5406":"Therefore there is no absurdity in holding that the planet\u2019s mind uses some hidden sense to keep in view that fixed star which provides lodging for the aphelion at any planet\u2019s mind, because B is not clothed in any body.","5407":"Furthermore, when one removes the cause for keeping watch on B, the effect is also removed.","5408":"But B ought to be watched if the circle CD is to be traversed.","5409":"However, the planets' orbits are not perfectly circular, as was proven from the observations in Chapter 42.","5410":"Therefore, the planets do not take aim at B. And thus this putative center B is actually secondary to the path CD.","5411":"But if it were watched by the planet, it would be prior to the path.","5412":"For these reasons, therefore, I deny that the versed sine of the eccentric anomaly provides the planet with a measure of its reciprocation, not because this is not such a measure, but because even if it is, it is not discerned by the planet's mind.","5413":"But if we suppose it to be the increasing and decreasing of the sun's diameter that serves as the means or aid by which the planet arrives at the correct distances (imperceptible in themselves) in its reciprocations, and then for the variation of this diameter of the sun, from the demonstration just completed, we posit a rule or measure, to be perceived by the planet's mind, [namely,] the equated anomaly of the eccentric, DAC, or rather, KDA, in the diagram,  we now stand closer to the truth.","5414":"For both measures are perceptible: for the reciprocation, the increasing and decreasing magnitude of the sun's diameter, and for the measure, or angle, three points clothed in bodies.","5415":"For at A there is the sun itself, at D the planet, and at K the fixed star that indicates the aphelia.","5416":"Perhaps it ought therefore to be said (as indeed we also just embraced above in Ch.","5417":"39, when we supposed that the forces of Nature were insufficient to administer the celestial motions) that there is attributed to the planet an ability to sense the light of the fixed stars and the sun, the confluence of whose radiations at the center of the planetary body gives an estimate of this angle of equated anomaly ^20.","5418":"There is but one difficulty to clear up.","5419":"For what reason is it not the angle itself  that is made to be the measure of the planetary operation (that is, to make the sun's diameter increase by approaching the sun), but the versed sine in place of the angle?","5420":"*21  And by what means might the planet perceive the sine of the equated anomaly?","5421":"Does it proceed in the way humans do, by geometrical reasoning?","5422":"Nevertheless, hitherto no faculty of administering the celestial motions belongs to the planet's mind that could not have been acquired by a divine inspiration imparted at the very beginning of the world and lasting even to this day, without any reasoning whatever.","5423":"Therefore, what was said just above should be repeated, namely that the sine of the equated anomaly is the index of the strength of the angles KDA: on this point, see Aristotle's Mechanics,22 and what was said above in this chapter.","5424":"For when the two balance arms are disposed at an obtuse angle, they are more easily directed than when they are at a right angle, the ease of direction being proportional to the sines.","5425":"And, on the other hand, when the two arms are connected at an acute angle, they are more easily made to move together into a single line, head-to-head, than if they were connected at a right angle.","5426":"Refer again to the demonstration contained in what was just presented.","5427":"Thus, in one way, if it makes sense for the planet to have a sense of the strength of the  angles, there will be no absurdity in our saying (using our human conception) that the sines of the angles are known to it.","5428":"But why would it take note of the natural strength of the angles?","5429":"(We are evidently returning to natural principles).","5430":"As before, let there be certain regions of the planetary body in which there is a magnetic force of direction along a line tending towards the sun.","5431":"However, contrary to the previous case, let it be an attribute, not of the nature of the body, but of an animate faculty of the sort that governs the body of the planet from within, that as it is swept along by the sun, it keeps that  magnetic axis always directed at the same fixed stars, except to the extent that it turns the axis a little over the ages.","5432":"The result will be a battle between the animate faculty and the magnetic faculty, and the animate will win.","5433":"It is no different from what we had said in Ch.","5434":"34, that the bodies of the planets naturally seek rest, but are moved by the extrinsic force of the sun.","5435":"Alternatively, here is a more apt example.","5436":"The weight of the human arm naturally tends towards the center of the earth.","5437":"However, in a flag bearer the animate faculty takes over and makes the weight extend over his head and wave in a circulatory motion.","5438":"Here the animate faculty overcomes the natural weight, and would do so forever if the body of the flag-bearer together with all its faculties had not been created mortal.","5439":"On the basis of these presuppositions, the planet's mind will be able to intuit and perceive the strength of the angle from the wrestling match between the animate faculty, which is designed to keep the magnetic axis in line, and the magnetic power of directing it towards the sun.","5440":"This arrangement seems also to be confirmed by the example of the moon, which is incontestably more strongly propelled when it is on the diametral line of the sun and the earth, perhaps because of this strength of the angles.","5441":"The final conclusion, then, will be this.","5442":"A planet situated at aphelion makes no endeavor in the direction of the sun, but is carried along in proportion to the distance AC.","5443":"The angle KDA results from its forward motion.","5444":"In accord with the proportion of strength of this angle, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase by approaching the sun.","5445":"In its approach, it diminishes the distance, making it AD.","5446":"Since the distance is diminished, the forward motion is increased.","5447":"Therefore, the angle KDA is changed more rapidly.","5448":"Therefore, the planet causes the sun's diameter to increase more rapidly (other things being equal).","5449":"Thus is established a perpetual circulation which does not occur by leaps such as we have supposed in our thinking and calculation, ignoring imperceptible errors, but is quite continuous.","5450":"What I have said so far holds conditionally, if the reciprocation supported by the observations cannot be performed by some magnetic power, implanted in the bodies of the planets, and if it has become absolutely necessary for us to have recourse to a mind.","5451":"Otherwise, if a comparison between the natural motion and the mental one is in order, the former stands on its own, requiring nothing external, while the latter, the mental motion, appears to give evidence of the magnetic one, and to require its assistance, no matter how you equip it with an animate faculty of moving the body.","5452":"For in the first place, mind by itself can do nothing to a body.","5453":"It is therefore necessary to provide for the mind an adjunct faculty that performs its functions in making the planet's body reciprocate.","5454":"This faculty will be either animate or natural and magnetic.","5455":"It cannot be animate, for an animate faculty cannot transport its body from place to place (as this reciprocation requires) without the power of another assisting body.","5456":"Therefore, it will be a magnetic, that is, natural, faculty of sympathy between the bodies of the planet and the sun.","5457":"Thus the mind calls upon nature and the magnets for assistance.","5458":"Second, at the halfway point in its pattern, which is the equated anomaly, it has traversed a greater part \u03b3\u03bf of its reciprocation above, and a smaller part \u03bf\u03b6 below, while completing half of its task, which consists of increasing or decreasing the sun's diameter.","5459":"Nor do \u03b3\u03bf, \u03bf\u03b6 correspond to parts of the time.","5460":"For more time is consumed on \u03b3\u03bf than its excess over \u03bf\u03b6 required.","5461":"Nor do the parts increase continuously from \u03b6 to \u03b3, the ones about \u03b3, \u03ba being smaller, as well as those about \u03bc, \u03b6. The operations of mind, however, are accustomed to being constant.","5462":"There was consequently a need for us to equip the mind with an animate faculty, as well as a magnetic one, and to contrive a battle between the two which would remind the mind of its duties, of which it could not have been reminded by the equality of either the times or the spaces traversed.","5463":"So again we have asked nature to assist the mind.","5464":"On the other hand, all these modifications really appertain to the workings of the sun's extrinsic magnetic power, and of the magnetic [power] joined to it, which inheres in the planet, as was explained above.","5465":"If, therefore, the magnetic powers can do the job on their own, what need have they of the directing function of mind?","5466":"Although we have remained uncertain about the magnetic force inherent in the planetary bodies, through our consideration of the earth's axis, which is different from the sun's line of apsides, this difficulty is common to both explanations.","5467":"For even when we supposed a mind, we were compelled to admit the kind of axis that we wanted in the earth, through whose mediation the mind could apprehend the strength of the angle, or its versed sine.","5468":"On the contrary, probability strongly urges us to ascribe this reciprocation of the planets, which without doubt is in accord with the laws of nature, entirely to nature, whatever may be the means by which it occupies the planet's bodies.","5469":"Moreover, I do not know whether I have given sufficient proof to the philosophical reader of this perceptual cognition of the sun and the fixed stars, which I myself so easily accept, and bestow upon the planet's mind.","5470":"Furthermore, in those very modes of operation which we have prescribed to the mind, the soundest of all those which were deemed possible appear to involve some geometrical uncertainty.","5471":"I am not sure whether this might not be repudiated by God Himself, as to this point He has always been seen to proceed by the path of demonstration.","5472":"For if a planet, insofar as it may have approached the sun partly by its inherent force, comes into one and another degree of extrinsic power from the sun (as it does indeed come); and if the different degrees also reciprocally intensify the planet's own force of approaching while they increase the angle, which is posited as the standard of measure23 of the approach, or of the increase of the sun's diameter; then the planet's own striving finally becomes in part its own measure, and simultaneously prior and posterior in the intensification of the planet['s force].","5473":"For in its parts it is unequal, and for this reason it requires a measure.","5474":"Thus, the search for the forces tempering both powers will be concluded by a kind of iterative method24 rather than deductively, so that they may complete their cycles in the same time, and in the same revolution of the body.","5475":"Someone might, however, want to think he had found the cause of the  progression of the aphelia in the ungeometrical25 nature of this measure.","5476":"But in Ch.","5477":"35 we left it undecided whether this category of motion might not  exist through another cause, namely, occultation ^26.","5478":"That is, just as a plate of iron intercepts the force of a magnet on a strip of iron, the bodies of the planets might also mutually intercept the magnetic powers proper to them, by which they incline towards the sun.","5479":"And so that this might not happen to the solar power\u2014so that, I mean, the solar power, common to all, could not be intercepted for one planet by the interposition of another\u2014we have drawn a distinction between the essence of the solar body and that of the planets' bodies.","5480":"So, since we have not drawn a distinction between the bodies of the planets themselves, this seems still to be a possible cause.","5481":"It could, of course, not have been arranged thus unless the exact magnetic disposition of the planet's body, by which the reciprocation is administered, were known.","5482":"But to give an example of reasoning: let the planet have a magnetic disposition of the sort which, though we had introduced it somewhat earlier, we later denied the earth to possess.","5483":"In this disposition, impediment through occultation does not have any place.","5484":"For because it was the effect of the magnetic power to tend towards the sun and to recede from the sun, meanwhile keeping the fibers of its magnetic seat in line, if another planet, coming between the sun and the planet, impedes this travel towards the sun, or recession from it, while not impeding the common motion from the sun, the planet will approach or recede less than it should, and thus the size of the circuit will be altered along with the periodic time, over the ages, and will again be corrected by contrary eclipses.","5485":"However, the aphelion will not change position through this occultation.","5486":"So the cause for the motion of the aphelia previously proposed by us still reigns alone, without peer or rival.","5487":"Further, if a mind should preside over the reciprocation in the manner described, occultation will still do no harm.","5488":"For as was said, the mind would use the angle of equated anomaly as its measure for increasing the sun's diameter; and, while deprived of the perception of it for a slight amount of time (that is, while the sun is hidden), it would be possible (the gods willing) to compensate for what the mind would have missed, upon the sun's re-emerging and restoring the equated anomaly into view.","5489":"For mind (where there is one) is master of the animate faculty, and uses it differently and unequally according to circumstances.","5490":"So why should it not use the animate faculty in an unusual manner here too, in removing the discrepancy between the measure (the equated anomaly) and the measured quantity (the sun's diameter) which had insinuated itself through the means of the sun's eclipse?","5491":"What about other slow motions of this kind, such as the precession of the equinoxes arising from the earth's axis being directed at one or another of the fixed stars, and not at the sun?","5492":"For here, the removal of the sun's light can have no effect, since its presence has no effect either.","5493":"We would like to avoid the inconvenient effects of magnetic occultations  upon the reciprocations proper to the planets, just as we did in Ch.","5494":"35 for the common revolving effect of the sun.","5495":"It should therefore be said that the bodies of the planets can indeed be similar in their magnetic dispositions, but either (1) they are so far from one another that the planets' orbs of power would not overlap, or (2) the power coming from the sun is so strong (that which activates the planets' proper powers no less than that which makes them revolve in their orbs) that it could not be impeded at all by the interposition of a small, weak body, so that it would pass on through, just as light passes through a globe  of water, or (3) the bodies of the planets are so meager that they would have no effect, nor is the sun ever substantially blocked by any planet for any of the other planets moved by the sun, as the sun is never substantially blocked from the earth by the moon.","5496":"For although the whole sun can be covered for the moon for several hours, the moon performs its reciprocation with respect to the earth, not the sun, and it can never be deprived of its perception of the earth since there is no body between the earth and the moon.","5497":"Nevertheless, it might appear plausible to someone that the transposition  of the apogees is instantaneous, and occurs through the cause of the sun's being eclipsed.","5498":"Let him say, if he please, that to prevent the reciprocation's undergoing a sudden leap of speed when it is interrupted by an eclipse, during which the planet is moved by the sun to another angle and another degree of its strength, this angular leap is compensated by the planet itself, by having its axis incline towards the sun at the same angle after the eclipse as it was at the beginning of the eclipse.","5499":"For thus a transposition of the aphelia will be obtained, but one occurring by leaps, and remaining in the same sidereal position for many years, until there happens to be another occultation of the planet.","5500":"On the other hand, the prior cause of the transposition of the aphelia,  arising from the reciprocation's aberration from its sidereal circuit, produced by the ungeometrical27 interconnection of its components, favors the uniform transposition of the apogees.","5501":"Finally, if neither of these causes obtains, let the mind, furnished with an  animate faculty which presides over the constant direction of the magnetic axis, have the additional task of inclining the axis over the ages.","5502":"But if none of these causes stands, nor even the general idea of a mind, let us be satisfied with nature, which, as she has allowed everything else to be disentangled, has also shown a splendid occasion for the motion of the aphelia.","5503":"Chapter 58","5504":"In what manner, while the reciprocation discovered and demonstrated in Chapter 56 holds good, an error may nevertheless be introduced in a wrongheaded application of the reciprocation, whereby the path of the planet is made puff-cheeked.","5505":"With an apple Galatea seeks me, the lusty wench:","5506":"She flees to the willows, but hopes I'll see her first ^1.","5507":"It is perfectly right that I borrow Virgil's voice to sing this about Nature.","5508":"For the closer the approach to her, the more petulant her games become, and the more she again and again sneaks out of the seeker's grasp just when he is about to seize her through more twists.","5509":"Nevertheless, she does not cease to invite me to seize her, as though delighting in my mistakes.","5510":"Throughout this entire work, my aim has been to find a physical hypothesis that not only will produce distances in agreement with those observed,  but also, and at the same time, sound equations, which hitherto we have been driven to borrow from the vicarious hypothesis of Chapter 16.","5511":"So, while trying to use a false method to do the same thing through this hypothesis, which is itself perfectly correct, I began once again to fear for the whole undertaking.","5512":"On the line of apsides, about centers A and B, let the equal circles GD, HK be described.","5513":"And let AB be the eccentricity of the circle GD.","5514":"Also, let the eccentric anomaly, or its number of degrees, be the arc GD or HK, by the equivalence established in Chapter 3.","5515":"Next, about center K, with radius KD which shall be equal to AB, let the epicycle LDF be described, which will intersect the circle GD at D, through the equivalence established in Ch.","5516":"3.","5517":"Let AK be drawn, and extended to intersect the epicycle at L, so that the arc LD is similar to the eccentric anomaly GD or HK.","5518":"And let BD be joined.","5519":"Now, from D let perpendiculars be drawn to GA, LA, and let these be DC, DE.","5520":"Therefore, by what has previously been demonstrated in Ch.","5521":"56, AE will indubitably be the correct distance at this eccentric anomaly.","5522":"The question remains how much time was taken to arrive at it.","5523":"Now the versed sine of its arc, GC, which, after multiplication, becomes LE, when subtracted from GA, yielded the correct distance AE.","5524":"These indications persuaded me that the other end of AE should be sought, not on the line DC (which was actually perfectly correct), but at the point I of the line DB, such that if I were to draw the arc EIF about center A with radius AE, it would intersect DB at I. Thus, according to this persuasion, AI would be the correct distance, both in position and length, and IAG would be the true equated anomaly.","5525":"But it is manifest that the arc EIF would intersect the line DC at a higher place, namely, at F. Thus the angles IAG and FAG differ by the quantity IAF.","5526":"I therefore erred in taking the line AI instead of AF ^2.","5527":"I first discovered the error empirically.","5528":"For when I explored the quantity of the area DAG, either using all the distances or using the small area DAB, and then fitted the angle IAG, rather than FAG, to this area DAG, now converted into time, in the upper part of the semicircle I found 5\u00bd\u2019 more, and in the lower half 4' less, than the vicarious hypothesis gave with sufficient certainty.","5529":"And so, since the equations disagreed with the truth, I began once more to accuse these perfectly correct distances AE, and the planet's reciprocation LE, of the crime for which my false method, which took I in place of F, was to be blamed.","5530":"What need is there for many words?","5531":"The very truth, and the nature of things, though repudiated and ordered into exile, sneaked in again through the back door, and was received by me under an unwonted guise.","5532":"That is, I rejected the reciprocation on the diameter LE, and began by recalling the ellipses, quite convinced that I was thus following an hypothesis far, far different from the reciprocation, although they coincide exactly, as will be demonstrated in the following chapter.","5533":"The only difference was that the errors I committed in method earlier were corrected by this procedure, and that F was used instead of I, as it should have been.","5534":"My line of reasoning was like that presented in Ch.","5535":"49, 50, and 56.","5536":"The circle of Ch.","5537":"43 errs in excess, while the ellipse of Chapter 45 errs in defect.","5538":"And the excess of the former and the defect of the latter are equal.","5539":"But the only figure occupying the middle between a circle and an ellipse is another  ellipse.","5540":"Therefore, the ellipse is the path of the planet, and the lunule cut off from the semicircle has half the breadth of the previous one, namely, 429.","5541":"Moreover, if the planet's path were an ellipse, it was clear enough that I could not be taken in place of F, for if this is done, the planet's path is made to be puff-cheeked ^3.","5542":"For let the angles QBP, SAR in the lower part be equal to GBD, HAK, and about center R let the epicycle PT again be described, equal to the previous one, and from P, the intersection of the epicycle with the eccentric, let perpendiculars PV, PM, be dropped to BQ, AR [respectively], and let PB be joined.","5543":"And about center A, with radius AM, let the arc MN be described, intersecting PV at O, and PB at N. So, by analogy with the above, just as we are taking I in place of F, let us now take N for O, and let us consider that just as AN is the correct distance in length, it is also correct in position.","5544":"Now the points I, N, and the like do indeed make the planet's path puff-cheeked.","5545":"For the arcs GD and QP are equal.","5546":"And BD, BP, projected from a common center, intersect the lunule cut off.","5547":"But DI and PN, the breadths of the lunule extended towards the center, are unequal.","5548":"And DI is smaller, and PN greater.","5549":"For since ED and MP are equal, and EDI, MPN are right, while EI is a greater circle, since its radius AE is greater, and MN is a smaller circle, since its radius AM is smaller, therefore, PN will definitely be greater, and DI smaller.","5550":"Therefore, the lunule cut off is narrower above, at D, and broader below, at P. In the ellipse, in contrast, this lunule is of equal breadth at points equally removed from the apsides G and Q. So it is clear that the path is puff-cheeked, so it is not an ellipse.","5551":"And since the ellipse gives the correct equations, this puff-cheeked path should by rights give incorrect ones.","5552":"Nor was there any need to compute the equations anew from the ellipse.","5553":"I knew they were going to perform their function without further prompting.","5554":"I was only concerned about the distances, that if they were taken from the ellipse they might cause me trouble.","5555":"But although this did happen, I had already prepared a refuge, namely, the uncertainty of 200 units in the distances.","5556":"Consequently, I did not hesitate much here, either.","5557":"The greatest scruple by far, however, was that despite my considering and searching about almost to the point of insanity, I could not discover why the planet, to which a reciprocation LE on the diameter LK was attributed with such probability, and by so perfect an agreement with the observed distances, would rather follow an elliptical path, as shown by the equations.","5558":"O ridiculous me!","5559":"To think that the reciprocation on the diameter could not be the way to the ellipse!","5560":"So it came to me as no small revelation that the ellipse is consistent with the libration.","5561":"This will be made clear in the following chapter, where it will be demonstrated at the same time, through the agreement of arguments from physical principles with the body of experience, mentioned in this chapter, that is contained in the observations and in the vicarious hypothesis, that no orbital figure is left for the planet other than a perfectly elliptical one.","5562":"Chapter 59","5563":"Demonstration that when Mars reciprocates on the diameter of an epicycle, its orbit becomes a perfect ellipse; and that the area of the circle measures the sum of the distances of points on the circumference of the ellipse.","5564":"Protheorems1","5565":"I.\n If an ellipse be inscribed within  a circle, touching it at its vertices at opposite points, and a diameter be described through the center and the points of contact, and further, if perpendiculars be drawn to the diameter from other points on the circumference of the circle, all these lines will be cut in the same ratio by the circumference of the ellipse ^2.","5566":"Using Book I page3 21 of the Conics of Apollonius, Commandino4 proves this in his commentary on Proposition 5 of Archimedes' On Spheroids.","5567":"Let there be the circle AEC with ellipse ABC inscribed in it, touching the circle at A and C, and let the diameter be drawn through the points of contact A and C, passing through the center H.

and further, at both places the rectangle has vanished entirely.","5798":"But at an anomaly of about 45\u00b0, FD has now turned out greater than half [its maximum], because the sine, 70,711, is greater than 50,000, half the whole sine.","5799":"And its angle EHD is greater than half by still more, because the sine of the complement is also greater than half, namely, 70,711 also.","5800":"Consequently, the rectangle of the quadrant is the greatest of all, and at the same time is a square, equal to half the square on the radius, namely, 5,000,000,000.","5801":"IV","5802":"The angle of the planet's incursion from the circumference of the circle towards the diameter of the apsides is the same at the eccentric anomaly, about the center of the eccentric, and at the circular equated anomaly, of the same number of degrees, about the center of the sun.","5803":"Let the equated anomaly ANG be constructed equal to the eccentric anomaly  AHD at the circumference of the circle G; that is, let NG be drawn parallel to HD.","5804":"And from G let GX be drawn perpendicular to AC, and on it let GI be the correct incursion of the planet.","5805":"And let I and N be joined.","5806":"Now XG is to GI as VD is to DF, by I, while XG is to GN as VD is to DH, because of the similarity of the triangles.","5807":"Therefore, IG is to GN as FD is to DH.","5808":"Also, FDH and IGN are equal.","5809":"So FHD and ING are also equal.","5810":"And H is the center of the eccentric, while N is the center of the sun.","5811":"Therefore, the angle, et cetera.","5812":"Q.E.D.","5813":"V","5814":"The authentic and truest measure of the angle by which the fictitious equated anomaly, which depends upon the circle, differs from the true equated anomaly, which ends on the ellipse, is the rectangle contained by the sine of the fictitious equated anomaly and the sine of the complement of the true equated anomaly.","5815":"In the same diagram, when the sine of the angle AHD was multiplied by the sine of the angle VFH, the authentic measure of the angle FHD was going to result, by III.","5816":"But by IV, the sine of the equal angles VHD and XNG is the same, and also, the sine of VFH, XIN is the same.","5817":"Therefore, when the sine of the angle XNG, the fictitious equated anomaly, is multiplied by the sine of the angle XIN, the complement of XNI, the true equated anomaly, there results the authentic measure of the angle FHD, that is, by IV, of the angle ING, which is the difference between XNG and XNI.","5818":"Corollary","5819":"Because the difference ING is small, and is never greater than 8 minutes, the difference between the rectangles of the sines of XIN and XGN is going to be still smaller in effect.","5820":"From this, the following procedure will arise.","5821":"The angle of the true equated  anomaly being given, let its sine be multiplied by the sine of its complement.","5822":"Let double the product, with the last five digits dropped, be multiplied by the maximum angle of incursion, at an anomaly of 45\u00b0.","5823":"The product will be the angle of incursion at the given anomaly.","5824":"This, added to the true equated anomaly XNI, gives the fictitious, XNG.","5825":"By this angle, and the known sides NH, HG, the eccentric anomaly AHG is found, and the value of the triangle HGN*,  as before.","5826":"Moreover, it is not difficult to find the maximum angle at anomaly 45\u00b0.","5827":"Let VHD be 45\u00b0.","5828":"Therefore, as the whole sine is to 70,711, so is the maximum incursion, or maximum breadth of the lunule, of 429 (or, more correctly, 432) to FD, 305.","5829":"And since at 45\u00b0 HV, VD are now equal, subtract FD, 305, from VD, 70,711.","5830":"The remainder, VF, is 70,406.","5831":"This, with HV, gives the angle VHF, 44\u00b0 52' 34\", which differs from 45\u00b0 0' 0\" by only 7\u2019 26\".","5832":"And this is the maximum of the angle ING","5833":".","5834":"The following is another method using analysis, whose fundamentals are these.","5835":"In the diagram of Ch.","5836":"59, given the angle MNL, the ratio of the lines MN, NL is given, and I know that MN and LN are composed of parts in a known permuted proportion.","5837":"For MN contains the (known) whole sine, and LN contains the known eccentricity HN.","5838":"The remainder of MN has the same ratio to the remainder of LN, which is LH, as the eccentricity HN has to the whole sine ^7.","5839":"If you prefer, you may also refer to the diagram in Chapter 58.","5840":"Therefore, let MN be 100,000 + 1x,8 LN from the angle MNL, 30\u00b0, be (8,660,300,000 + 86,603x)\/100,000, and NH be 9265 or 926,500,000\/100,000, so that HL would be (7,733,800,000 + 86,603x) \/100,000.","5841":"But as HN, 9265, is to 1x, so is 100,000 to LH.","5842":"Therefore, in the second instance, HL is (100,000\/9265)x, that is, (1,079,320\/100,000)x. Previously, it was (7,733,800,000 + 86,603x)\/100,000.","5843":"With the denominators removed, as well as whatever can be subtracted equally from both sides, what remains is that 992,717x is equal to the number 7,733,800,000.","5844":"Therefore, the single root is 7790.","5845":"And MN is 107,790.","5846":"And because as HN is to this root, so is the whole to LH, LH will therefore be 84,084, which is the sine of KE, 57\u00b0 14', the complement of the eccentric anomaly AK, 32\u00b0 46'.","5847":"Now that this is found, the area AKN, the measure of the time or the mean anomaly, is found as shortly above.","5848":"These things are clearest in the diagram of Ch.","5849":"58.","5850":"Let GQ be the eccentric, AB the eccentricity, GD or LD the eccentric anomaly, FAC the equated anomaly, FA or EA the distance.","5851":"So as AK is to AB, so is BC to KE.","5852":"And at the equated anomaly CAO, as AR is to AB, so is BV to RM ^9.","5853":"So EK or RM is supposed to be one root.","5854":"The rest is as above.","5855":"But given the mean anomaly, there is no geometrical method of proceeding to the equated, that is, to the eccentric anomaly.","5856":"For the mean anomaly is composed of two parts of the area, a sector and a triangle.","5857":"And while the former is numbered by the arc of the eccentric, the latter is numbered by the  sine of that arc multiplied by the value of the maximum triangle, omitting the last digits.","5858":"And the ratios between the arcs and their sines are infinite in number.","5859":"So, the sum of the two being set out, we cannot say how great the arc is, and how great its sine, corresponding to this sum, unless we were previously to investigate the area resulting from a given arc; that is, unless you were to have constructed tables and to have worked from them subsequently.","5860":"This is my opinion.","5861":"And insofar as it is seen to lack geometrical beauty, I exhort the geometers all the more to solve me this

area.","5862":"Or, to cut the area of a semicircle in a given ratio from any given point on the diameter ^10.","5863":"It is enough for me to believe that I could not solve this a priori, owing to the

So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there. So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened. Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4.

Consequently, the angle \u03b3ND will be greater than the angle \u03b3AC. So ND will not be parallel to AB but will be inclined towards AC. Thus the planet D will not stay on the circle which it began to describe from C, the one, that is, which goes through CF, but will encroach from the circumference D and the parallel ND towards CA. And this same thing was also affirmed in the previous chapter by the distances AD computed from the observations, namely, that they do not reach all the way to the circumference of the circle CF. This same thing was also affirmed by the physical equations constructed through the summation of the distances AC, AD, namely, that the planet ought to be faster at the sides of the eccentric; that is, that its distances from the sun ought to be supposed smaller. Therefore, since this consensus brought to bear a considerable force of persuasion, I concluded forthwith that the planet's incursion at the sides is the result of this: that the power moving the planet and administering the distances according to the law of the circle supersedes the power of the sun, in that the former made equal progress in equal times thus sending the planet down uniformly towards the sun according to the law of the epicycle, while the latter, in its varying degrees [of speed obtained] through the varying distances, moved the planet in its care forward nonuniformly, and more slowly when it is high.

That error therefore began to become rooted in me which I had happily begun to refute in Chapter 39 above, that it is a property of the planetary power to lead the body of the planet around in the path of an epicycle. Had the diameter of the epicycle ND remained equidistant from AB, I could have shed my erroneous opinion, and could have ascribed (as is perfectly correct) all promotion in zodiacal longitude to the sun, leaving to the planet only the reciprocation on the diameter \u03b3\u03b6, as in part of Chapter 39. But because the observations testified that the diameter of the epicycle is inclined in the middle elongations, this error concerning the motion of the planet on the circumference of the epicycle, whose motion would be regular measured with respect to the line \u0391\u039d\u03b3 going from the sun A through the center of  the epicycle N, was admirably confirmed in me. Think yourself, reader, and you will feel the force of the argument. For I did not think it possible for the planet's orbit to be rendered oval in any other way.\nWhen, therefore, these things occurred to me, quite certain of the quantity of the incursion at the sides (that is, that the numbers would be in agreement), I celebrated another triumph over Mars. Nor did it appear to me any difficulty, if there were some discord among the numbers, to dissipate it through some slight adjustment in the equations of the center1 all around, so as to make it imperceptible.\nAnd we, good reader, can fairly indulge in so splendid a triumph for a brief day's respite (for the following five chapters, that is), meanwhile repressing the rumors of renewed rebellion, lest its splendor die before we enjoy it. If anything will be left of it afterwards, we shall go through it in the proper time and order. We are merry indeed now, but [will be] active and energetic then.","3910":"Chapter 46","3911":"How the line of the planet\u2019s motion can be described from the opinion of Chapter 45, and what its properties are.","3912":"In the preceding chapter a cause was stated by which it could happen that the planet depart from a circular orbit. However, the geometrical description of the path cannot be carried out using this model.

This is even true as well of the lines that are drawn from the center of the eccentric to those same parts of the ovoid, although otherwise the radii from the center to the circumference of a perfect circle make perfect right angles.)1 But the consequence of this is that the sum of the distances is not exactly measured by the plane surface, nor are the arcs of the ovoid exactly proportional to the distances. All these things will be clear from a rereading of Chapters 40 and 32. A guess as to how small this discrepancy is going to turn out to be, however, can be grasped from Ch. 43.","4033":"And how else can we measure this plane surface, compare it to the plane surface of a circle, and divide it into prescribed parts, unless we find a square equal to the trimmed-off part, or the lunule cut off?

Let, I say, a geometer demonstrate that the sum of the last 360, AG, AF, AM, joined together, is equal to the sum of the first 360, AI, AH, AK, joined together.","4441":" So, in this first method using the sums of the distances, I intended one thing (although erroneously and irrelevantly, namely, to add up the arcs CD or angles CBD, even though they were given at the beginning), but accomplished another, again erroneously.

Let A be the sun, B the center of the eccentric CD, BC the semidiameter. Let B, A be joined to C.

Therefore, at the anomaly CAD of 45\u00b0 I collected 45 distances at the beginning of the arcs, which are longer. Their sum was 4,869,307. I also collected 45 shorter ones, the ones at the ends of the arcs, by subtracting the longest, AD, 109,165, from the sum of the 46 distances, 4,975,577. The remainder was 4,866,412. The mean between the two sums, 4,867,852, I reduced to degrees, where 35,924,252 have the value 360\u00b0, or 99,790 have the value 1\u00b0. The result of this procedure was 48\u00b0 46' 51\". And this ought to have been the time corresponding to the angle CAD. But the arc CD or the angle CBD was also found to be about that much, 48\u00b0 42' 51\".

Therefore, these distances had too small a numerical value. Nevertheless, in order that I not lose all this labor, I subtracted the excess of this number of the elapsed time over the number of the angle CAD, from CAD, so as to leave as a remainder EAD, 41\u00b0 13' 9\", and so that AC, AE might be equal. Here it was supposed that in the time CBD the planet traverses an angle EBD about the center of the eccentric B equal to CAD, and therefore, that as many distances from A were collected for the equal arcs ED of its eccentric as we found here on equal degrees of CAD. Thus, the same number of arcs which, in this calculation of ours, were spread out over CD, which were unequal and, in this locality, too great, are now understood to be compacted within the confines of arc ED,  now divided into equal parts.

But the planet is slower on CD, owing to its greater distance from A, and the distances are the measure of the elapsed time. Therefore, at the anomaly CAD of 45\u00b0 I collected 45 distances at the beginning of the arcs, which are longer. Their sum was 4,869,307. I also collected 45 shorter ones, the ones at the ends of the arcs, by subtracting the longest, AD, 109,165, from the sum of the 46 distances, 4,975,577. The remainder was 4,866,412.

Therefore, these distances had too small a numerical value. Nevertheless, in order that I not lose all this labor, I subtracted the excess of this number of the elapsed time over the number of the angle CAD, from CAD, so as to leave as a remainder EAD, 41\u00b0 13' 9\", and so that AC, AE might be equal. Here it was supposed that in the time CBD the planet traverses an angle EBD about the center of the eccentric B equal to CAD, and therefore, that as many distances from A were collected for the equal arcs ED of its eccentric as we found here on equal degrees of CAD. Thus, the same number of arcs which, in this calculation of ours, were spread out over CD, which were unequal and, in this locality, too great, are now understood to be compacted within the confines of arc ED,  now divided into equal parts.

There we had introduced fictitious rays of power in order to be able also to ascribe to the epicycle its own task of disengaging itself from those fictitious rays (for in the truth of the matter no rays go around as slowly as the center of the planetary epicycle goes, as was said in Ch. 39). And nevertheless, we left all the physical force carrying the planet around (as concerns the effect) to the sun, so that the epicycle would only serve to adjust the distances. Here, we made use of the same power of the sun for the physical translation, while we again computed the distances from the epicycle, and gave its equal parts to equal times, that is, to equal degrees of mean anomaly, as the opinion of Ch. 45 maintains. And if we ended up taking as many distances in any given part of the time as there are degrees of equated anomaly, they are still derived from the distances of the mean anomaly, and in length they are the same. And this form is so much easier that we can here put  aside the other persuasion concerning the planet's epicyclic motion, and take one step closer to the truth of the physical cause, leaving to the epicyclic mode nothing but a reciprocation on the diameter\u2014although this is still flawed, as has was clear from these equations, at least. For, as was noted just above in considering the second method, this preoccupation with epicyclic motion is excessive, showing distances at the middle elongations that are too small, from which it happens that at that place the planet exceeds its measure of velocity, and at the apsides falls short of its measure. But it suffices us to express the opinion of Ch. 45 in our calculation. Therefore, although one might here raise the objection from Ch. 32 that this ratio of diurnal motions cannot be constant, since the parts of the eccentric near the apsides are presented directly to the sun, and the intermediate are presented obliquely, so that they thus appear differently from the way they would if they were presented directly\u2014 if anyone, I say, were to raise this objection, I shall answer as I did in Ch. 49, that this obliquity at the intermediate parts is added by the planet in its own right, and is produced through its descent. Thus, it is not to be imputed to the motive cause arising from the sun, nor is it affected by that cause.","4591":"The eccentricity is again charged with being less than it should be. With  this corrected, the difference above, at 41\u00b0, will be about 8'+, and below, about 7\u00bd\u2019\u2014. Thus here, too, the planet is not made to go fast enough at the apsides, and so there are too many distances near the apsides, and consequently less than there should be at the middle elongations.

In the earlier observation, the observed latitude was 6\u2154 North. And because Mars was near the earth, and the angle at the sun was 10\u00b0 17', while at the earth it was 28\u00b0 41', this latitude requires an  inclination of 2' 30\". Therefore, in our later observation the inclination will also be 2' 30\", or a little less, since we are 8' closer to the node. But with the inclination assumed to be 2' 30\", since here the angle at the sun is 61\u00b0, and at earth 38\u00b0, a latitude of about 1' 50\" N. must follow, as indicated by our parallactic table ^6. But by using the refraction of the fixed stars, we were left with a latitude of 3' 29\" N., while by using the solar refraction we were moved down to 0\u00b0 33' S. Thus in the second our refraction was greater than would be correct, and in the first, less. So the correct refraction is between the two, namely, 3' 36\". That is, for us Mars will be put at 8\u00b0 46\u2153\u2018 Sagittarius. Let O be the sun, B and A points on the earth\u2019s orbit, A the position of the earth in the earlier observation, B in the later, M Mars. Let the lines be connected. And although Mars does not return to exactly the same place, let it nonetheless be represented in both instances by the line OM. Thus MAO is 28\u00b0 41' 14\", and AO is 101,365. Let MO, the distance of Mars from the sun (which is being sought here), be taken as if known, and let it be 154,200. Thus OM will fall at 15\u00b0 31' 3\" Scorpio. And if OM is assumed to be 154,200 in the earlier observation, it ought to be taken as shorter in the later one. Now one degree at this place on the eccentric changes the distance by 240 units, whatever form you use for constructing the distances ^7. Therefore, since the mean longitudes here differ by 13 minutes, and when a subtraction is made to account for precession, only eight, the proportional part of 240 is 32. Consequently, in the second observation, we have assumed OM to be 154,168. But OBM is also known, it being 38\u00b0 0' 40\", and OB is 98,232. Therefore, OMB is given as 23\u00b0 6' 11\". Consequently, on the second occasion OM was at 15\u00b0 40' 9\" Scorpio, differing from the earlier eccentric position by 9 minutes. It should have differed by somewhat more. For the mean anomalies differed by 8' 3\", to which corresponds 7' 49\" in the equated anomaly of the eccentric at this place. Add to these the intervening precession of the equinoxes of 4' 48\".

For the sake of consensus, we shall also add an observation of October 1597. In the other years it was not observed at this eccentric position. For the eccentric position falls at 10\u00b0 Gemini. Thus Mars was observed last at this place in  November 1580 ^9. In 1582 its arrival at the place fell in October, when [Tycho's] great interest in observing was not yet aroused. In 1584 it came in September, in 1586 in July, in 1588 in June, in 1590 in April, and in 1592 in March, at which times, being near the sun owing to the short, bright nights in Denmark, it was neglected, while, whenever there was an opportunity, they were intent upon the fixed stars, the moon, and the other planets. But at the end of 1593 and the beginning of 1594, when it was at quadrature with the sun, the observation was not continued beyond this aspect because astronomers are usually chiefly interested in the quadrature. So, in 1595 Dec. 17 at 7h 6m in the evening the planet was observed at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, with latitude 1\u00b0 40' 44\" N ^10. The sun's position was 5\u00b0 39' 3\" Capricorn. Its distance from earth was 98,200.","4685":"The mean longitude of Mars is concluded to be 2s 2\u00b0 4' 22\".","4686":" And since the aphelion is 4s 28\u00b0 58' 10\", the distance of the position from aphelion is 86\u00b0 53' 48\" backwards. Previously, it was nearly the same as that, namely, 87\u00b0 9' 24\". Therefore, these two positions are nearly the same distance from aphelion. Now from our vicarious hypothesis, there corresponds to this simple anomaly an equated anomaly of 76\u00b0 25' 48\". Which, subtracted from the position of the aphelion, leaves Mars's eccentric position, 12\u00b0 32' 22\" Gemini. Let A be the earth, O the sun, M Mars. AO is given as 98,200. And because OM is at 12\u00b0 32' 22\" Gemini, while AM is at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, therefore AMO is 31\u00b0 0' 55\". And because AO is at 5\u00b0 39' 3\" Capricorn, while AM is at 11\u00b0 31' 27\" Taurus, therefore, the supplement of OAM is 54\u00b0 7' 36\". Hence, since the sine of OAM is to OM as the sine of AMO is to AO, OM comes out to be 154,432. And since this position is 15 minutes closer to the apogee than the one from 1589, and at this position on the eccentric 1\u00b0 causes a change of 240 units, therefore 60 units are to be subtracted for 15 minutes, since at positions farther removed from aphelion the distances are shorter. The distance thus comes out to be 154,372. On the other hand, since the node is at about 16\u00b0 20' Taurus, and the eccentric position is 12\u00b0 32' Gemini, the planet is 26\u00b0 12' from the node. And the maximum inclination of the planes is 1\u00b0 50'. Therefore, the inclination at this place is 48' 32\". The secant of this exceeds the radius by 10 units, or in our dimensions, 15\u00bd. So the distance of the actual point on Mars's orbit from the sun is 154,387. And previously, at this distance from aphelion it was found to be approximately 154,400 from the sun. Therefore, the distances of these two points on the eccentric from the sun is equal to within a hair's breadth. For the 13 units that are wanting in the latter distance are of no importance.

So if we also subtract that much from the other two AKs, so as to make them 138,954 and 139,000, the resulting angles are DKA 34\u00b0 43' 47\" and AK 20\u00b0 9' 40\" [Pisces]; while FKA is 12\u00b0 1' 24\" and AK 20\u00b0 55' 15\" [Pisces].

In itself it  is rather inadequate, since the rotations of the oar and the river are accomplished, not in the same time, but a double time. Furthermore, to those looking at them from earth, the faces of the planets should appear to change, while the face of the moon, although it participates with the planets in that motion which we are discussing, does not change over the course of a month. Instead, it always is turned towards the earth, whence its eccentricity is reckoned. In addition, while the force of a river is material (for its water acts by its weight and material impetus), the force of the sun is immaterial. Therefore, the comparison with the planets ought to be different: they will need no oar, no physical instrument, for catching hold of the force of some weighty thing (for that motive species of the sun has no weight). Nor do we deem it fitting that the stars have a corporeal oar, seeing that we hold them to be round.\n But from this very refutation, there comes another example, which will perhaps be more suitable. The river and the oar are of the same quality. The river is an immaterial species of magnetic power in the sun. So why not have the oar too borrow something from the magnet? What if all the bodies of the planets are enormous round magnets? Of the earth (one of the planets, for  Copernicus) there is no doubt.

For all those effects are obtained by having the earth\u2019s axis, about which the diurnal motion is made, retain a single, constant direction: there is no need for extrinsic causes, except to account only for the extremely slow precession of the equinoxes.

But despite its sunseeking magnetic nature, let it remain ever parallel to itself in the translational motion of the globe, except to the extent that over the ages it transfers the polar inclination from one of the fixed  stars to another, thus causing the progressive motion of the aphelion.

For as long as the axis of the earth, in the annual circulation of its center, remains almost perfectly equidistant from  itself in all its positions, summer and winter are brought about.* On the other hand, insofar as very long ages cause it to incline, the fixed stars are thought to move forward, and the equinoxes to retrogress.\nWhy, then, should we have doubts about attributing to all the planets, in order to save the phenomena of eccentricity, something that is observed to be in one of them (that is, the earth) because of the phenomena of the precession of the equinoxes and the sun's annual cycle of rising and falling?\nCopernicus, for example, was deceived here when he thought that he needed a special principle to cause the earth to reciprocate annually from north to south and back so as to produce summer and winter, and to bring about the equality of the tropical and sidereal years (to the extent that they are equal) by constructing it in a manner commensurate with its revolution. For all those effects are obtained by having the earth\u2019s axis, about which the diurnal motion is made, retain a single, constant direction: there is no need for extrinsic causes, except to account only for the extremely slow precession of the equinoxes. And so here, too, there is on no account any need for movers for the planet, which would carry its body about the sun in a parallel position, and at the same time perform the reciprocation.

For suppose that this force of directing the axis towards the sun does detract somewhat from the retentive power, commensurate with the ratio of the two. Accordingly, in the aphelial semicircle, as at C, the point will gradually incline towards H (that is, backward), and the tail end will turn away from the sun, gradually overcoming the retentive force. Thus the aphelion will become retrograde. But in the perihelial semicircle, as at F, the same point will incline towards G (that is, forward), again overcoming the contrary retentive force. Thus the aphelion will then be made to move forward, and to be fast. But because AF is shorter than AC, and the sun is closer to F than to C, the force tending to turn the magnetic axis towards the sun is therefore stronger at F than at C.

Therefore, by the converse of Euclid VI. 3, the angle \u03b3\u03be\u03b6 is divided into two equal parts by the line \u03be\u03bf, and \u03b3\u03be\u03bf is half of \u03b3\u03be\u03b6, the total increase of the sun's diameter. Q. E. D. It is therefore certain at both ends and the middle that in this way, if the diameter of the reciprocation is divided by the planet in proportion to the versed sines of the eccentic anomaly, the sun's diameter would increase in  proportion to the versed sines of the equated anomaly.","5376":"To make it more evident, this is clear in part from the following. Let the straight line BL be drawn from B perpendicular to CF, and about center A, with radius equal to BC, let an arc be drawn intersecting BL at L, and let AL be joined. Since the eccentric anomaly CBL is 90\u00b0, the versed sine will be CB, 100,000, half of the whole diameter, and consequently the reciprocation will be \u03b3\u03b2, half of the whole \u03b3\u03b6. Also, the distance will be \u03b2\u03b1. But AL is equal to it by construction. Thus the planet will be at L. And because AL is equal to BC or BM, and BA is a common side, and LBA is right, as well as MAB, therefore, the triangles BMA, ALB are congruent. So BL is equal to AM. But AM is equal to \u03b1\u03bd, as above, and therefore BL is equal to it also. But \u03b1\u03bd, which lies opposite the right angle \u03b1\u03bf\u03bd, is longer than \u03b1\u03bf, which subtends the acute angle \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf. Therefore, BL is also longer than \u03b1\u03bf, and AL is longer than BL. Thus AL is much longer than \u03b1\u03bf. Therefore, the sun appears smaller at the distance AL than at the distance \u03b1\u03bf. But the distance \u03b1\u03bf was just now seen to be the mean between the maximum and the minimum. Thus at distance AL the sun appears less than the mean. So at L, even though half the semicircle of the eccentric has been traversed, less than half of the increase has been added to the sun's diameter.

Thus is established a perpetual circulation which does not occur by leaps such as we have supposed in our thinking and calculation, ignoring imperceptible errors, but is quite continuous.","5450":" What I have said so far holds conditionally, if the reciprocation supported by the observations cannot be performed by some magnetic power, implanted in the bodies of the planets, and if it has become absolutely necessary for us to have recourse to a mind.

Since the planet takes a longer time on arc A than on arc C proportionally as NA is longer than NC, while NA and NC taken together equal the longer diameter of the ellipse, and HB is the shorter semidiameter of the ellipse, the planet's amount of time on the arc at B and the opposite arc together will therefore be less than on the equal arcs at A and C together ^20. Therefore, to make the amount of time at A and C shorter, and at B and its opposite longer, thus making the amount of time on any two opposite arcs taken together the same, the arcs at A and C should be made smaller, and at B and its opposite, longer.

With the denominators removed, as well as whatever can be subtracted equally from both sides, what remains is that 992,717x is equal to the number 7,733,800,000. Therefore, the single root is 7790.

Therefore, let MN be 100,000 + 1x,8 LN from the angle MNL, 30\u00b0, be (8,660,300,000 + 86,603x)\/100,000, and NH be 9265 or 926,500,000\/100,000, so that HL would be (7,733,800,000 + 86,603x) \/100,000. But as HN, 9265, is to 1x, so is 100,000 to LH. Therefore, in the second instance, HL is (100,000\/9265)x, that is, (1,079,320\/100,000)x. Previously, it was (7,733,800,000 + 86,603x)\/100,000. With the denominators removed, as well as whatever can be subtracted equally from both sides, what remains is that 992,717x is equal to the number 7,733,800,000. Therefore, the single root is 7790. And MN is 107,790. And because as HN is to this root, so is the whole to LH, LH will therefore be 84,084, which is the sine of KE, 57\u00b0 14', the complement of the eccentric anomaly AK, 32\u00b0 46'.
