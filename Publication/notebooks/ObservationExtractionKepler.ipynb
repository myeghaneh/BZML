For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4° 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4° 31'. It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4° 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.</td>\n",
