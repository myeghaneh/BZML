And this line, with that same center N, would be now slow,  now swift, again contrary to what was said above, that the power always produces the same speed at the same distance. Moreover, we would be required to suppose that the  planet has its own rotatory motion away from this imaginary ray AN in the opposite direction, traversing unequal distances in equal times, according as this ray itself  were swifter or slower. In adopting this account, we would indeed approach more closely the geometrical suppositions of the ancients, but we would stray very far from physical theory, as is shown in Ch. 2.

       "3349  And although the power driving the planets is faster than any of them, as is shown in Chapter 34, we are here to suppose in our imagination a single ray of power AN  coming from the sun, as if there were a line upon which the center of the epicycle N would always remain. And this line, with that same center N, would be now slow,  now swift, again contrary to what was said above, that the power always produces the same speed at the same distance. Moreover, we would be required to suppose that the  planet has its own rotatory motion away from this imaginary ray AN in the opposite direction, traversing unequal distances in equal times, according as this ray itself  were swifter or slower. In adopting this account, we would indeed approach more closely the geometrical suppositions of the ancients, but we would stray very far from physical theory, as is shown in Ch. 2. And my thoughts on the matter have not sufficed to discover a way in which these things can happen naturally.   \n",

But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". Therefore Mars was 7s 6° 31' 45\" from Cor Leonis.   \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.</td>\n",

The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward.

Since the present angle is greater, the distance of Mars from the earth turns out to be less than the distance of Mars from the sun. The apparent magnitude of the inclination—at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic—is consequently greater. But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1° 50’.</td>\n",

Mars’s altitude was 22⅕°, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3½’. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun’s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24° Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64° from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5’ 24“. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1° 9’ 45“ north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26°, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2’ 38“.

Now this observation is distant and isolated. It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3.    \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.   \n",

The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24’ 15”. The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward. Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21° 10’ 30” Leo, which is what was accepted. There is no mention of parallax. Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky. I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored.   \n",

This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. It therefore should have been 25° 8’ 32” Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9.    \n",

There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. They took the value of 3° 58’ 10”.

The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1° 15’ westward. Therefore, Mars would have been at 2° 30½’ Cancer. In the table, it was put at 2° 28’. The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date. Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind. Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely. But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man’s lifetime, for examining Mars’s parallax.   \n",

Therefore, from 8h 28½m in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46½m, it was observed to retrogress 9⅔’.   \n",
       "10  On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23° 29’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51°. The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43° 58’ from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15°. And, measured by the straight edge, Mars was perfectly collinear with the two stars. And so, since Mars’s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars. This is obtained here as follows. On January 16 at 10½h it was 23° 27’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius. On January 17 at 10⅗h 12 it was 23° 12½’ from the same star. Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14½’. Now in order to comply with Brahe’s advice, we must set out the distance between the foot of Erichthonius and Cor Leonis, which is found to be 67° 21’. Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23° 29’, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43° 52’, at 7½h in the evening, which...   \n",

The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5. Nearly all of this was latitudinal. Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic. For on February 6 it was already at about 7’ northern latitude ^6.    \n",

The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun. Refraction, on the other hand, is large: 6’ 45” from the table for the fixed stars, or 11 minutes from the table for the sun ^12. This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13. Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude—about 2 or 3, or even more.   \n",

The sun is thus only 62½˚ from Mars, although it should have been 72° from Mars in order to make the triangle isosceles, as the problem requires. Therefore, Mars is then farther from the earth than from the sun. Consequently, its latitude at that place appeared less than was the true inclination.   \n",

Therefore, since the sun was 73½° from Mars, the digression of the point which Mars then occupied on its orbit was a little less than 1° 53½’ (since there should have been  72° between Mars and the sun). Since the present angle is greater, the distance of Mars from the earth turns out to be less than the distance of Mars from the sun. The apparent magnitude of the inclination—at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic—is consequently greater. But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1° 50’.   \n",

It should have been farther. Consequently, the line between Mars and the earth was longer than that between Mars and the sun.

The sun was at 30° Pisces, 76 degrees from Mars. It should have been a little closer. Therefore, Mars’s true digression from the ecliptic was a little less than the observed latitude. However, this digression was not at its maximum, since Mars had not yet approached within about 25 degrees of the limit. So once again, indirect support is provided for a maximum digression of about 1° 50’ at the limit.   \n",

(For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2° 18⅔’,20 and on October 2 it was 2° 38½‘.) The sun was at 2½° Scorpio, above the node. The earth was therefore below the node towards Mars. So because of this proximity, the observed latitude was greater than the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic. Fourteen days later, when the sun was at the node, if it were again to have decreased 28 minutes (the amount of decrease in the previous 14 days), there would remain 1° 45’. But the ratio of decrease does not remain the same when the earth departs from a star, or vice versa. For at a greater distance the decrease is always less. Therefore nothing can be adduced here against a maximum inclination of 1° 50’. On the contrary: it is indirectly confirmed.   \n",

Since at the given time the sun stood at 0° 45’ 36“ Sagittarius, and its motion over five days is 5° 5’, the sum of the two motions will come to 7° 0’. But the sun is 7° 51’ 24“ removed from opposition to Mars. Of this, seven degrees exactly are traversed in 5 days, or 120 hours. So, according to the same ratio, the remaining 51’ 24“ will be traversed in 14 hours 41 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m. Its position was 6° 28’ Gemini on the ecliptic. Now this is 20° away from 16½° Taurus.

The distance was 1° 3’ 20“. The sun’s diurnal motion was 61’ 16“, that of Mars 24’ 15“, and their sum 85’ 31“. Now as 1° 25’ 31“ is to 24 hours, so is 1° 3’ 20“ to 17 hours 46 minutes, to which correspond about 18’ of Mars’s motion. Therefore the time was January 30 at 19h 14m, and Mars’s ecliptic position was 21° 36’ 10“ Leo. For reduction, some very small quantity is subtracted, because Mars is then beyond the limit. Therefore, the extension of the arc on the orbit from the following node is directed westward. But because Mars was only 4 or 5 degrees from the node, the subtraction is rendered quite imperceptible. The latitude, on the authority of the Tychonic table, was 4° 32’ 10“ north. For the observation on January 31 at 12h gave 4° 31’.

       "29  On the night following 1587 March 4, at 1h 16m past midnight, the position of Mars was found to be 26° 26’ 17“ Virgo,8 from Cor Leonis9 and Spica Virginis, with an observed latitude of 3° 38’ 16“ north. But because Mars was elevated 37½° above the horizon, diurnal parallax comes into the reckoning, and subtracts some small quantity from the longitude, thus making it 26° 26’ Virgo, with a slightly greater latitude. For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars’s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun’s. On the supposition that the sun’s is 3’, Mars’s will be about 5’. Now when 9° Sagittarius is rising, the nonagesimal10 is 55° from the zenith. Opposite this number in our parallactic table,11 under the column headed 5’, the latitudinal parallax 4’ is shown. Therefore, the latitude observed from the center of the earth would be 3° 42’ 22“ north.
